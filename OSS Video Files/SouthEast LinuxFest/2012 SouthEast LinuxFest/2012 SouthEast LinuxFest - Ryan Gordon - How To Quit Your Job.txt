moment here but okay just a few notes

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,320

fun of me personally it's a dick euless

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,030
on twitter if you have a question yell

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,949

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,909
have an objection if you have anything

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,229
this talk can go in any direction so if

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,390
you know you don't like where it's going

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,770
we'll just change it as we go also

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,119
PowerPoint makes you dumb so we're

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,840
there's only like five slides and this

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,040
and the next one's of my baby so that

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,750
might be distracting we won't leave that

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,670
one up there okay good okay so a little

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,950
bit about me my name is ryan i have not

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,960
had a normal job in over a decade which

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,490
is kind of nice I haven't been

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,900
unemployed I've been working regularly I

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,180
just haven't actually had a nine-to-five

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,220
job and I don't even know how long I

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,930
started out I went to college in

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,850
Charlotte it's nice for southeast linux

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,710
fest to be here in Charlotte this year I

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,460
went to school here moved away for a

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,770
little while I've not lived here again

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,540
out of college I got a job working at a

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,310
place that did Java applications and

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,020
they had a three-tiered architecture for

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,640
you know customer relationship

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,090
management and it was the most boring

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,530
thing I've ever worked on I recommend

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,549
not ever getting into that job if you

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,360
see that job walk out of that job I

00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,409
think they're still in business they

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
might even be in this room if they're

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,080
also looking to quit their job

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,240
I got a lucky break there's something

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,280
called a deal in Atlanta Linux showcase

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,230
many years ago and the company called

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,790
low key software came down there and had

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,020
this competition where you could sign up

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,340
you could go down there you could work

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,550
on the source code to this video game

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,780
called civilization to which was

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,750
brilliant and I was obsessed with this

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,340
game so I got in the car and I drove

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,530
down there you had 48 hours you didn't

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,610
you didn't get to sleep you had to work

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,250
on this thing and build something

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,440
interesting they didn't care what and a

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,270
bunch of people did bunch of interesting

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,950
things and some people one some people

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,020
lost they gave a rewards for the most

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,220
interesting things and my reward was

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,330
that I actually got a job at low key

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,160
software so i moved across the country

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,630
and started working on porting video

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,060
games to linux professional it was my

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,920
last full-time job when that company

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,420
went out of business i moved back in

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,370
with my parents up in Pennsylvania which

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,290
was miserable if you ever have the

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,670
chance to do this I recommend you not do

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,170
it and from there is working a cybercafe

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,180
of working the cash register that my

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,680
friend of mine had a cyber cafe and and

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,420
I hated it and I was playing a lot of a

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,400
game called serious sam at the time so

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,720
you never played Serious Sam it's great

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,730
it's like a more modern version of doom

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,900
it's just how much abuse your character

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,760
can take is you run through these levels

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,720
that's very funny and intense and and i

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,190
love this game and i played it all the

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,930
time and i figured you know I've done

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,700
this before I've ported games to linux i

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,930
used to get paid to do that so i

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,850
searched around the internet and I found

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,650
the only email address i could find for

00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,019
the people at crow team which is the

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,150
company that made serious Sam and I i

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,910
sent them an email said laid out this

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,200
big complicated argument about why they

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,430
need to make a linux port of this game

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,840
it would help them if they want to get

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,730
on the playstation 2 because it uses the

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,100
same compiler and it'll help them find

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,660
bugs and it's an emerging market and

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,910
blahdy blahdy blahdy and the guy wrote

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,110
back said I'm just an artist okay well

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,670
it's the only email address i could find

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,350
but he was nice enough to forward it on

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,989
to the people who actually make these

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,480
decisions they let me port their game to

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,799
linux and from there other people

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,150
started emailing me and say hey we saw

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,100
you did this linux port are you

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,750
available to do some work for us and and

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,120
ended up doing games like medal of honor

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,170
and unreal tournament from there and

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,420
stuff like that and it's kind of

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,709
spiraled out of control from there so

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,180
now I'm a freelance I don't work for

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,650
people people have offered me jobs and I

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,390
turn them down because you can't beat

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,590
some of the perks of working for

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,079
yourself and I'm going to get into that

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,310
briefly here so I'm gonna tell you what

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,430
I like about being a freelance and I'm

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,949
going to tell you what's really bad

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,600
being a freelance and if you're still

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,610
here after that what's bad about it then

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,009
I'll tell you how to do it yourself I'll

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,300
give you some basic advice okay so the

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,220
first thing about being a freelance is

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,070
you make more money it's just really

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,479
that simple if you have a nine-to-five

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,710
job you probably have a salary you're

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,750
probably if your program you're probably

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,949
not hourly maybe I don't know if your

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,900
hourly you should definitely get out of

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:48,570
that job so I but once you're making

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,650
your own hours and your own contracts

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,300
and you're working with a variety of

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,400
people you can make much much more money

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,349
than you can make hourly which is great

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,630
there's a lot more variety you don't

00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:59,039
ever find yourself for the most part

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,479
thinking God had been working on this

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,590
project for three years and I hate it

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,789
usually it's like I've been working on

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,080
this project for two months and I'm done

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,360
with it I'm moving on to something more

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,830
interesting so in the worst case you

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,690
never have to deal with crap for too

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:15,330
long you never have to deal with this

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:16,830
guy which is probably the highlight also

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,090
I don't have a slide for this which I

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:24,810
think you'll appreciate but you never

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:26,310
have to wear pants you you um I spend a

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,310
joke society spend a good portion of my

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,270
working day in my pajamas because I can

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,440
it's one of the benefits is that you

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,180
don't have to be presentable from day to

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,590
day you know you can be comfortable you

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,870
don't have to be disgusting you know but

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,750
your coworkers are like your house pets

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,919
and that's it which is pretty nice

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,770
there's a lot less structure is what I'm

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,150
getting at here um you if you want if

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,190
you find that you work best overnight

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,389
people generally don't care and every

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,940
contract is different but generally as

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,020
long as you're showing up with with

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,220
deliverable work they don't care if you

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,780
do it in the middle of the night if you

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,710
do it if you're most productive at eight

00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,509
in the morning or if you're most

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,970
productive it was six in the evening

00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,139
after dinner you know and I think most

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,430
people will find that they vary from

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,810
time to time a one that's certainly a

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,159
stayed up all night cramming for

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,240
something in college will know that some

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,159
days you're just more productive in the

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
middle of night nobody cares if you're

00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,300
there at nine in the morning punching a

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,830
time card which is really nice and this

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,720
is nice for me there's less human

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,400
contact I've had entire I've had

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,050
thousands of dollars worth of contracts

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,880
where people have emailed me I've

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,620
emailed them back I've done work they've

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
mailed me a check and I've never even

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,759
spoken to them on the phone so that's

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,099
the if you don't really like people very

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,490
much like me then you might find that

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,449
you really enjoy working as a freelance

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,340
okay so those are the real Ben

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,659
hits by the way thing was thirsty I

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,789
brought my own water but there's a water

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:41,669
bottle back there if you Spencer if you

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,229
want some of your own okay why would you

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,550
not want to do this there's less money

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,529
okay i know i just said there's more

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,819
money i'm sorry about that but the thing

00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,110
is when you're starting out especially

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,580
when you're starting out you're probably

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,589
making less than if you just walk into a

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,969
salary job you're probably making a lot

00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:55,919
less in fact if you don't have some

00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:57,870
savings you might be really eating a lot

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,490
of ramen noodles to get through your the

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,809
first couple months of it it depends on

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,129
a lot of factors everything I'm going to

00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:03,719
tell you here is very general and every

00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,039
situation is very unique but especially

00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,870
the game there's less money more

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,150
importantly there's no medical benefits

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,199
there's no 401k plan so what you're

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,629
basically doing is you're trading a

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,180
safety net from your salary place with

00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:18,659
benefits for more freedom possibly more

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,860
money it's a it's a gamble and if you

00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,419
like it you like it if you can't do it

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,520
you can't do it the other thing is this

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,969
is that you know you don't have that

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,539
jackass boss anymore but now you have

00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:31,710
hundreds of these guys on that you spend

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,319
less time dealing with interactive

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,089
individually but they can of any given

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,979
contract you can have imagined that

00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,539
really rides you or you can have someone

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,719
who wants ridiculous things that don't

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:44,099
make any sense and you know and but the

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,120
good news is these people go away every

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,430
couple of months as you finish the

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,300
project so you know if you get lumbered

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,499
you can move on from that okay if you're

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,029
interested in building interesting

00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,709
things and you're not interested in

00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,839
hustling and making money and keeping

00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,919
books you shouldn't be a freelance the

00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,180
the thing that everyone talks about

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,069
working for the man they don't want to

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,330
work for the man but the nice thing

00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,229
about working for the man is someone

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,159
else's worried about running the

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,409
business and you're worried about

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,729
building beautiful things running a

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:10,229
business cuts into the building

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,029
beautiful things time you don't want to

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:13,740
if that's the thing that you are most

00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,300
interested in you have to be either

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,229
willing to trade that off or not do it

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,629
because you're going to spend an awful

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:23,610
lot of time hustlin um blah blah blah

00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,209
money isn't everything I wrote that down

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,209
I don't know why

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,680
but I think a lot of people come in here

00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:32,089
this is what I noticed coming into the

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,599
door of Southeast linux fest this year

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,310
there are 22 sessions on SQL of various

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,539
types various databases and stuff its

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,580
twenty three if you count Richard hips

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,529
talk because he wrote SQL light but he's

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,600
not specifically talking about it but I

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,709
can't help but feel like there's

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,740
probably some people in this room right

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,329
now because they're tired of being a

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,829
linux guy or being an open-source guy

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,470
and just be like oh that means that your

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:56,959
database administrator right no god stop

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,040
asking me that you know I will not fix

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,870
your computer for you I I feel like

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
there's a lot of people that don't work

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,050
for the man because that's what the man

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,750
is it's a lot of repetitive boring

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,220
interchangeable work and I can

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,510
sympathize with that because I cringe it

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,160
that myself and I created that when I

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,329
used to do this for a living where you

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,339
know I hated getting up every day and

00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:19,070
figuring out how to talk to the database

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,779
that manages customer relationships it

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,079
was boring and uninteresting and

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,450
uninspired and and restricting and it

00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,680
was painful for me I didn't like it but

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,450
that being said I think a lot of people

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,829
are afraid of working for the man

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,880
because they don't want a normal job but

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,220
they're using the wrong word they don't

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,720
want a boring job so above everything

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,430
else if you don't want to be a freelance

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,230
you need to quit your boring job you

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,880
need to go find an interesting job it

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,560
can be a normal job can be on salary

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,950
nine to five you can require you to wear

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,329
pants every day but don't mistake boring

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,010
and normal they're two totally different

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:54,589
things okay so are you still with me

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,120
okay good the rest of this is going to

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,560
be about what you should be doing and

00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,490
some basic advice about it so I just

00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,779
want to make sure no one to run

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,980
screaming from the room like oh my god

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:05,570
what am I doing here I should be at the

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,250
Maria DB session instead because you

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,880
know more SQL is always better than last

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,899
right okay so here's what you do first

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,699
things first if you want to be a

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:15,640
freelance you find a vertical market if

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:17,870
you want to do database administration

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,520
everyone does it and I think about in

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,510
the 90s everyone that was in college

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,640
that heard there were some money in this

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,839
comm thing was learning visual basic

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,339
because they didn't really understand

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,750
what the dot-com think was doing but you

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,920
know it's you know you could always pick

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,079
these people out if you went to college

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,850
and there's computer science department

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,410
and you looked at the people in the pure

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,450
science classes most of them were pretty

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:41,430
freaking dumb am i right

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:43,050
you're laughing because you know it is

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,610
very very easy to stand out from the

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,200
herd and there's a million people that

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,760
took a visual basic course or in more

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,320
modern times it took a Java course and

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,820
don't even really understand Java but

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,740
they got through the course somehow and

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,060
they're all fighting for jobs but you

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,680
know if your resume is a little bit

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,630
better than that then you have a hundred

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,080
dumbasses and one person that's slightly

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,460
better than a dumbass you're doing okay

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,720
I hope you're slightly better than a

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,910
dumb as I hope you're much more than

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,350
much better than that but you know it's

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,610
trivial to stand out to think that you

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,560
have nothing to offer is probably the

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,660
wrong way to think about it but what you

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,830
want to do in an ideal terms is find

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,790
that vertical market you want to find

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,490
the thing where there's a lot of money

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,870
and nobody working on it and I'll my

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,550
life had been a little lucky in that and

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,350
that I used to do java I just made fun

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,570
of Java by used to Java when nobody did

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,850
it because it was cool on OS to believe

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,430
it or not so I learned java very very

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,440
very heavily and I was writing stuff in

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,760
it all the time and and I went to go

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,490
work for a company was doing Java when

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,780
nobody was doing that and it you're

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,580
almost guaranteed an instant hire

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,320
because they couldn't find warm bodies

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,640
that knew how to do it and then after

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,740
that I went to go work on porting stuff

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,390
to linux and that's still a fairly

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,310
vertical market I mean probably everyone

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,510
in Charlotte that knows how to pour

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,370
something from Windows to Linux is

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,370
sitting in this room right now and

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,760
taking that a step further not only for

00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,870
yourself the links preparing video games

00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,910
to Linux which is a different set of

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,460
skills than just generally porting and

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,690
stuff if you can find a vertical market

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,130
where there's very few people doing it

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,180
it's much easier to get work and it's

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,430
much easier to get work when you're

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,100
starting out if you're just trying to go

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,910
out there and build lamp machines for

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,960
people you know linux apache mysql PHP

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,400
one that's a miserable life and to

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,140
everybody's doing that so at a minimum

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,760
if you can find work you're gonna have

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,170
to charge too little for that work you

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,880
don't want to do that you want to think

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,650
about what you're good at and you want

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,910
to go and sell yourself doing that and

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,550
say it's something that nobody else is

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,840
doing I can't tell you what that is for

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,550
me it was video games and it was Linux

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,530
but for you it could be any number of

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,940
things and look look around your desk

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,280
top of the things that piss you off and

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,810
try and make them better and say well if

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,370
I'm if I'm the only one thinking about

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,780
this how can i make money off of it for

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,520
example now I'm talking about doing

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,840
service stuff here if you someone says I

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,160
have a project I need you to write it I

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,660
pay you and then we go our separate ways

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,280
it's not unheard of that you could also

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,810
build a piece of software and then sell

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,460
services for it for example before they

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,040
got bought by sun microsystems that was

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,530
my SQL tactic they would sell services

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,520
to mysql certainly other companies have

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,320
done that to certainly there are

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,270
distributions of Linux that have made

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,050
millions of dollars likes a red hat

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,310
doing that but that's very very hard to

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,450
start out because you have a long time

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,040
where you're making no money while you

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,300
build something interesting and then you

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,450
hope it's interesting for other people

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,090
but it's an option you can do it it's

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,470
just not what I'm talking about today

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,210
when you're going into when you find

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,440
these vertical markets the way yours but

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,090
you should be selling yourself is not

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,280
what you know it's what you can figure

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,840
out very very quickly you always want to

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,910
be presenting yourself as someone who

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,920
can take something they've never seen

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,420
before stare at it for a moment and then

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,910
solve it it chances are if you've ever

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,050
had a package crash on gentoo you

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,160
probably are good at this because you've

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,960
probably had to solve a lot of things

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,330
you've never seen before as you go along

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,500
as an example I come to think that if

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,850
you've ever tried to get a video card

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,550
driver working on Linux you've probably

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,830
had this problem if you've ever

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,160
configured a colonel do people still do

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,210
that all right good and that's why you

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,010
should be working for yourself the

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,210
people have said yes because most people

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,740
don't especially now that Linux is

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,360
getting a little more user friendly like

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,010
if you're using you Bunty you probably

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,150
didn't build your own kernel if using

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,090
slackware you definitely did let me here

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,350
for the slack word people that's why i

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:18,010
love about self the slack where people

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:23,080
come out in force yeah so was i saying

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:25,360
that you yeah ok moving on so I gotta

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,950
one up for slackware I'm feeling good ok

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,420
so now you have it you have something

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:32,620
you want to sell you have a product its

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,970
name is you you have a product you want

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,590
to sell you want to milk your contacts

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,060
if you're just starting out everyone has

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,770
contacts and they don't necessarily know

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,630
they do how many of you are still in

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:45,310
college undergrad graduate school

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:47,290
alright that one person good for you if

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,030
you're in college you have way more

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,650
contacts than you think you do there's

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,940
and I'm thinking talking like the Career

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,920
Center but certainly that's also an

00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,810
option too but in terms of other hackers

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,280
people you've met on the internet people

00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,720
at the school who can say oh I have

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,490
somebody that will pay somebody to do

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,070
something or other and start building a

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,330
resume from there

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,920
from there you also want to do some open

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,480
source actually you want to a lot of

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,040
open source one of the things I love

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,780
best about my jobs i never have to sign

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,940
something saying i wrote this thing in

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,860
my spare time can the company please let

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,620
me release it is open source I hate that

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,210
policy companies that do that suck they

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,330
should just let you release stuff if

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,830
it's not causing problems or donated to

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,330
the Apache foundation or something like

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,650
that but the beautiful thing about

00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,700
working for yourself is if you have an

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,110
itch you want to scratch you write a

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,450
stupid little perl script that does

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,220
something great or you build this big

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:36,160
complex framework that does something

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,660
powerful you just put it on github you

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,390
don't have to worry about it your boss

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,120
never tells you that you can't put it on

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,500
github you know you're you never have to

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,840
go through legal to have them sign thing

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,640
you just do it but the beautiful thing

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,230
about that is that what you're doing

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,960
when you put stuff on github or

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,360
bitbucket or sourceforge or google code

00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,070
or whatever what you're doing there is

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,940
not really contributing to open source

00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,350
all that you're certainly doing that

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,690
what you're actually doing there is

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,790
building a resume how many of you are

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,940
here actually are in charge of hiring

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,680
people anyone okay one or two people if

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,180
you see someone brings in a resume with

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,970
a github account on it are you more

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:17,379
likely to hire them if it has confident

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,519
okay so not if they have a sourceforge

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,809
link on there okay I got you yes that's

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,709
that's that's an excellent point but

00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:25,749
what I'm saying is you should be

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,040
building stuff in your spare time or

00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,899
professionally if you're doing this is a

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,839
freelance put it on github and say this

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,939
is my resume this is my content this is

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,189
20 projects I've worked on so you know

00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,999
that I deliver good code if you don't

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,199
want to build your own stuff from

00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,449
scratch because you know maybe you just

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,169
don't have anything that's really

00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,699
burning that you want to build from

00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,230
scratch and take total ownership of

00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,119
there's a million projects that you use

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,499
every day on a Linux system or Mac or

00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,999
even windows for that matter that are

00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:50,949
open source and you should get involved

00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,239
in those you should submit patches and

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:55,059
say here's something I made better hear

00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:57,790
something I fixed your something I

00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:59,529
optimized and your resume should start

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,119
looking more like here's a project I've

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,750
committed patches to here's the patch

00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:06,659
here's the mailing list thread where I

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,769
where we discussed it and debated it and

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:11,679
negotiated until the patch was in the

00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:13,419
form that it should be to be submitted

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,370
because what you're showing there is not

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,899
only i can write code but i can

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,549
cooperate with others which is very very

00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,839
important because the scary thing about

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,429
freelances for people that are hiring

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,720
them is sometimes they're just not very

00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,459
good at communicating even if they're

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,839
really great workers anyone that's ever

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,750
managed a google summer of code project

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,010
knows this that sometimes you have

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,690
people that you're literally going to

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,480
hand thousands of dollars and they just

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,120
stop replying to email so you know you

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,760
want people to understand that you are

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,019
responsive and responsible and flexible

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,340
to when people say well you're coding

00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,630
standards need to be different being

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,220
sure that you were willing to cooperate

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,080
and make things work better said it's

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,779
being like Mike my code is perfect you

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,419
guys are wrong okay so good do

00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,580
open-source milk your contacts build a

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,380
resume you should be constantly updating

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,789
your resume even if you're not looking

00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,080
for full-time work you should always

00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:00,399
have that resume constantly updated

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,169
every time you do a project for someone

00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:04,929
goes on the resume resume should have a

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,460
nice easy link up a nice easy link that

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:08,889
you can pass around put on business card

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,200
put on you know what an email work you

00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,580
know my website / resume or something

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
like that so people can find the latest

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,250
version very quickly that as it expands

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
with new projects on it that being said

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,340
you should also always be interviewing

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,870
even if you have no intention of taking

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,659
a full time job you should waste the

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,010
time of full-time employers sorry about

00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:28,030
that people that hire that one dude over

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,170
there

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,910
people skills are very very important

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,590
when you're a freelance hacker you

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,730
should always always be interviewing

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,350
because it shows you how to sell

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,300
yourself and if you have a bad interview

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,950
go home that night and think about what

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,510
went wrong did you not know the answer

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,280
to something did you not know the

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,350
interesting and didn't cover it well did

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,820
you fart during the interview you know

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,340
things like that did you forget to wear

00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,200
pants you know is it take notes on these

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,230
things what I'm discovering during this

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,220
talk is the word pants is very funny um

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,500
but you should always be interviewing

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,120
even if you plan to never have a full

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,270
time job again because it keeps your

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,620
people skills polished it keeps it keeps

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,730
you understanding the right way to sell

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,650
yourself because remember as a

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,420
freelancer part a part time you are a

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:15,530
product you're always trying to sell

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,090
yourself to the next employer you know

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,160
you should always try to make a name for

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,050
yourself I put in notes here I put in

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,760
quotes blog you know people still use

00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,350
that term but tweet a lot with

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,910
interesting things don't ever put a

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,350
picture yourself throwing up on Facebook

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,090
because you know people are going to

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,040
look you up if your friends are doing it

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,660
get them to take them down big and get

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,800
new friends because those guys are dicks

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,060
but people will Google you every before

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,140
they hire you and they're gonna do that

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,670
whether you want full time work or

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,740
freelance work but you want to make sure

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,600
that your online persona is the best

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,310
representation of you that you can have

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,690
if they find your Twitter stream it

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,640
should be full of interesting technical

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,800
jargon you know jargons the wrong word

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,780
interesting technical thoughts you know

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:59,360
if you want use jargon this guy likes it

00:19:53,780 --> 00:20:01,160
so but um you don't you don't want

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,680
people to see your persona of you as you

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,180
were in undergrad or high school you

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,220
want to look at you want to look like a

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,770
professional if that means hiding your

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,090
real actual twitter calendar a fake

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,800
handle that doesn't have your real name

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,540
on it give it to your friends that's

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,430
fine party all you want but you really

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,080
should try to build a percent of it on

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:22,910
the internet that says I'm smart I get

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:26,600
things done other than that the basic

00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:28,880
gist is that you hustle you do the

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,040
project and you ship ship it shipping is

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,660
the important part of this equation if

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,340
you can't ship product you can't be a

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,510
freelance if you can't get a project

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,100
done because there's lots of people to

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,050
can there's lots and lots of smart

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,760
people that get obsessed over the

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,230
technical details are building the best

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,000
work and abstraction and they never

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,260
actually get the project running those

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,850
people are not good freelancers they're

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,250
not good employees either for what it's

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,600
worth but shipping is God the only thing

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,120
that matters is whether you ship the

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,320
project and you ship it on time if you

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,400
can't do that if you can't build a

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,810
history of doing that you shouldn't be a

00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,160
freelance because word will get around

00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,990
you they shouldn't you should be worked

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,240
with but other than that that's

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,630
basically it keep hustling keep working

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,980
always ship it's that simple okay good

00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,200
that's the end of the talk that has

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,120
structure if that sound like it ahead

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,610
structure at all the rest of this is

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,980
just random advice I'm going to talk

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,390
about this in that in depth and we can

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,860
see if any of its useful if they want to

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,670
say questions yell at me and we'll do a

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:25,100
formal Q&A at the end of this ok first

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:28,070
off always be learning it's the sign of

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,240
an amateur programmer if they ask people

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,620
or they can tell people have to top

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,750
their head how many programming

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,280
languages do you know it's the wrong

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,810
question to ask it demonstrates

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,400
immediately that's the wrong answer to

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,170
give to it demonstrates immediately that

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,760
you don't really know that much you know

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,310
people say well how many programs you

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,440
know I know see I know pearl and the

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,780
Java okay you're fired you know or

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,220
you're not hired in the first place the

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,660
enlightened programmer knows immediately

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,770
that doesn't matter how many programming

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,020
languages you know because they're all

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,090
basically the same when it comes down to

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,760
it what you're learning once you know

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,440
how to program generally all you have to

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,390
do is pick up the book learning perl in

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,890
24 hours find out what the syntax is

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,570
like find out what the quirks are our of

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,490
the language that make it unique and 24

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,110
hours later you're a programmer the I

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,710
wish you luck with that but you know

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,970
your Python programmer you know whatever

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,270
like that pick your favorite language

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,010
and it's amazing that C and C++ has

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,720
lasted as long as it has and you know

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,160
Java is last as long as it has and stuff

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,740
but these languages will all go away

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,990
java will not be the primary thing for

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,110
ever even though google uses it almost

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,640
exclusively which is horrifying and perl

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,710
and python and whatever the next big

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,360
thing is ruby got popular for a little

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,870
while there they will come and they will

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,210
go you don't really want to get stuck as

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,440
specialized on one language you always

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,350
want to be learning if you don't know

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,490
anything about how TCP packets go over

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,900
the internet you should probably google

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,610
it tonight it doesn't matter if you're

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,560
going to actually work at the TCP level

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,300
you might only be working at the Apache

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,310
level where Apache is handling all that

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
stuff and you just care about

00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,310
dream of bites that you're sending but

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,380
you should still understand how it works

00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:06,100
if you don't know assembly language take

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:08,040
a few years and learn it you will never

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,970
use assembly language in modern life

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,890
theoretically unless you are really

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,680
lucky or really unlucky depending on how

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,760
you look at it but you should understand

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,780
how the machine works at a lower level

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,520
and you should understand how you know

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,390
USB sends packets over the bus and stuff

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
like that and I don't know I've never

00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,710
had to know how USB sends over the bus

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,680
but it's the more you know the more you

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:32,200
find that you can apply designs that

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,420
worked well in one way to designs that

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,950
work well in your own software and just

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,200
being a know-it-all is incredibly

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,640
valuable even if you don't need to know

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,900
specifically how some technology works

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,630
you should always be intellectually

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,010
curious people notice that too they are

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,300
people can tell who's intellectually

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,070
curious on who is excited about

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,040
technology even if it's not technology

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,850
they need for the job tomorrow and you

00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,800
never know when you're going to need it

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,550
I got a chiro ting in a language called

00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,100
Lua which I love is a great language I

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,390
wrote a piece of software in that as

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,830
opposed to just a couple of small little

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,690
scriptures what lure usually ends up

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,280
getting used for and I got a call from a

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,230
recruiter out of nowhere saying hey we

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,660
know she did some Lewis stuff and nobody

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,850
writes Lewis software of any size so you

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,080
know I just one day picked up a book on

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,720
Lou I said this is pretty freaking cool

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,250
and Lou is not my full-time job I don't

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,770
really spend a lot of time writing Lua

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,060
code but that opportunity was close to

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,530
me until one day I just got

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,330
intellectually curious about it so you

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,430
should always be learning always find

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,080
something interesting to do in your

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:32,650
field that you wouldn't ever think of

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,570
being it curious about otherwise ok keep

00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,490
good records this is very very important

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,650
if there's ever a discrepancy if there's

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,600
ever a disagreement as a as a contractor

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,970
as a freelance you will the burden of

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,190
proof will be on you if people say that

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,960
you said you would have this done on the

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,340
fifth and you thought was suppose to be

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,660
done on the fifteenth they're going to

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,160
make sure you're going to be the one

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,690
that forwards the email that says we

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,610
want this on the fifteenth if you're

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,740
wrong you're wrong if you can't prove it

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,630
you're wrong so always keep good records

00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,810
don't throw away email if you don't have

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,730
to always keep scans of contracts always

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,610
keep scans of contracts always always

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,630
keep every document you can keep backup

00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,340
system too if you don't

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,510
one there's always somebody that doesn't

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,250
have backups and you're either going to

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,500
lose photos of your kid or you're going

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,000
to lose scans of documents you need for

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,000
your business always keep good backups

00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:25,360
relationships are expensive go ahead and

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,070
here's married oh wow a lot of you great

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,370
you have an uphill struggle as a

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:33,940
freelancer because wives husbands

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,530
children relationships dating these

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,640
things are very expensive and especially

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,050
when you're starting out and you don't

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,370
have a lot of income it could be an

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,110
enormous drain on your time and your

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,310
money I'm not saying we shouldn't have

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:46,510
relationships just be aware that it's a

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,130
bit more uphill when you have to say

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,020
well I would like to do this but you

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,040
know I have to I have a kid now or i'd

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,310
like to do this but I'm getting married

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,960
in six months these things can kill the

00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,720
king kill a freelance dead so you just

00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,550
want to be careful to know that what

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,110
you're getting into and understand that

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,640
you have to budget carefully and more

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,390
carefully if you have other people

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,370
relying on you that being said always

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,230
ask for more than the job is worth this

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,390
is the get this is the best advice I can

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,660
ever give someone starting out doing

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,880
anything as a freelance developer

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,290
everyone screws this up and some people

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,360
screw it up for many years before they

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,440
get it right when you're first starting

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,940
out you don't think you're worth

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,070
anything which is a bad way to think

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,210
about it because it affects everything

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,470
you do in your day it affects the way

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,300
you look at yourself in the mirror in

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,570
the morning but you always always always

00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:38,320
want to thank okay this person wants me

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,090
to you know build an entire web server

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,070
from scratch and I don't mean like put

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,200
together an Apache box I mean like right

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,970
an HTTP server and they want me to make

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,890
sure it can handle dynamic languages and

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,420
does firewalling and I think I can do

00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,250
that in a week for like you know twenty

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,890
bucks don't do that don't be that guy

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,360
but everyone does that cuz i think 1 i'm

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,350
not worth very much which is a fatal way

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,880
to think because you're probably worth

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,010
way more than you think you are and two

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,930
they think that people won't pay what

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,250
they asked for and everyone that's a

00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,400
freelance or has ever been a freelance

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,650
falls into this specific category where

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,420
they think i'm going to ask for i think

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,160
this job is worth five thousand dollars

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,210
so I'm going to ask for two thousand

00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,290
dollars because if I ask for three

00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,060
thousand dollars they'll probably does

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,680
not return my email which is the wrong

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,140
way to think about it I've never in my

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,240
life had a

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,890
asian with a company that one to

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,180
contract me where I asked for money and

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,370
they said it's too much and we're

00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,750
leaving they never do that I've had

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,100
people say that's too much and then we

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,650
negotiate down there's always a

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,570
negotiation involved that's good that's

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,340
fun that's part of the game but don't

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,840
don't think that there's ever going to

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,400
be a chance where you say I want a

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,470
million dollars and they go we're just

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,260
leaving well okay maybe for a million

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,060
but you know it's there will always be a

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,530
chance to go up and go down and don't

00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:51,240
don't undersell yourself because it will

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,860
never go up if you um if you ask for

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,060
3,000 you think it's worth 5,000 you

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,220
can't come back later say wait wait four

00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,930
thousand i'm at 4,000 you you always

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,020
always want to think what you would do

00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,920
them thing for double that and see if

00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,360
they'll give you the money and they

00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,590
might laugh my god I was too much okay

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,300
then you start working down slowly from

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,190
there until you find some way that you

00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,660
both agreed the price is good you need

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,520
to have a minimum price you'll do a job

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,720
for and this price will change it

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,910
changes on what you think you're worth

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,010
hourly if you if you were to think of it

00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,890
that way but it also in terms of I've

00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,480
done jobs for a hundred bucks that were

00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,430
probably worth 10,000 because the thing

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,540
was so interesting and it's like I just

00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,190
want to do this job because it's cool

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,370
you're allowed to do that if you want to

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,930
and you can afford it which no not I I

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,700
couldn't always afford it i still can't

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,420
always afford it days go by where i can

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,310
but but you should have a minimum price

00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,170
in mind such as i'm just going to use

00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,420
the number ten thousand here okay I can

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,190
do this job but not for less than 10,000

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,510
so I'm going to ask for 20,000 and they

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,940
come insane and we're thinking more like

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,950
9000 you walk you're done sorry if you

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,830
can't do it for 10 shitty work is not

00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,150
better than no work if you can't get the

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,410
price you want for it then you're just

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,820
going to be work doing this job going

00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,020
i'm miserable doing it I don't know why

00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,640
I signed up for it I'm committed to

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,680
something that I just want to walk away

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,710
from so if you can't get the money you

00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:09,420
want don't take the job right from the

00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,500
start so always overestimate the

00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,840
schedule i mentioned this briefly a

00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,250
second ago everyone screws this up when

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,110
they start out everyone thinks that the

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,340
ultra hacker and some if you are the

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,960
ultra hacker they even ultra hackers

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,370
have to sleep sometimes and you know

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,170
someone says well we want you to build

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,820
that web server with the PHP integration

00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,380
and blah blah blah blah and you go I can

00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,970
do that in a week no you can't you

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,800
cannot do it in a week and if you can do

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,720
in a week you can't do it well in a week

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,100
you do not want to be taking jobs where

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,260
you crack open

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,240
24 case of coca-cola spend all night on

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,919
it crash for three hours and then start

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,750
over it is not a healthy way to live in

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,110
general it's not good for your health

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,370
it's not good for your mental state and

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,559
more importantly sooner or later you're

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,090
going to fail if you do that you always

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,950
want to overestimate the schedule by a

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,179
large margin if you think you can do in

00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,590
a week you're probably wrong if you

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,510
think you can realistically do it in a

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,799
month tell them two months if they say

00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,080
they in a month and a half okay you can

00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:00,419
work from there the same principle is

00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,190
negotiating for money but you never ever

00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,450
want to say you can do it faster than

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,890
you think you can do it it doesn't

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,650
matter how optimistic you are it doesn't

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,179
matter how great you think you are you

00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,919
don't want to miss deadlines ever and

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,419
everyone I guarantee you will screw this

00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,919
up at some point in their life even if

00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:15,600
you work for a full-time place you know

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,919
this dude will come to you and be like

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,240
can you do this yeah I could do that a

00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,250
week and then like three weeks later

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,380
you're like I'm like close to done yet

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,030
and then you have to deal with that guy

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,340
but you know that guy could be on the

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:30,960
other end of an email to go you always

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,760
want to take the schedule and double

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,860
what you think it will take in the worst

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,450
case scenario it takes as long as you

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,190
said it would and everyone's happy in

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,539
the best case scenario it takes half

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,470
that time and you deliver in half the

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,400
time and they're like this guy's great

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,750
we're definitely gonna work with him

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,909
again he said take two months it took

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,159
two weeks we love them always

00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:49,710
overestimate the schedule I'm not saying

00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,480
you should lie to people but you don't

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,289
want your youth and enthusiasm to get in

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,820
the way of your success I already said a

00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:58,230
shitty work is not better than no work

00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,360
you should fire your customers if they

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,919
suck that's that sounds like a strange

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,020
thing to say but everyone that's ever

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,309
done freelance work you know how to free

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,289
a full time job where you work with

00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:09,090
external companies you build things for

00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:11,370
other companies there's always just that

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,950
toxic poisonous relationship there's

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:16,440
some company that you know doesn't

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,179
respond well keeps asking for more stuff

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,710
keeps complaining that you're charging

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,780
too much whether you're charging too

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,130
much or not the people that you bend

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,169
over backwards for and they just keep

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,299
making your life miserable over and over

00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:29,070
and over again fire them you're done

00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,210
break the contract try to always make

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,309
sure your contract has something says

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,350
you can walk away with 30 days notice or

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,789
something like that whatever but you

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,659
don't want to keep working for someone

00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:38,940
that's making your life miserable

00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,049
because you get up in the morn you go I

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,929
don't want to do this anymore this is

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:46,730
just not fun for me so fire those people

00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:49,200
immediately along those lines there's a

00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,990
people that won't pay you this is always

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,840
a concern with freelancers never ever

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,669
give a free and give a company the idea

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,899
that you're running out of money and all

00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:58,980
those a freelance there may be many

00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,799
times where you're running out of money

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,419
but people will not pay you because you

00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,649
give them a sob story what you want to

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,090
give them as addressed and aggressive

00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:07,140
story in fact if you want to google for

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,820
this you'll have to forgive me for

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,020
cursing here there's a great video on

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,640
the internet of a talk someone gave

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,140
called you pay me it's great and

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,179
it's also full of curses as you might

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,740
guess from the title but it it's

00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:21,360
required viewing if you're a freelance

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,159
developer because you are going to run

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,870
into people that don't pay you they

00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,169
don't pay you quickly to give you a sob

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:30,570
story they you know try to play on your

00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:31,559
good will you want to watch out for

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,740
these people and you want to be

00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,820
aggressive about getting paid by them

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,990
and you want to make it look like it's

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,630
good you're going to be a problem for

00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,309
them if they don't pay you that being

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,049
said you should always hire a lawyer you

00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:44,640
should have one nearby I'm not you know

00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:48,090
you shouldn't have one full-time or

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,200
anything like that but we'll shipley

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,659
gave a talk to a bunch of college

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,919
students at WWDC a few years ago and so

00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,809
I'm stealing this information from him

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,860
and I think it's really good advice you

00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,090
should have a lawyer that you're willing

00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,220
to pay a hundred dollars an hour and

00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,049
hope that you never need him but sooner

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,429
or later you will get sued everyone gets

00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:04,020
sued it's just part of doing business

00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:05,130
sometimes it doesn't mean you did

00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,690
anything wrong it doesn't mean you're

00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,860
going to lose it doesn't mean that

00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,120
you're like semen going to be miserable

00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,559
but you need to be able to call a lawyer

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,640
and say I got a hundred bucks here can I

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,250
talk to you for an hour and see what's

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,690
going on that's important also you want

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,809
that lawyer to be able to send letters

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,149
to people that don't pay you and say you

00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,890
know you owe my client money this is a

00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:24,210
letter from a lawyer let's just keep it

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,679
the letter from a lawyer so in a

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,309
courtroom and then usually get a check

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,830
very quickly so and the thing is this

00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:33,330
isn't nobody likes lawsuits and everyone

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,120
thinks that Seinfeld episode with the

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,669
hot coffee and it doesn't have to be

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,470
that way lawyers don't have to be a

00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:41,789
weapon that you wield and they're not

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,049
even someone that you have to talk to

00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:45,299
you very often because frankly go out of

00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:47,640
my way to not associate with lawyers but

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,370
you should expect to be able to use them

00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,600
at least as a form of defense when you

00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,029
need to and not be embarrassed about

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,380
that not feel overwhelmed by that just

00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:56,610
understand that that's the system it

00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,060
works that way it's just business in

00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,020
America or maybe business everywhere

00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,400
along with your lawyer you should have

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,510
an accountant I also have something on

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,660
here you should also have a therapist

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:08,070
but that's optional although frankly

00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,460
everyone benefits from therapy if you

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,170
want my opinion you wanted an accountant

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,490
the less time you spend thinking about

00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,020
money and someone else pins thinking

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:20,460
about it for you the happier you're

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,590
going to be as a freelance developer you

00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,000
don't want to pay you if you start

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,680
having some success you want to talk to

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,890
a financial advisor to they're out there

00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,360
go to a bank go to some sort of you know

00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,700
credit institution or financial

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,930
institution and schedule an hour to talk

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,010
to somebody say okay I'm making some

00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,420
money at this I'm having a little bit of

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,070
success where should I be putting my

00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,020
money should I be putting it into this

00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,250
because there's no 401k plan for you by

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,870
default like you might get at a

00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,100
full-time employer so you need to be a

00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,440
little bit you need to be thinking about

00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,180
you know where your money can go and not

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,410
just how you're going to buy pizza this

00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,580
week or how you're going to make rent

00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,190
this week you need to be thinking about

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,240
how I'm going to retire some day you

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,260
know these are important things and you

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,220
should talk to a professional about it

00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,780
don't let to spend your whole life

00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,920
talking to accountants the less you talk

00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,050
to accounts the happier you're going to

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,700
be but you know schedule an hour to talk

00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,930
to one see what's involved make sure

00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,640
someone else is filing your taxes

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,660
because miserable and you know they'll

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,290
go through it very quickly you just

00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,510
Hanuma box or receipts and call it a day

00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,620
along those lines in terms of taxes by

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,940
default your what's called a sole

00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,930
proprietorship if you because there's

00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,250
three things you can be a sole

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,970
proprietorship you can be a limited

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:26,670
liability company and LLC if you will or

00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,350
you can be a corporation by default your

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,520
sole proprietorship but what you have to

00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,110
do to become a sole proprietorship is

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,760
just stand imma go I am a sole

00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,970
proprietorship that's it there's no

00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,810
paperwork you don't do anything you just

00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,980
start doing your work you start

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,680
collecting money that's all there is to

00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,260
it I would say this is not necessarily a

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,250
good thing for you to be by default what

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,270
you probably want to do is spend a

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,800
little time filling out the paperwork

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,680
and become a limited liability company

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,150
in LLC which basically says that you're

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,650
doing more or less the same thing but if

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,910
someone Sue's you they can't go after

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,520
your personal assets they can only go

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,480
after company assets corporations also

00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,610
give you that but there's an enormous

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,050
amount of paperwork in corporations and

00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,340
you have to have a shareholder meeting

00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,580
where it's just you bringing doughnuts

00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:08,180
for you to eat

00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:10,940
you don't corporations for individuals

00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,460
are probably overkill you can do it it

00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,350
brings a lot of paperwork it brings a

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,000
lot of regulations it's just not worth

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,100
it most people probably want to in for

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,780
an LLC and you can do this very quickly

00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,610
you go to I guess you probably go to

00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,100
like LegalZoom com or something you fill

00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,390
out the paperwork and it's not hard it

00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,480
can get you can get set up like that

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,470
very quickly you do want some protection

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,640
though in case someone decides to sue

00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,720
you never let someone not pay you I

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,460
already said that I'm going to skip that

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,430
but seriously never let anyone not pay

00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,020
you it's very easy for people to quietly

00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,970
not pay you and you need to stay on top

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,290
of them for that a lot of people as

00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,760
freelances think that they don't have

00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,530
any rights they think that they you know

00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,910
are working by the grace of God and

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,230
that's not a healthy way to think about

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:53,210
it you want to think of yourself as a

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,010
professional with a service the people

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,270
require and if they're not going to pay

00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,260
you you're wasting your time with these

00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,170
people because there's other people that

00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,550
will pay you and it comes down again to

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,020
self esteem and you absolutely need to

00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,160
make sure that you can think highly

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,360
enough of yourself if you don't think

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,290
highly enough yourself you shouldn't be

00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,540
doing this never work on a verbal

00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,630
contract people make this mistake all

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,830
the time and this includes working for

00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,880
your friends and family which by the way

00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,110
I should have written as a bullet point

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,540
here never work for your friends and

00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:23,780
family but seriously never do it it's

00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:29,480
miserable because they're kind of like

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:33,680
this guy but less professional they

00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,450
promptly dress better though if you work

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,040
on a verbal contract and people will do

00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,660
this to you as companies and they do it

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,920
perfectly innocently they'll be like hey

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,630
keya get started on this project so we

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,740
need it right now we need as fast you

00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,940
can do it we're going to get legal

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,080
involved on Monday and they'll take care

00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,160
of the paperwork well then we'll start

00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,600
working on Monday as soon as their

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,130
signatures on there if you work on a

00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,840
verbal contract you don't get paid you

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,570
have no one to blame but yourself don't

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,650
ever work on a verbal contract until you

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,180
have your signature on saying you have

00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,700
their signature on something no work

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,170
gets done and anyone that won't play

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,760
ball under those terms you should never

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,890
work with you should walk out the door

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,970
immediately because they're not going to

00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,080
pay you they're basically telling you

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,130
right from the start they're not going

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,030
to pay you don't work with these people

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,260
you don't have to have anything big and

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,090
complicated binding you don't have to

00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,860
sign anything in blood or you know

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,750
contribute your firstborn or anything

00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,070
like that but you should um

00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,780
always make sure there's paperwork in

00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,530
place if you're a freelance before very

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,060
long you're going to have a very

00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,160
standard template for contracting work

00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,900
and non-disclosure agreements you don't

00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,550
have to go to a lawyer to write

00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,600
something up every time chances are

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,000
you're going to cut and paste some names

00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,320
and addresses into it and sign the same

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,970
paper over and over again with different

00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,080
people you don't have to think a great

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,360
deal about this once you have it in

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,790
place in fact there's templates on the

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,920
internet if you trust them pay a lawyer

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,390
an hour first time and do it the right

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,680
way if you feel better about that but

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:50,630
always always always have paper in place

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,710
get health insurance if you work for a

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,850
full-time employer you might have

00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,710
benefits you might have health insurance

00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:56,030
if you work for yourself the only health

00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,330
insurance you have is the self you pay

00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,740
for yourself you always always always

00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,380
want to have it even if it's the bare

00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,880
minimum that you can have even if you're

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,810
incredibly healthy you never know when

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,250
you're going to be in the emergency room

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,590
and one trip to the emergency room can

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:12,110
bankrupt you so you can go into an

00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,730
emergency room because of any number of

00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,470
things the doctor can look at you and

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,080
not touch you and charge you a thousand

00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,280
dollars and then you go okay I pay that

00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,420
thousand dollars in two weeks later or

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,710
three hundred dollar bill shows up and

00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,510
you don't know what that's for and this

00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,710
will happen over and over again you want

00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,480
the insurance company to take care of

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,740
that you want to make sure that you pay

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,520
them a little bit of money so that if

00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,590
there's a lot of money to be paid

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,850
somebody else pays it and you don't have

00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,730
to deal with that over and over again

00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,750
it's really very scary if you don't have

00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,280
a job you should get health insurance

00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,220
for yourself anyway whether you're a

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,140
freelancer you're just unemployed you

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,310
know maybe someday we'll have a public

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,990
option like the rest of the first world

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:49,040
but right now you absolutely need to be

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,870
paying for this let's see get a nice

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,460
chair and monitor this is very important

00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,960
if you're going to sit somewhere for 15

00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:58,040
hours a day you want the nicest ass

00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:02,240
platform you can get go out and this is

00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,210

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,620
desk all day go out and get the aeron

00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,030
chair it's an expensive chair and your

00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:15,230
butt will never feel better the chair

00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,030
never wears out I've had one since 2001

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,950
and it's the exact same chair it looks

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,580
brand new it just and I sit in it all

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,380
the time constantly for over a decade

00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,540
it's it's good for your back it's got

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,530
lumbar support you don't again Aaron you

00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,000
can get whatever you want this is just

00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,990
the example cuz the chair I have but

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:36,440
you don't look how do you spell it AE ro

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:39,500
n erin herman miller's the company that

00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,730
makes them you can find them used on

00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,750
ebay and even use they probably look

00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,170
brand new extent things are basically

00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,970
indestructible as an awful side note

00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:52,850
also there the seat is mesh so if you

00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:56,690
fart it doesn't linger also another

00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:59,030
benefit of working from home was I going

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,590
to say I don't know you want it so you

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,910
want to take care of your back and your

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,170
butt and you want to take care of your

00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,000
eyes so you want to go up and get the

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,530
most expensive monitor you can these are

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,240
the two things you spend a lot of money

00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,100
on up front go out and get the apple

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,860
cinema display or the dell 30-inch mod

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,270
or whatever and the prices on these have

00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,680
come down recently they used to be like

00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,240
you're paying three thousand dollars for

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,740
a modern now you're paying depending on

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,480
what you want a couple hundred to a

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,190
couple to a thousand somewhere in that

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,260
range and it's a big amount of money to

00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,000
put out initially especially if you're

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,350
just starting out but it's worth doing

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,910
especially you're going to spend that

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,790
much time doing it because if you're

00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,200
working on like a crappy old CRT monitor

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,790
god forbid or something like that

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,320
eventually you start to feel that you

00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,110
start to get eyestrain and you find that

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,910
you can't work well in any conditions

00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,180
you want to take care of yourself over

00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,530
time you know you want to watch out for

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,360
things like repetitive stress injury and

00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,650
stuff like that that's true in any job

00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,890
but definitely true here because

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:54,680
nobody's watching out for you but you

00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:57,500
but that being said you don't need to

00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,030
have this lavish calm lifestyle we all

00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,920
remember from the late 90s or if you

00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,420
don't remember it then you don't want it

00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,710
just take my word for it you know you

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,810
don't want to spend ten thousand dollars

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,300
on a table that's encrusted with

00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,710
diamonds that you bought wholesale from

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,870
Kanye West's house or something like

00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,100
that you you want to have a folding

00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,480
table that you bought from office depot

00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,860
for ten dollars and a

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,840
two-thousand-dollar chair that's

00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,870
basically the method we're looking for

00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,740
here you want take care of yourself

00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,670
you're not looking for a lavish

00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,350
lifestyle you just wanna make sure that

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:28,790
you're taking care of yourself it's very

00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:33,740
important get an office and I have

00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:35,240
office in air quotes here the what you

00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,830
want to do more than anything is if you

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,060
can work from home that's great but even

00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,020
if you work from home you need to get

00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,520
out of the house because you're going to

00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,860
go you're going to cabin fever you're

00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,240
going to drive yourself nuts

00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,560
what you want to do is this you want to

00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,420
have an office and when I say an office

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,010
you never want to rent office space your

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:53,080
office is now called starbucks go to

00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,580
some place go a coffee shop or a bagel

00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,380
shop or something like that that has

00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,300
Wi-Fi and they don't really care if you

00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,550
sit there my personal scam is there's a

00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,310
on the East Coast there's a bagel

00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:05,050
company called bruegger's there's a

00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,790
couple of them in Charlotte even they

00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,370
will sell you what they call a

00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,630
bottomless coffee mug for $150 you can

00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,520
drink as much coffee as you want for

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,920
free there well for free after one

00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,330
hundred fifty dollars but I considered

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,660
that my rent on an office space for

00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:21,460
years one hundred fifty dollars so you

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,950
find places especially coffee shops in

00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,630
bagel shops there generally empty during

00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,160
working hours because everyone else is

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,430
at an office being miserable and wearing

00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,040
pants you can go to this place you won't

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,330
be bothered for the most part you'll

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,860
have free internet access because they

00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:39,640
all have Wi-Fi now you'll have all the

00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,140
coffee you can drink and you get out of

00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,820
the house it gives you a chance to get

00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,680
to a different perspective and a

00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,330
different environment so that you can

00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,940
get some fresh air every now and then

00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:53,230
and some bad coffee but but that there

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,790
are companies right now that never

00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,200
actually ever had an office space you

00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,090
see a lot and startups now because of

00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,340
what the economy is and I think of

00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:01,810
there's a project called delicious

00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,400
library if you're a Mac user I don't

00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:05,320
know if you've ever heard of it they

00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,050
built that entire thing at a local

00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,670
coffee shop in San Francisco I think it

00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,370
was where was just two guys with laptop

00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,240
sitting around the table and you know

00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,530
buying coffee and since they were in

00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,730
there buying coffee no one cared if they

00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,130
stayed there all day and they wrote a

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,750
million dollar selling product at a

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,810
coffee shop and they never paid rent on

00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,820
an office and neither should you ok so

00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,170
I'm wrapping this up here I have two

00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,080
more notes where you stick it out is

00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,130
this note if you find it's not working

00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,840
because it's never working when you

00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,610
first start if you find it's not working

00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,220
you have to stick it out you can't give

00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:38,590
up too soon because hard work and

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:41,880
perseverance will eventually turn things

00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:44,350
around in most cases so you should just

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,990
do your best to not give up and keep

00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,280
trying that being said if you try long

00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,350
enough it's not working you should be

00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,850
smart enough to know when it's time to

00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,440
bounce out of there and go get a real

00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,780
job

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,790
if you've been working at it for 12

00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,050
months and it's not working out and

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,940
you've exhausted your savings and you're

00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,609
running up your credit cards and there's

00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,160
no work on the horizon it's time to go

00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:07,540
back to the workforce and say this

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,130
didn't work now maybe I'll try it later

00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,839
but you do not want to get into a

00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,490
situation where you've run up all your

00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:13,960
credit cards you have no credit no

00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,390
liquidity no money in your bank account

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,819
no parents you can steal money from

00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,960
their purse from you don't want to get

00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,450
into that situation because you're

00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,710
chasing an impossible dream now there's

00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,910
other options you can modify your

00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,579
impossible dream to be less impossible

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:29,740
you can you know find other clients you

00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:31,420
can take a different tact that's part of

00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,589
sticking it out but eventually you want

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,150
to also make sure that if you can't

00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:37,420
stick it out you want to make sure that

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,369
you don't ruin yourself and again that

00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,900
comes back to whether you want to have a

00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:42,250
boring job or a normal job at that point

00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:52,180
you should be looking for an interesting

00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:53,710
job and not yes um yes would be it would

00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,270
be a good idea to start freelancing on

00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,980
the side that depends on your employer

00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,910
it depends on what you're doing the

00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,619
problem with this talk is that

00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,060
everybody's unique and every situation

00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:03,339
is unique I would say yes it's a good

00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,660
idea if you can pull it off and again

00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:06,010
you also to balance things like you know

00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,810
does my wife want me to come home for

00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,060
dinner you know and stuff like that or

00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,230
you know I do the kids want me to play

00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,609
with them when I need to be upstairs

00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:15,160
working because this is my second

00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:16,420
full-time job if you can pull it off or

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,440
you can start small you get a small

00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,420
contract doing something you love

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,800
definitely do that because there's no

00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,470
sense in giving up the safety net if you

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,470
don't have to in fact if your company is

00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,730
okay with it and you never have to give

00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,990
up your full-time job and you like it

00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,190
you can make money on the side there's

00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,810
no reason yet to be full-time at this

00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,880
either you know you can do what you like

00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:36,910
I got one more point I'm going to take

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,050
questions which is what I was just

00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:41,500
talking about here my last point I just

00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:44,410
wrote down balance ! workplace leap in

00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,200
love do not find yourself doing any of

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:48,790
these things too much you want to find

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,790
you go to work whatever your work maybe

00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:53,710
and then you come home and you have some

00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,540
fun or you know you want to find that

00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,710
you get enough hours of sleep at night

00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,900
that you're not waking up in the morning

00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:01,420
going why am I doing this and you know I

00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,180
in a former life I was trained to be an

00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,410
English high school English teacher many

00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,960
many years ago

00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,340
and there are some mornings where I look

00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,270
at myself in the mirror some nights I

00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,010
don't get up in the morning if I don't

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,420
have to there's there's some days where

00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:15,010
I get up and I look in the mirror and I

00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,510
go why am I not teaching English why am

00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,060
I doing this instead because all my

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:21,810
customers are jerks and you know the

00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,280
money's not coming in and then you know

00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,240
if you find there will be days like that

00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,650
there's always gonna be days like that

00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,120
you might find next month you're making

00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,260
tons of money and that you've got a new

00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,420
batch of customers and they're much more

00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,070
fun and you know the work is interesting

00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,660
and you're solving problems that no one

00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,220
else is solving and you're the hero

00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,930
every day and those are good feelings

00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,160
you want those feelings but if every day

00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,570
you're waking up and you're going i just

00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,480
don't like this you got to get out of it

00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:45,580
you know but don't work too much don't

00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,990
play too much it's very easy to turn on

00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,580
the television and start watching I

00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,350
don't know Oprah in the middle of the

00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,430
day and then you know by the time judge

00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,390
judy is over you like oh I should've

00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,830
been working for the last three hours

00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:56,850
you know you don't want to get stuck

00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:59,410
trying to beat that last level on I

00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,540
don't know the Nintendo Wii game you're

00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,500
playing instead of working you want to

00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,220
make sure you sleep enough if you don't

00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,650
sleep enough you're going to be

00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,820
miserable and you don't want to and I

00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,930
wrote down love is this last thing you

00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,280
don't want to ruin your relationships

00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,370
you want to try and find the balance

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,780
between those four things you know

00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:15,100
workplace leap and love if you find that

00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,690
balance you're going to be successful no

00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,130
matter what you do alright so that's my

00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,920
talk I got a couple minutes for

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,970
questions anybody have any questions I

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:27,660
saw hands go up earlier I don't know a

00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:27,660
dice scary went off anyone yeah go ahead

00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:41,910
yes is it a good are you asking oh um he

00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:44,670
has to what I think about Kickstarter

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,410
which is a website for you say I want

00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,239
money people give you donations you tell

00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,019
them what you know you're this project

00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,239
you're going to build there's been some

00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,769
very successful ones in terms of video

00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,959
games Double Fine which is the company

00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:56,459
that did psychonauts which you can buy

00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:58,439
by the way Humble Bundle calm this week

00:48:56,459 --> 00:49:01,890
if you haven't gotten your copy of that

00:48:58,439 --> 00:49:03,269
yet for linux and mac OS they went on

00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,869
there and said we want to build a new

00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:08,519
game we have this great pedigree of of

00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:10,079
game developers and some of the greatest

00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,459
minds and adventure games we want to

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,660
build this game it's going to cost us I

00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:15,180
don't figure with our original number

00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,829
was it was like a million dollars and by

00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,239
the time that this period where people

00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:20,999
could contribute to their kickstarter

00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:24,299
project ended they had 3.5 million

00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:26,969
dollars sitting there jason scott who

00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:30,930
does text files calm did the the BBS

00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:32,849
documentary did the the the documentary

00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:36,390
on infocom the get lamp of documentary

00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:38,519
the guy who saved geo cities when ya who

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,709
was going to pull the plug on it that

00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:42,269
guy said i want to work for six months I

00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:43,469
need this much money to do it these are

00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:47,009
the projects I will complete in that

00:49:43,469 --> 00:49:48,660
time and he got the money you know so it

00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:50,039
I don't think it's going to work for

00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,989
everyone if what you're saying is I want

00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:55,499
to be a freelance developer and I'm

00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:57,869
gonna go do some cool open source stuff

00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:59,429
and generically and until I get off the

00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,019
ground i would like Kickstarter to

00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,249
finance it I think it's actually against

00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:05,279
the rules they won't let you run that

00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:07,140
Kickstarter that being said if you want

00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:09,539
to run one say I'm going to build this

00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,859
specific project and it will take this

00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,599
much time in this much money that's

00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,759
exactly what Kickstarter's for and it's

00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:16,380
a great way to get started to the danger

00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:17,519
is that that's no different anything

00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,039
else that's hustling and marketing if

00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,479
you don't have I'm thinking who here in

00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:24,539
the 80s played a video game called space

00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:27,660
quest I wish more hands went up that

00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:29,009
game is awesome i loved it I loved it

00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:33,269
there was a whole series the two guys

00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:34,769
that did that are mark crow I forget

00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:35,759
their names they're on kiss her right

00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,929
now they have two more days left on

00:50:35,759 --> 00:50:38,369
their Kickstarter for half a million

00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:40,890
dollars they want to make another space

00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,029
quest like game for nostalgia and they

00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,319
haven't hit that goal yet they havin hit

00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:44,539
the half

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,769
million-dollar point yet they're like 75

00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:46,759
thousand dollars away from it and

00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:49,579
they're going to run out of time and not

00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:51,259
get the money and theoretically there

00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,779
should be a fan base for that leisure

00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:55,729
suit larry who played that he won my to

00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:57,259
do a remake he got the money so it's all

00:50:55,729 --> 00:50:58,729
about marketing and if you don't have a

00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:01,009
fan base you may not be able to make

00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:02,539
Kickstarter work for you I can't think

00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:05,150
of a random guy that just got the money

00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:08,749
they always had name recognition or they

00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:10,039
always had nostalgia or rabid fans of

00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:12,529
some sort and there's been wild success

00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:13,880
stories on there but it would be a hard

00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:28,219
sell for someone starting out is what

00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:29,269
I'm saying yes well yes it's true he

00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,199
said that there seems to be a difference

00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:31,339
tween freelancing because you're

00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:32,269
building stuff for other people in

00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,380
freelance thinks you're building your

00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:36,499
own stuff you won't be your own boss

00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:39,049
that's absolutely true and the there's a

00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:42,199
danger in that there's um there people

00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:44,119
have had success stories both ways the

00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,319
the problem is that if you're building

00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:47,359
your own thing then you have to sell it

00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:49,039
afterwards which is always awful but

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,469
people have definitely done it it's not

00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,940
what my path has been but it's certainly

00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:54,819
a path that people have done it's just

00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,690
it's just another form of the same thing

00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:58,009
they shouldn't really say how to quit

00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,900
your job that should say how to fire

00:51:58,009 --> 00:52:02,119
your boss and that would be another

00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,650
thing there that being said in my line

00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,449
of work what I've loved best about it is

00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,039
that people pay me to do stuff which may

00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:08,599
or may not be closed source but in

00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,249
building those things I often have to

00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,170
build tools which I then open source I

00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:13,279
say I needed this to get my job done I

00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,839
hope it benefits the rest of the

00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:16,789
internet and i have a whole mercurial

00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:18,140
server full of source code now that has

00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:23,440
helped me and hopefully helped other

00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:23,440
people too any other questions yes

00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,070
the dinner screen being a contractor or

00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:38,120
freelancer consultant I think it's

00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,350
probably a pay scale I don't know it

00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,280
depends on the market to like some

00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,260
people here free lance and they think

00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,700
dirty hippie and you want to watch out

00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,870
for that that's definitely not the

00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:48,980
attitude that you want to give you if

00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:52,490
you are a dirty hippie the so that

00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,540
that's fine generally consultants if you

00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,620
can find someone is looking for a

00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,660
consultant what they're saying is we're

00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,850
going to pay you more for the same job I

00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:01,460
don't usually get those jobs so I

00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,420
wouldn't I hadn't even thought about

00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,970
that until you brought up that's

00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,170

00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:39,200
so okay so any other questions I have

00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,160
like two or three minutes left anyone

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:49,310
else has any other questions they want

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:51,320
to ask anything yes scarier things um I

00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,640
I don't know this whole speech was a

00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,710
whole list of horror stories I don't

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,210
know the things you want to work look

00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,770
out for is people that will screw you

00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,810
because not everyone works on good faith

00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:03,200
and you want to work you want to try to

00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:04,850
avoid being in the hospital ever jokes

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,800
aside you'd never want to go the

00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:08,540
emergency room if you don't have to like

00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,710
I said have health insurance and the

00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,270
type of health insurance you get by the

00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,980
way should depend on how healthy you are

00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,180
look if you're generally healthy get

00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,500
some baseline health insurance just

00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,820
enough that you're not going to be

00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,170
screwed if you end up in the hospital if

00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,220
you have like really bad asthma or

00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,200
something you might want something a

00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,250
little better you know there's lots and

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,450
lots of options out there you should

00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,310
talk to someone there's people that

00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:27,470
don't work specifically for insurance

00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:29,060
companies but can recommend oh you

00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,620
should have blue cross blue shield or

00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,480
you should have this from humana or

00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,740
whatever talk to a professional about it

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,710
don't talk to a sales representative

00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,540
from that

00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,820
see and find a package that works best

00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,170
for you the scariest things for me

00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,849
because I usually work in other people's

00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,920
code bases in you might too also as a

00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:45,300
freelancer the scariest thing is

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,859
thinking you know what's going on and

00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,720
then finding something horrible because

00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:50,849
you might find after carefully

00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,130
evaluating a whole code base that you

00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:56,010
there's one line of c code in the middle

00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:58,290
of it this says call this win32 function

00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,450
that does the entire program and you're

00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,310
now writing the win32 api instead of

00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,020
porting something to linux in my case

00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,310
you know there's a lot of unknowns

00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,780
especially when you work in someone

00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,740
else's code base that you don't know

00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,740
what obstacles you're going to fall over

00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,240
until you literally trip over them and

00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:15,660
you that's the scary thing for me at

00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:20,280
least I don't have yes I'm sorry would

00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:22,200
say I do not he asked if I carry errors

00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,060
and omissions insurance I don't know

00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:29,270
much about that maybe I should I don't

00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:32,430
know um I only I have health insurance

00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:33,660
that's about all I have I did most

00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,130
people don't carry general liability

00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,330
insurance you can if you want to it

00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,410
depends on the contracts you're getting

00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,450
if you start getting the things that are

00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,760
like big name high money stuff we're

00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,080
like if you fail you're going to there's

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,640
going to be a lot of problems or people

00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,660
are going to die or something like that

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,339
you definitely wanna get better

00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,990
insurance than this but you know you

00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:56,849
don't want to spend your entire paycheck

00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:58,770
on insurance so yes you should I don't

00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:00,450
I'm very very disorganized as one of the

00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,890
benefits of being a freelance I've

00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,510
experiment with different things Google

00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,400
calendars been what's worked best for me

00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,040
in terms of keeping track of where I've

00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,660
been where I've been spending my time

00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,980
what alerts I alerts the things are

00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,480
coming up to be do I also keep a

00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,040
bugzilla for myself that's just on my

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,780
land that it'll keep bugs and I just

00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,190
keep like things that are still pending

00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,740
so i can start checking them off as

00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,359
assigned or resolved as they've already

00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,490
been done it's a matter of how much

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,500
discipline you want to have less

00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:27,359
discipline eating less discipline is

00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,770
always better but there's lots of

00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,060
different tools out there i found things

00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:34,369
that i don't have to pay attention to a

00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:34,369
lot of the things I like best question

00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,320
they're all they're all important

00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:39,320
questions go ahead

00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,830
yes

00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,500
no oh that's actually a good point yes

00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,940
if I've ever found something so

00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,970
ridiculous that you submit to the daily

00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:01,070
WTF i'm going to recommend that you send

00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:02,780
these things in IM conversations to your

00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,849
friends but you don't ever talk about

00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,650
them publicly it's really really bad

00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:08,060
business like there have been so many

00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,130
times where I've found the most

00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,200
ridiculous bug ever and I want to tweet

00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,520
about it but my employers love the

00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,940
people I work for read my twitter stream

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,200
and they're going to be mad so don't

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:19,640
chuckle about it to yourself and you

00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,700
will find the most ridiculous code in

00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,470
any project you work on but don't don't

00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,710
kiss and tell that's all I'm saying yes

00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:28,730
one more question we have one more

00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:32,030
question but I'm going to ignore this

00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:43,670
guy keep asking no go ahead quick on it

00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:44,690
too quickly that's true well if I can

00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,710
summarize they said don't say anything

00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,880
bad didn't interviews about other

00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,770
companies you work for be professional

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,570
at all times I know that's a really

00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:52,160
simple way to put it but it's harder to

00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,510
do than you think you there's a certain

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,250
amount maturity you need to build as

00:57:53,510 --> 00:58:00,619
time goes on do it as quickly as you can

00:57:55,250 --> 00:58:02,830
any other questions no thank you very

00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:02,830
much

00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,790
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,740
ago we could not have imagined that

00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:24,930
asterisk would not only become the most

00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:27,090
widely adopted open source communication

00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:29,100
software on the planet but that it would

00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:31,620
impact the entire industry in the way

00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,600
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:36,240
way into more than 170 countries and

00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,190
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,290
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,700
transition of power from the hands of

00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,950
the traditional proprietary phone

00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,350
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:48,300
administrators of phone systems using

00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,530
this power our customers have created

00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,480
all sorts of business changing

00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:53,310
applications from small office phone

00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,830
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:57,450
the international carrier networks in

00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,220
fact there's even an entire country

00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,830
those communications of a structure runs

00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,750
on esters the gym has always been about

00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,460
creating technology that expands

00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:07,620
communications capabilities in ways that

00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,820
we could never have imagined and that's

00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,220
part of what's game-changing about

00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:13,920
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:16,020
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,120
IP phones that extends control of the

00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,890
user all the way to the desktop the

00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,600
launch of these new products represents

00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,550
the next phase in de jambes history of

00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,100
innovation these are the first and only

00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:27,810
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,370
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:31,380
our expectations for building a family

00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:33,540
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,280
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,930
the team to build the phones such that

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,120
they were easy to install integrate

00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,950
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,530
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:45,150
that goal user feedback is validating

00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:47,280
that when it comes to operation with

00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:49,710
astro space systems including our own

00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,260
Switchvox based product these are the

00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:53,580
easiest to use best integrated most

00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,160
interoperable products on the market

00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:58,160
today the digitally phones will

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,210
initially include three IP des hommes

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,160
uniquely designed to complement any

01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:04,020
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,690
these phones are different for a number

01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:09,360
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,770
designed for use with esters secondly

01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,380
we've made it really easy to

01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,790
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:16,860
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:18,810
to access information inside of asterisk

01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,420
allowing tight coupling between an

01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:22,380
application and

01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,540
additionally we've created an

01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:26,670
applications engine that allows users

01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:29,910
and developers to create and run their

01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,680
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:33,630
done all of this at a very compelling

01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,310
price point at Digium we're always

01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,410
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:39,990
the best value in business phone systems

01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:41,520
and also give them the power to create

01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,680
their own solutions or any

01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,420
communications challenge will continue

01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,830
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,900
astros cooler faster and more

01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:50,520
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,980
asterisk and what communications even

01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:56,690
easier and together we'll change the way

01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,690
the world communicates again

01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:13,920
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:16,080
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,530
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:23,360
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:26,880
happening in open source the

01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,680
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,780
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,790
these are these you know these these

01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,070
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:37,680
discovered and then fixed is it like

01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:40,380
that really shows the power of the you

01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,030
know of the open source community it is

01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:46,230
global and it's definitely because of

01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:52,560
the users community people are extremely

01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:54,300
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,730
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,870
these guys helping each other out and

01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:00,780
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:02,610
manner the product is transparent for

01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:06,630
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:08,820
base everyone can see how close that is

01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:14,700
is being built nothing nothing is

01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:17,340
proprietary everything is open in many

01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:21,540
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:25,320
ongoing health cloudstack the most

01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:29,180
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,849
was our first developer boot camp

01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:34,520
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:38,480
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:42,650
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:45,470
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:48,020
chairs into the room twice everything

01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:51,349
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:54,319
is open source and so I don't think that

01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:56,089
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:59,119
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:02:56,089 --> 01:03:01,670
computing and so i think it's i think

01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,170
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,309
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:09,859
talking about open source cloud

01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:13,010
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:15,410
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:19,280
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:21,980
each data centers these hardware is

01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,460
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:28,160
to handle number one that mass scale

01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:31,339
number two it's designed to handle the

01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:33,890
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:38,390
deployments we started working on cobb

01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:41,690
deck over four years ago and it was the

01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:43,430
original set of people working on it had

01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:47,540
a background of delivering software

01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:51,799
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:55,400
lots of users actually using it high

01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:58,490
availability is a key feature multiple

01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,650
hypervisors support different network

01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:03,680
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:05,450
better while step management server can

01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:09,140
be deployed in different physical

01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:10,790
machines it definitely has a huge

01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:15,770
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:18,349
there's a major movie studio that they

01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:21,650
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:23,630
to transcode video and i thought that

01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:25,280
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:28,320
more fascinating is what they did during

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:31,050
lunch where they would spin up

01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,220
you know 50 or 60 game servers then as

01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,230
soon as lunch was over they would

01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:38,250
destroy all the instances and go back to

01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:39,690
doing real work CloudStack is vast it

01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,220
touches so many different aspects and

01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:43,410
there's no one person that's kind of

01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:46,890
like a master of all those realms I

01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:49,590
think clouds stack as a project is going

01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:53,390
to be one of the leaders simply because

01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:59,060
it's some of the most feature fallen and

01:04:53,390 --> 01:05:03,290
and robust platforms out they learn I

01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:03,290
