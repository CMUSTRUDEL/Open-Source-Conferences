but I kind of thought who I be here but

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,680
who am I well at my shaman told you but

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,790
I'll tell you here hi i am a senior

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,850
network engineer at a community college

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,100
had been working in education eight

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,470
years nine years something like that i

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,030
started out of k-12 i was here at the

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,030
North Atlantic's best I did a talk this

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,040
is a bottle of up talk to that which

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,250
there will be some not-so-nice truths to

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,170
some of the stuff that I implemented but

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,430
you also may unfortunately know me from

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,560
a little podcast called the Linux

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,150
basement it's still around it I don't do

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,690
any new episodes but there's lots of

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,500
truth look I'm if you're learning drupal

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,120
you may come across my website and we'll

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,470
come back to all those savings that I

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,299
flash up there and did not talk about

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:03,100
don't worry look back to that alright I

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,079
like to walk around but I have to hit

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,060
the button so kind of sauce so we'll see

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:11,260
what happens here I'm here because I

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,900
believe in education that's probably why

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,579
you're here too you know we all educate

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,290
ourselves on a constant basis if you

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,000
don't it's terribly disappointing by I'm

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,650
sure you because you are here at a

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,150
conference that is about linux you

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,939
educate yourselves

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:31,290
so I'm here right I'm our system is

00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:33,730
broken all right so I love it

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,829
educational system in America absolute

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:41,500
shambles there are reasons it's fiscally

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:50,019
bro this is full budget you can see that

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:53,980
okay oh yeah 120 nice day see that's

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:58,049
interesting trending so obviously we're

00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:03,970
not in 2016 yes so these where's trip um

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:06,129
attention if you just look at same for

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:15,449
five years so that's cool down a little

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:19,690
bit but billion dollars net edgy always

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:21,190
trouble interesting enough I just you

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,340
know this product cool numbers here but

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:29,440
just to point out almost a trillion sort

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:35,370
of sense totally cool we we love what's

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:38,050
that this is true no we have this I'm

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,039
completely bias oh no that's totally

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,470
cool i am table so we're good um yeah

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,750
our totally different friend for

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,930
instance in Virginia where I am and k12

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,820
it's a county run system here in North

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,659
Carolina fun system which is really

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,400
weird now you be some state money but

00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,639
control governance over the schools very

00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,639
very

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:12,070
that's problem okay so interesting

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:17,650
Brooks me wrong okay hold anymore that

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:22,570
guy so technologically it's broken

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:25,720
pedigo hey I am an IT but I love to

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,030
study pedagogy you know the how you

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:33,550
actually get someone to learn something

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:35,440
all right so this is a problem last year

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,740
I think you were one of the professor's

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,670
back there who you guys came and you

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,840
were like asking questions not about not

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,340
about how to get linux into the

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,950
classroom you're asking like how do we

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,060
get students interested in the freaking

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,440
class that's that's a pedagogy problem

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,940
okay it's not actually the technology

00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,310
problem but it is of the little act is

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,400
still the problem it's a great book

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:08,980
that's life excuse me the definitely the

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:14,080
Great America can't expect of the

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:19,480
federal education code for 30-some 16

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:24,400
rest now why mentally there are problems

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:28,480
with the school system I wish I could

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,830
just hit enter okay cool thing she's an

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,300
education to keep developing human

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,360
capital we all know this i'm preaching

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,270
that require right it will affect not

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,160
only our economy but also our stood at

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,650
cultural life unfortunately america this

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,240
is part of the problem I mean we know

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,510
right now there are problems in America

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:51,640
and we're not fixing it in the town for

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,100
throwing money at foundation of our

00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,540
society is based in education if you are

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,130
not educating your young peeps

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,290
everything else falls apart down the

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:03,790
road unfortunately however con with that

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,990
very interesting thing she sipped don't

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,070
worry i will actually get a little geeky

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:12,660
later it does happen he was at an

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,660
international cop there

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:33,700
Fon leb re geeks tegnap nothing today

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,670
technology is a cat to education I have

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,070
to have ecology for a good education

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:41,710
it's the truth the only thing that ever

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:46,120
ever is good ever creates better

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:51,670
education is getting to kill from

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:55,480
a terrific information presentable I

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:59,400
mean if you another good book is work

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,660
hard play nice and it's all about how

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,640
the only sustainable schools in America

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,290
right now our charter schools and it's

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,170
very interesting what they do in these

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,390
charter schools and it's completely

00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,090
against the democratic system that we

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:16,120
built around education but these kids

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,540
put on uniforms every day and they go to

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,070
school and they go for longer hours and

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,540
they are disciplined immediately when

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,419
something goes wrong in the classroom

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,960
and these kids are coming out of I'm

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,280
sorry discipline right wing actually

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,229
disciplining our children there's a

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,560
funny comic on the line I'm getting way

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:40,780
out I rathole a lot so this will be fun

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:44,410
the there's a rightly just yeah well

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:48,250
that'll fix right now the there was a

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:51,970
funny comic online a few months ago and

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,590
it had 1950s and there was the parents

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,880
yelling at the student and the teacher

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,610
yelling at the student for doing

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,500
something wrong and then it cut to 2012

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,600
and it was the parents yelling at the

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,000
teacher for something the student dinner

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,960
on which if you're an education really

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,970
kind of hits home funny not funny anyway

00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,490
so yeah very interesting stuff here

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,020
these are the key points and education

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,410
now I will get into the technology side

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,490
but I felt it was important to say up

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,890
here I you know I'm and I've been in IT

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,780
for 15 years now but I don't actually

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,410
think technology fixes the problem I

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:29,440
love open source open source philosophy

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:34,240
can be part of the fix to the problem

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,940
and we'll get into that okay hoorah so

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,029
as I said before I think you can all see

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,800
that yeah it came up pretty good uh yeah

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:46,990
China China China that's interesting

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,579
singapore kicking ass look at them good

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,439
job singapore where's the united states

00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,389
oh actually they didn't have enough

00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:56,439
space on this graphic so we actually had

00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:58,870
to put the number down here 17th in the

00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:01,629
world for reading this is back 2009by

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:08,699
why the new stats aren't out yet 31st

00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:08,699
format nice nice and 23 for science

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:23,319
what's that um no right right right

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:26,139
right we are this is not the way a first

00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:29,800
world country is supposed to work yeah

00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:31,569
so we have problems this is what

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,699
unfortunately this is why some of those

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:35,860
students you can class they're

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:40,089
struggling with math let alone learning

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,399
java but anyway we won't get too much

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,540
into that but yeah it's not that bad

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,189
this is a little doom and gloom I

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:51,189
apologize what can I tell you well it'll

00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:53,230
get happier may be socially broken yes

00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:55,540
yes we are specially broken that's what

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,220
we were just talking about education is

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,189
the next best thing to a record deal

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,050
that's it people what's better than

00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:05,230

mediocre is no longer than norm now that

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,939
sounds harsh right but back in our

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,009
fathers days

00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,389
now you could have a resume in a college

00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,970
degree and walk in and get a job and

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:48,279
work there for 30 years now you have to

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,869
be spectacular I am NOT just a director

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,149
of idea to college i also have a youtube

00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:54,459
channel you can follow me on twitter i

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,709
am all over cuz i'm doing a talk itself

00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:00,009
you can't be mediocre anymore if you get

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:02,379
a great job interesting concept anyway

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,489
highly recommend Seth Godin reading this

00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:08,349
is one of the cool graphics I pulled

00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:09,939
from him and we move on all right and

00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:14,139
why am I here I don't know why I'm here

00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:17,199
okay yes so what did you actually come

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,269
to hear about technology open source all

00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,559
right by the way this is prezi that's

00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,539
the first question I always get when i

00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,769
open the QA this software that I'm

00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:26,019
presenting what is prezi it's awesome

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,689
all right um and its proprietary so you

00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,809
can all throw tomatoes at me or whatever

00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:36,279
all right so open source equals

00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:38,589
education my point is and and this it

00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,479
get cut off a little bit there but my

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,299
point and this is everything we use

00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:46,299
right in your pocket right now has some

00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:50,769
type of open source Linux kernel bsd

00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:54,489
something on it open source was created

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:58,409
in the educational realm everything was

00:12:54,489 --> 00:13:01,709
named an open source project anybody

00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:06,970
don't mess with me take a good one

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:09,669
Firefox is a good one Drupal is one of

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,489
my favorites triple down here this guy i

00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:16,449
talk i do a lot of i do a lot of drupal

00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:17,559
I know I an school I do a lot of Drupal

00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,959
work i'll talk about that more but

00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:22,229
drupal what happened at why was drupal

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,179
creative i was linux created we've

00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:28,619
someone was at college found a need

00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:31,569
filled in all the open source software

00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:33,399
that we know and love today aside from

00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:36,579
chromium although i can make an argument

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,729
that started at a that started at an

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:42,249
education place de was built around a

00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:44,619
need usually based in education I mean

00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,989
open source is part of the education

00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:48,819
paradigm open source was not open source

00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:51,789
when it started in education of course

00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:53,649
that was coined back in the late 90s but

00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,720
the whole philosophy

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,490
is built on education there's some

00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,709
interesting graphics that's actually for

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,959
my presentation than I did last time

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,119
anybody ever used Tomcat anymore at

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,660
least I yeah oh yeah well you're a Java

00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:09,639
junkie yeah alright cool zimbra avenues

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,189
in brain ages I used to run the heck out

00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,499
of some Zimmer email servers though yeah

00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:16,089
cool stuff all right Django still around

00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:18,759
right but have they gotten up to the

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,939
next version of Python yet I don't know

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:29,290
i don't know like python 3 i know i was

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:30,999
a problem all right so around the flus i

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,860
will get to the key stuff i promise but

00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,209
around the philosophy that open source

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,720
was built in education there is now a

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:40,839
huge movement towards opencourseware

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,720
open classes you can learn whatever you

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,759
want now online for free now nobody's

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,809
going to give you credits for it but who

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,179
really cares about that anyway right

00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:51,069
where I to you guys right so we're just

00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:54,040
going for the certs anyway know if you

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:56,860
want to learn about biology tomorrow go

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,370
online and go to these sites and it's

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,439
fantastic do you want to learn about

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,139
computer science go there Carnegie

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:06,910
Mellon has a fantastic site berkeley

00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,100
site is awesome talk about an

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,649
aggregation of wonderful wonderful

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,929
videos that you can just watch a little

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,600
plug here actually i'll get to it I

00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:19,629
almost got to hit myself and of course

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,220
the fat I in my opinion the real founder

00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:22,809
and push towards this was MIT

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,309
OpenCourseWare they've been online the

00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:29,290
longest with a very very robust

00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:30,759
sophisticated system to take courses if

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,899
you're not in education I mean if you're

00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,220
not if you're not interested in the

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,800
credits you just take the course it's

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,629
all up there it's fantastic stuff okay

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:42,699
so well I won't get into too much of

00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:46,389
that but cool stuff just some resources

00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:48,459
right so now is in my plug the success

00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:51,009
with open source that's actually in my

00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:53,170
office at work on one of my bookshelves

00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:56,439
the successive open source is one of my

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,360
favorite books of all time reason I even

00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:00,069
found out about the book is because

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,139
there was this great course at Berkeley

00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:03,069
and I can't find it online anymore so

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,999
you're all going to hate me for even

00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,150
talking about it because now you're

00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:08,360
going to search it you're not good money

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,640
it was this fantastic course a 10-week

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,950
course I started listening to it I went

00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,100
through a lecture Fox selectra Fox is an

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,630
aggregation of OpenCourseWare that you

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,780
can just search find the course you want

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,420
and it's not like an aggregator and it

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,150
was the success of open source the Weber

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,890
is the author he actually works at

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,350
Berkeley now he didn't when this course

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,350
came out and this course was so awesome

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,810
they had the guys I not I'm bad with

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,740
names the guys who found it Apache came

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:43,070
in and talked one week and then they had

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,690
the guy who's um what's that huge online

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:49,100
world map minecraft before minecraft

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,540
it's the virtual world second life they

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,010
had the guy from second life come on and

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,200
talk about the open-source process in

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,200
their business every week they had the

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,630
rock stars of open source show up and do

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,640
these fantastic talks and and you could

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,160
read the book and follow along with the

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,320
course so forget about the course cuz

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,490
you're not funny if you do please let me

00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,839
know because I searched and searched I

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,890
wanted to make sure I put a link up and

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,030
I couldn't find any more it's so

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,390
disappointing it's not about line

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,900
anymore but that book it goes to the

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:21,320
history of Linux it talks about all the

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,990
early educational basis of open source

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:32,120
software fantastic book there's my plug

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:33,440
and a little little interest just just

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,040
one quote from the book and I really

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,720
like this I love meritocracy you know

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,190
paradigms and speaking on the

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,230
meritocracy of open source your rights

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,000
by creating the right to for code the

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,590
open-source process transfers a very

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,650
important source of power from the

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,480
leader to the followers ok that proved

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,730
the privilege that comes with leadership

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,940
then depends on continuous renewal of a

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,380
contingent grant from the community that

00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,380
looks like a complicated sense but that

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,140
is a powerful powerful idea if only

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,880
government worked that way right it is

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,280
meritocracy government should work this

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,110
way to actually grant the power to the

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,620
community would it be great if a

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,480
classroom work that way ok when you

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,430
actually have give power to your

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,660
community to get more involved it's very

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,980
powerful stuff anyway

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,750
ah there we go armored educate oh you

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,080
saw it did anybody see that and we see

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,080
that the colors and education is

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,780
Microsoft driven in the United States so

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,360
we all a lot of us work in perhaps

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,930
schools or our vest have vested interest

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,420
in education hmm i could tell you i

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:44,090
worked for k-12 and now i work for a

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,240
huge college system the virginia

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,580
community college system has the largest

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,620
oracle installation in the world the

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,810
largest blackboard installation in the

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,040
world and say it has a lot to do with

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,300
Northern Virginia and how the whole

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,900
system aggregates everything to a

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,780
central location but I mean Microsoft we

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,440
have licenses at a yin-yang if you go to

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:09,230
school in Virginia you can get a copy of

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,150
windows 7 45 dollars I mean that's it

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,160
right the first hits for free that's it

00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,840
drugs deal has been doing a long time

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,600
Microsoft knows Google's the same way

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,280
when I was in a I was in a talk and

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,630
sorry I know Google I know they're

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,360
giving money to the conference and all I

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:30,830
apologized I'm not talking bad they are

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,540
evil oh but I was just that a google I

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,830
would say it's a talk it was more like a

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,590
sales pitch for google app to knee to

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,730
you I've moved i moved to k12 so i'll

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,560
talk about in a little bit i moved the

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,150
k-12 system then I was over to Google

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,840
Apps and I moved into college now or to

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:48,800
google apps they fully admitted they

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,050
said a question from the audience why is

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,560
it free why is it free for education and

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,180
the woman just grin first it's for free

00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,610
she didn't say that I mean she said

00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,110
because she said because well we're

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,640
giving that to people in education so

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,990
they go on the business world and then

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,700
they're entrepreneurs and they already

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,050
use our product and they want the

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,520
product and then they go to the business

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,490
side and at pay fifty dollars per user

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,350
not a lot of money but wow I mean that's

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:16,270
Google admits it first hits for free

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:18,590
okay same thing Microsoft is everywhere

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,750
unfortunately this presentation will not

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,720
have a lot on how to get linux on the

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,720
desktop and education and that's why I

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,860
have this organ that you know it's very

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,970
very hard not unless you're running an

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,820
engineering school or something like

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,340
that then you have a

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,289
you need immediately for linux on the

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,720
desktop but when you're getting it so

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:40,149
cheap in the educational institution

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,970
it's very hard to make the argument for

00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:45,759
that kind of open source driven movement

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,929
on the desktop and people know I'm a

00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,340
freedom hater anyway so this is fine

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:53,110
with me is it depends on where you are

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,389
like Virginia Tech all linux all over

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,279
the computer but I know a lot of

00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:59,889
computer science two departments are

00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:03,970
just teaching java and doing it on

00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:06,250
windows and right right yeah which is

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,809
unfortunate I'm a big I'm getting a

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,110
little right hold again here but i'm a

00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:14,529
big proponent of not just learning linux

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,509
not just learning windows in my role I

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:19,690
need to know everything and I feel like

00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:22,809
it's important to be it's cool man I'm

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:25,450
all about promoting I'm here to promote

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:27,580
open source but I don't think you should

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,019
be limited to one thing I said this last

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,190
time I'll city and these guys heard it a

00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,929
hundred times they probably gonna hate

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,879
me for telling the story again but I

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:38,049
went to you I go to stands every year I

00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:40,269
go to sands at Virginia Tech and I learn

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,740
different cool hacking crap and it's

00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:43,629
awesome right and they always it's

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,059
always a linux-based class and classes

00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:48,299
agree for that and edge scotus some of

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:51,100
you may know him hacker extraordinaire

00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,320
said it was like this was like seven

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,909
years ago to me he said he just said he

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,990
was talking about you know hacking on

00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:58,059
the windows command line and things like

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,279
that and he said but why limit yourself

00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,799
to the peacock reading that is windows

00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:06,309
and I was sitting there trying to get by

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,529
on linux and that hit me I'm like you're

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,129
right I need how can I call myself an IT

00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:16,600
professional and not no more than one

00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:18,090
box thing now that's I'm an IT so the

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,210
normal person do they need to know

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:25,330
cross-platform I would argue yes some

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,879
people don't if my father uses linux and

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,210
he doesn't even know it okay my father

00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:32,320
all his stuff is web-based I said dad

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,090
look I'm not going to spend a hundred

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,159
way dollars for windows license I'm not

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,769
going to steal it let me just put this

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,299
on there and see if he can get by I've

00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,279
not heard from him in like two and a

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:44,470
half years like he's totally cool man

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:49,169
everything is web-based right

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:51,789
um so you know it works for some people

00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:54,340
it's expensive right well I we just kind

00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:56,110
of talked about that is it expensive we

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,539
think windows is expensive but in the

00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,210
education arena it is not which is part

00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:07,299
of the problem with adoption so there

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:08,710
you where is the success underserved

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,929
community this is what I'm big and I

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,299
live in the second poorest County in

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,000
Virginia when we first moved there over

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:18,970
a decade ago my wife had a job for

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,890
community development program and they

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,530
were actually putting plumbing in houses

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:27,159
is people did not have plumbing in their

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:30,190
houses this is the early thousands there

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,630
are still dirt floors sixty percent of

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,240
the populations in poverty we have

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,530
fourteen percent unemployment which is

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,640
actually almost normal now which is

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:44,470
unfortunately and I like serving

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:47,440
underserved communities a very very big

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,770
problem in America with poverty driven

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,270
ignorance okay and it's not going away

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:58,620
it's getting worse the middle class is

00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:03,280
shrinking it all falls into this this

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,110
this education paradigm so this is

00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,700
something I always sell and these talks

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:11,830
open this org slash education so back in

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,830
k-12 when I was in k-12 if a student

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,530
wanted to do their homework in their

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,960
computer class we did not make them buy

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,490
a Microsoft license instead they could

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,510
go to the front desk at the school and

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:27,880
we had a stack of the open district /

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:31,990
education DVDs they could take it home

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,419
pop it in this is and wind all windows

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:38,380
programs okay everything on this disk

00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:42,700
all open-source windows programs it has

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:46,860
a LibreOffice on it it has just a tons

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:50,980
of stuff here's a list absolutely

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,710
fantastic tool why not hand this out to

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:58,020
underserved communities DVD is literally

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,020
cost a dime a dozen now literally

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:06,500
why not even if my kind of joke the last

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,860
time I did a similar talk to this is you

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,860
know Johnny it's not a joke Johnny can't

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:16,510
do his homework simply because mom and

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,220
dad can't afford windows no I'm a disc

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,080
let him do it awesome stuff so I don't

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,700
work a k-12 anymore and it's interesting

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,470
what happened when I left I'm going to

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,480
talk about that that's the not-so-nice

00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:33,519
truth that will get to know they have

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,519
windows everybody is windows man come on

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:37,850
that's what I'm say excuse me it doesn't

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,529
have office that's what I'm saying um

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:44,570
like these kids are taking you know just

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:47,029
even English now in high school requires

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:51,529
you to write the papers end and put them

00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:52,789
in on a word format you know give them

00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:54,470
this and let them do that's what I meant

00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:59,630
I'm sorry good thank you for let me

00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:02,980
clarify is it it's not orb is it porn

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,980
but i just sent everybody a porn site

00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:12,440
all right um so yes so underserved

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,779
communities it's really what drove me in

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,919
k-12 to do a lot of stuff that i did

00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:19,279
which i will talk about a little bit

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,700
developing nations this is a crazy crazy

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,679
link if you go to Wikipedia and look up

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,820
list of linux adopters in government I

00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,440
didn't know there was a list i just

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,880
started searching around this is pretty

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,220
cool who knows how accurate it is i mean

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,870
it said rob lowe was like one of the

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,350
founders of linux i don't know i'm

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:41,000
kidding so yeah just some real cool

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,679
quick stuff here the White House I take

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,090
I take partial credit for the White

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,419
House going on Drupal but i'll talk to

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,130
you about that afterward this you want

00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:54,679
because Aneesh Chopra was the everyone

00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:56,809
okay so two in 2010 Philippines filed a

00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,980
booty powered national voting sis I

00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:59,510
think that's cool I just think it's cool

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,649
that in the Philippines when you vote

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,450
you're on a boon to I just think that's

00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,919
freaking awesome it's not education but

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,159
i thought i'd throw it on there so here

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,090
we go macedonia 180,000 we took base

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,060
classroom desktops right on

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,260
brazil 20,000 linux desktops running in

00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,060
elementary and secondary public schools

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,960
go brazil brazil is an interesting

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,330
demographic when you look at how fast

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,370
Brazil and China and India are how fast

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,260
they're growing and the cool thing about

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,540
Brazil is they've always been open

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,700
source friendly everything is driven by

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,110
open source and Brazil it's fantastic I

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,050
want to go there but I don't speak

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,980
Portuguese and Russia announced in

00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,600
october two thousand seven at all at

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,850
schools computers will run on linux and

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,370
the Mafia is pushing that in red I'm

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,170
only kidding i don't i don't know who's

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,210
who's actually rolling that out but yeah

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,950
go Russia okay and I think there were

00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,330
some problems I remember seeing follow I

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,480
think we've talked about this I think

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,590
there was some follow-up article saying

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,270
that that kind of fell apart in Russia

00:27:52,590 --> 00:28:00,330
but hey good good for them for trying I

00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:01,770
don't know is what's that Microsoft

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:06,570
claim that Linux was communist and

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:08,130
whatever microsoft says me yeah and it's

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,620
which is really interesting now because

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,720
there's some interesting Linux tie-ins

00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,300
with Microsoft particularly on patent

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,610
front now where it's almost like you

00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,880
almost might think that Microsoft now

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,720
defends Linux very secretly but anyway

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,310
if you want to get in the conspiracy

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,310
theories later I could talk to answering

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:34,590
um it was I would seem i would say Matt

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,210
I would say Mac is a bigger pusher than

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,910
that yeah but they've been doing this

00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,910
for a long time even before either was a

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,500
real well it's hard to say it's hard to

00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,850
say but they're smart I mean it's smart

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,650
the first was for free i mean they knew

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,240
that a long time ago and it has been

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,630
cheap in education for a very long time

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,540
it's been over deck when i started

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:55,950
administrating windows I know it's been

00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,440
a long time it's been over a decade that

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,080
has been really really cheap which is no

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,910
whatever no like I say learn everything

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,500
you can get you if you can get your

00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,170
cheap five dollar windows seven then go

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,310
ahead and get it don't you know whatever

00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:11,700
money money those first two things are

00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:14,130
all money driven so very interesting

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,670
thing about where I work now because

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,260
it's a state institution I mean I mean

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,200
we're not completely rich but I have a

00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:26,070
lot more money than when I was in k-12

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,230
in k-12 I drove a lot more open source

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,330
adoption because of how little money we

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:34,200
have as much as we like to say open

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,940
source and and free software is cool and

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,040
great and you should just adopt it

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,810
because you you like it and it's the

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,800
good thing to do the fact of the matter

00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:49,020
is most times open source is driven by

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,520
money why free as in beer okay which is

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,780
an important factor when you see some of

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,480
the numbers i pull up in a few minutes

00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,480
here we could argue that but it's not

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,460
worth it progressive governments i am

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,110
going to skip that and there's my server

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,420
room right there so that's this is the

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:07,340
real success so it is one of my server

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,340
rooms this is a real success story to me

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,740
linux as a success story is more that

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,350
every single one of you has some kind of

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,940
lenox grill in your pocket right now see

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,380
these devices here that run my network

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,150
that blue code is actually shut off

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,170
isn't arrows are terrible like i got two

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,350
smaller those in one big one what

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:27,360
happened there I don't know so that blue

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,650
coat is an interesting devices for the

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,130
package shaper it's one of the ways that

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,750
i used to kill torrent downloading on

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,580
the network got to have to have it from

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:40,800
your education the bsd base box okay

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,480
palo alto networks okay if you've ever

00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,250
administered a firewall before and you

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,800
don't have a hundred people to

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,660
administer palo alto networks I'm just

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,200
saying I don't work for them I just love

00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,580
this box so much linux-based device

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,500
let's it's called the second-generation

00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,620
fireball look into it's awesome it's

00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,210
does it sniffs every single packet that

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,770
goes through the network without any

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,850
latency because they have this huge

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:07,110
management back pain fantastic device

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,160
you can run like TCP dump right off of

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,670
the two it's really cool and why are

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,530
shocking fella fire this is a cisco 3800

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,960
anybody know that cisco is actually

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:19,920
based on all their I their iOS's are

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,740
based on linux yes they are and in fact

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,660
cisco now all this data analysis goes

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,360
like whatever I can Cisco hate them with

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,000
a passion sorry Cisco people but i have

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,030
to like I have to run this 3800 it's the

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,780
supported device for our edge network

00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,460
and I've worked with Cisco fur

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,810
a long time it's just one of those

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,210
necessary evils unfortunately

00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,100
interestingly enough Sisqo now is in

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,380
like the content market man they're

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,830
going to rule the world right we will we

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,690
will cost you about 170 thousand dollars

00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,540
more than triple and deserve your

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,140
content for you and everything that they

00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,310
come out with is Linux pace now

00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,380
everything I mean they just came out

00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,560
with the the cs phones which flopped

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,810
terrible but that was an android-based

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,120
video phone let's just go roll down so

00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,260
it's good is those people that make a

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,690
lot of money off lenox and don't give

00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,110
anything back and did i say that sorry

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,910
and a couple other things here and see

00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,400
this is the success story for me and it

00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,460
is the eggs are barracuda spam firewall

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,840
runs letting here's an old a sa it's

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,880
turned off i just never pulled it out of

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:31,510
rack cisco my next there's the success

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,970
to me i feel like that all these devices

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,430
that you don't even think about run this

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,820
open source on the back end it's amazing

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:42,940
now I mean Linux runs the world it's

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:47,290
freaking awesome it's just too bad it's

00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:48,730
not on more desktops right ok so the

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,560
link slurs think that's the Linux

00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,950
lurking beneath that's my one of

00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,870
my tag lines for my podcast but and

00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:59,110
small steps to open source this is where

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:01,360
i encouraged people to take the small

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,850
steps it's not about taking someone's

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,020
head and smashing it into a linux laptop

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:10,060
you will use linux it's taking small

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,110
pieces of software and saying hey did

00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,880
you know that you're already using

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,610
firefox you know firefox has an

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,070
interesting story behind it it's a huge

00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,890
open source project that took over the

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,780
browser space and it's free to you and

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,580
the reason being is this is how the open

00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,230
source paradigm works and people get

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,440
interested in that my boss back when I

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,760
worked in k-12 had no idea he was using

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,860
all the symptoms or software so I

00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,840
started getting him into the dialogue of

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,600
it and he became interested now he runs

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,710
a boon to a home and it's been years now

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,030
we don't work together anymore and

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,170
unfortunately he still calls me if

00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,340
there's a problem with it but whatever

00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:48,700
he's a good guy alright so here's some

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,400
interesting things

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,240
implemented when I worked in k-12 and

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,220
some of it in higher ed interesting

00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,660
thing about Drupal I won't I mean these

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,080
guys know I can talk about 45 minutes

00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:07,120
for Apple how am i doing on time good no

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,470
I have okay cool cool all right so i

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,950
might have to speed through a little bit

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:15,220
of this but I just we just did an RFP at

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:17,770
the college for completely redo our

00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:22,630
website web sites build on history god

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:24,940
man and I hate like if you put something

00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,940
on is it's just like hackney please

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,740
PLEASE hack me you have no idea half the

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,360
time I administer that stupid firewalls

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,830
because people are trying to hack in I

00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,760
is I hate it so fortunately I wasn't

00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,620
there obviously when they built this

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,510
website originally I've been in my job

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,870
for three years so it's good it's due

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:45,130
for a refresh and we put an RFP out now

00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,630
for those of you don't want an RFP as a

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,100
request for proposal in a state

00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:50,320
institution if it's over a certain

00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,060
dollar amount you have to put a request

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,010
for proposal out and anyone in the world

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,910
can bid on it and then you look them

00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,410
over and you don't have to pick the

00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,360
cheapest one but you have to have

00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:01,300
legitimate reasons as to why you picked

00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,580
that proposal and then you go forward

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:07,600
with the project right freakin tedious

00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:10,570
let me tell you we got 32 responses to

00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,860
the RFP they ranged from seven thousand

00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,350
dollars to two hundred thirty thousand

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,810
dollars to read you the website we

00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,520
required in the proposal which is nice

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,980
part about RFPs that they use an

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,050
open-source platform so we narrowed it

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,040
down to five funny story I'm running low

00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:27,340
on time but I gotta tell the story

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,530
anyway 7 7 so 7 27 thousand dollar like

00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,720
7,000 you kidding me and it was this

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,740
company out of India I probably I can't

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,030
tell you too many deals a lot definitely

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:38,710
not hotel names but they had they had an

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,940
office and rest and the proposal came

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,000
out of reston but it was clearly a

00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,220
company for me and they had actually

00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,440
beautiful beautiful rfp my seven

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,650
thousand maws you kidding me they had

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,840
actually built a mock website for us and

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,280
you know the RP was only out for 30 days

00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,300
and they took some of the content they

00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,110
put it on their made it look nice but

00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,170
like why these guys know what they're

00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:01,660
doing seven thousand dollars were

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:04,180
but I i send the RFP over to my boss he

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,230
opens it up on his outdated windows box

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:15,460
and it got pwned the RFP had a virus

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:18,819
invented in it and I reported it to sams

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,109
and I talked to you too Mike poor was my

00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:22,539
instructor this past year and he's like

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:24,160
he said he said to me it was actually it

00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,619
wasn't embedded in the PDF that they

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,500
sent it was a link to that mock website

00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:32,319
had a flash cross-site vulnerability in

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,700
my bosses because my boss is we don't we

00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:36,490
don't touch my boss computer so it was

00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,799
had a date and got pwned bang awesome

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,770
right so anyway we reported it and

00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:46,390
obviously we didn't go with that RFP

00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:54,849
just a funny story did who ya

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:57,789
compromised yes so so so I don't know

00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:59,829
but um talking when if anybody knows my

00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:01,869
pores like a rock star in hacking

00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:03,130
community so I emailed him immediately

00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,420
I'm like what do I do with this and he's

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,500
like all my story and and he said

00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,319
chances are we talked it out a little

00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,559
bit chances are they got pwned and the

00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,390
template that they were using they

00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,000
unknowingly were sending out these RFP

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,760
now I talked to a few other people who i

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,010
will not name they said but it's and the

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,029
argument is made seven thousand dollars

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:30,190
it's an awfully low price for that RFP

00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:31,180
no one can close to that um the one

00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,650
we're going with about fifty four

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,000
thousand dollars so that gives you an

00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,020
idea and that they're using an

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,390
open-source fight they're gonna be using

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,640
Drupal for us okay but it's still

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,039
costing us 54,000 that was a read where

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,720
whoops I asked money huh interesting I

00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,789
mean it's a lot of work to me over

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,920
thousands of pages of content to a new

00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:49,990
platform off of one another so they're

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,410
doing all the legwork so that's what it

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:55,210
costs to do business fagus I'm video

00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,299
fagus anybody here know what foggiest I

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:01,420
know you guys because I've preached many

00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:05,890
times so is really cool right so in

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:10,370
IT you clone computers right we all you

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:11,840
ghosts archaea are archos know

00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,850
what is that not our ghosts are key I

00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,240
don't know it's a couple big apprised

00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:19,310
thank you this had been a while for a

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,820
huge network I've run about 2,200

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,860
computers costs around 30 brand to have

00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,740
cloning software if you purchase it to a

00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:31,070
papaya de vender fog does all of that

00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,360
and more for free it stands for free and

00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,130
open ghosts that they don't say that

00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:38,540
anymore because i think the got pinged

00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:41,240
on it it is absolutely fantastic stuff

00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,120
you can schedule clones you can do

00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,440
wake-on-lan also some really cool stuff

00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,650
with fog I could I could do an entire

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,470
presentation on five obviously I talk

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,470
too much anyway so we won't virtualized

00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,760
the network now argument I won't get

00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,440
into much in this because we did go with

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:04,870
VMware its proprietary software but

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:09,350
another linux based software actually

00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:11,540
but virtualization let's say what is it

00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,430
oh yeah right so there are plenty of

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,980
ways you can do it free and open source

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,480
that's why I put it up here I give you a

00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,820
lot of arguments why I went to VMware

00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,230
but you know it's interesting is once

00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,910
you get back virtualization platform

00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,920
it's awesome running linux on top

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,200
because you can just pump them such as

00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,600
out but yeah so it's another another

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,120
real big cost savings so this was the

00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,280
huge one there's a question mark this is

00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:39,710
what i talked about last time when i was

00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:43,070
here move the entire k-12 system

00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,850
completely off microsoft office and move

00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:49,490
to only open off this in google apps

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:52,760
successful implementation very painful I

00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:55,400
mean pitchfork and torches you want to

00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,930
take a teacher's office suite away you

00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,970
better be ready with both both your vest

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,910
but we did it and was successful and

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,080
everyone moved over to this now that

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,690
weren't running linux on a disk office

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,910
was windows-based but because of

00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,350
licensing fees for k-12 because i don't

00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,240
have that engine because in virginia

00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,710
member i said it's all county driven so

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,030
we were buying we weren't buying our

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,980
licensed as a conglomerate which i can

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,430
do now working for the state which makes

00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,360
really cheap so this is a little bit of

00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,740
fuzzy math

00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,140
it was around two hundred thousand

00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,650
dollars over about three years time that

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:38,930
we saved just through licensing and

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:40,970
moving people over to this right and

00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,170
handing out those this with it and then

00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,090
now it's compatible what everybody else

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,070
is running anyway and nobody cares right

00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,530
you would think so here's a not-so-nice

00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:51,880
truth three years ago I left my java k12

00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:56,450
and went to higher ed right go me and

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,610
they literally did not even smell me

00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,490
leaving the door before they started

00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:05,270
rolling out windows it took about a year

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,670
new management came in they don't run

00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:10,610
any of this stuff anymore fog is gone

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,860
there is no reason to get rid of fog

00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:15,590
it's free it works but they didn't

00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,330
understand it so they got rid of it now

00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,160
they're using a Microsoft I don't even

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,190
know what Microsoft uses is for cloning

00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,580
but now they're using that which costs

00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,470
them a fortune I mean I literally was 90

00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,760
this my kids go to this one is my wife's

00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,050
a teacher at the school district so I

00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,310
keep I don't know all the people that I

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,310
used to work for me and stuff yeah

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,890
agreed and and and this is you know and

00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,119
this is what I always say to that once

00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,680
the last time you called Microsoft cuz

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,920
you had a problem with word no one's

00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,369
ever done it they call the IT guy you

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,990
have your call yeah yeah right don't

00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,990
call my guess it's the worst thing I

00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,570
have talked to Microsoft as a directory

00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,790
system issue exactly extraordinarily

00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,349
expensive and really frustrating is

00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:14,599
basically what that boils down to if you

00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:18,170
call microsoft absolutely it's it's hard

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:24,609
I hate hiring I hate hiring no i I've

00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:24,609
not hired someone who's known linux ever

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,130
you're absolutely right that's why

00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,040
that's why guys for children and they

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,560
didn't understand what they were that's

00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,849
the only thing they know it's very much

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,050
an ignorance thing but you're right it

00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:43,580
support has as part of it I understand

00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,589
why they I understand why they switch

00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,930
back and we did we could talk about that

00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:49,490
all day and I do think it's unfortunate

00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,910
particularly for the underserved

00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:54,950
population now it's the teachers the

00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,170
ones that were fussing the students

00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:00,349
don't care students learn like that

00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:03,800
change no problem as the teachers that

00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:06,200
really pitched a fit long enough and did

00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,730
change out of administration so that's

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,940
the unfortunate not-so-nice troof of

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:13,250
that I've always been if your if your

00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,290
insecurities if your nit and network

00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,119
management you know there's I could talk

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,200
to you about a gazillion different tools

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,510
to manage your network that are open

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,420
source it's fantastic there's no reason

00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:26,690
to spend money on it they work and and

00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,400
there you go so I did want to mention

00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,869
because I know some of you are educators

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,290
I did want to mention some cool stuff

00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:36,800
you know just other stuff that I use or

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,880
have used over the years you know my

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,550
next terminal server projects is that

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,380
still going as anybody know it is yeah

00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,240
okay cool cool I haven't used in a few

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,030
years but that's awesome serves the

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,460
linux desktop through server yeah here's

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,580
some other cool stuff recently have done

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,140
quite a bit with snore

00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,030
I'd be happy to geek out with someone

00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,200
about that later yeah you know PFI

00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:04,430
through that for the like majorgeeks

00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,430
just just yeah right on and now cool I

00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:11,610
need a lot of stuff in there you know

00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,780
whatever all right I was worried that I

00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:17,100
was going to go to shorten go in too

00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:19,110
long that's awesome and the bloody

00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:23,190
aftermath I just talked about it okay

00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:25,110
got a little head of myself putting it

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,890
all together we're closing it up here

00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,570
friends get involved that's actually I'm

00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:34,050
my message and I did an extraordinarily

00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:38,670
poor job communicating it to you which

00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:40,110
is fine get involved be a voice we know

00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,000
as open source people that being a

00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,710
member of a community can be one of the

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,910
most fulfilling and important things you

00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,870
ever do in your life you might not get

00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:51,480
paid for it but you do get paid for it

00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,920
all right take that same philosophy and

00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,970
go out in your community and talk to

00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,800
educators talk to your fellow educators

00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:02,000
talk to your school boards go two lugs

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,560
go to conferences like this and scream

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,150
because it's important you are part of

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,700
your community oh thank you thank you

00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:11,760
appreciate it I know it's important and

00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,980
see it's important you are an important

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,080
member of community make sure that you

00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,180
are the voice that people go to and I

00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,980
said I didn't hire I've never hired some

00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,570
of the nose Linux you want to know how

00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,850
many many of my staff know linux though

00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:25,950
why because as soon as they walked in

00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:30,180
the door I said here's a laptop start

00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:32,100
learning be that voice be that person

00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,840
out there it's okay unless you look like

00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,900
330 to 3 30 show up then don't be the

00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,750
voice if you're scary looking you might

00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,170
not want to be the voice all right yes

00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:50,210
so there it is do I have time for how we

00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:50,210
doing oh we have plenty time all right

00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:56,130
thank you and here's my sign a little

00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,990
redneck go for you

00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:02,310
I'd be happy to take questions or you

00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,310
guys can bail what's up brother

00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:33,440
right right so the question by the

00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:36,830
amazing Dan washko of linux league tech

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,230
show was everything is proprietary now

00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:40,760
and only runs on Windows now Mac it runs

00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,380
a lot on Mac now but still doesn't run

00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,460
on Linux how do you get around that if

00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,030
you're trying to promote open source a

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,920
lot of house you don't that's it now if

00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,080
it's things like Photoshop you go well

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,490
you know it's funny a is a guy in

00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,040
the basement with leather on but it's

00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,130
also a really cool piece of software you

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,600
want to check it out and you hope that

00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,040
they'll be okay with it it's not the

00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,070
same Photoshop if you're a Photoshop you

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:07,690
and that's that's always been a problem

00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,690
not getting better I can't sugarcoat it

00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:14,000
there are remote desktops you still have

00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,500
to license them there are virtual

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,960
desktops you still have to license then

00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,390
but there are ways that you can now

00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:28,520
virtualize windows apps and put them on

00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:29,960
the linux desktop yep oh so open / rick

00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:36,070
i'm sorry so it's more of a curriculum

00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,070
question okay right

00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,220
I've not seen that now there is a huge

00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:53,570
movement for open and curriculum now

00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:56,390
please do right so a gentleman's point

00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,740
is there they're teaching Microsoft Word

00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,960
rather than just word processor that's a

00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:16,490
very problem that the whole ambiguous

00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:18,050
yeah that's true the you're right there

00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,520
so there is and that's unfortunate we

00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,460
see this grind every day that the

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,570
gentleman's point was there is a message

00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:29,390
by using proprietary software and and

00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:36,109
platforms for curriculum that that's the

00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:38,510
meth right right so curriculum is an

00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:40,160
interesting thing there's a huge push

00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:41,480
right now in America for open curriculum

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,900
which I think it's absolutely fantastic

00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,900
chip sure sure

00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:05,950
hmm okay we're getting into pedagogy now

00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:21,760
see I like pedagogy talk so which is a

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:26,020
lie um we're getting into like fascist

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:35,170
territory now but there is that's that's

00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:37,000
a cool concept okay let me repeat your

00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,160
point so that so that the camera gets it

00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,800
and then I will speak to it your point

00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,260
is that Microsoft and Apple have kind of

00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:47,500
proven this horrible proprietary grind

00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:51,970
system that is network now we're all

00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:54,580
part of I recompete completely what's

00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:56,770
going to happen in the world is the way

00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,050
the way I look at this is eventually

00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,600
those systems always fail because

00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,830
they're corrupt or at least they're

00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,520
supposed to it's kind of like our

00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:08,740
government actually so it will be

00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,290
interesting to see who wins in the long

00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:14,650
I completely agree and it kind of goes

00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,600
back to what you were saying dan is the

00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,430
proprietary grind is something like I

00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,900
need to I need to feed my family so I

00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,450
have to be a part of it I don't have to

00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,340
like it and I guess my point is be a

00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,920
part of the community that promotes

00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,080
open-source make sure you're out there

00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,760
that's part of the problem a lot of

00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:37,410
people don't know open source or even

00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,410
exists particularly in education right

00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:50,049
um right it has to be grassroots

00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:55,339
completely agree the point I was making

00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:57,680
on the slide of going to talk to your

00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:58,609
school board if you feel is there here

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,140
there's certain people in the world a

00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:01,579
hack to listen to you School Board

00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,470
happens to be one of them they don't

00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:04,819
have a choice you can go there and talk

00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,400
to them and they have to sit there and

00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:09,920
nod off they might not listen but they

00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,019
have to be there politicians are the

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,489
same way and if you feel strongly enough

00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:14,960
that your children are not getting a

00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:16,940
proper education you should go to your

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,410
school board and talk to them and if

00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,450
that has something to do with open

00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:24,430
source or not open source then go speak

00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:24,430
to them oh you want to say something no

00:51:40,510 --> 00:52:08,030
no yeah marketing right awesome point

00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,390
I'm going to I'm going to paraphrase for

00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:13,010
the camera what you said marketing

00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:15,380
that's the one that's the one thing that

00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:16,550
we have I mean that's our problem that's

00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,800
why I'm here right that's why I'm saying

00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,560
be a member of the community and be an

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,330
open voice because you are the open

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,950
source marketers people there is no

00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:30,200
budget for it congratulations you've

00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:39,430
been promoted I know it's a bad job but

00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:39,430
somebody's got to do it you know cool

00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:48,960
right

00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,660
well and it's also a marketing issue

00:52:48,960 --> 00:53:06,920
there as well yeah absolutely very cool

00:52:51,660 --> 00:53:06,920
who else anybody yes ma'am yes coreldraw

00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:14,400
absolutely yes yes yes yeah point a

00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,500
great point lotus 123 you know was the

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,470
same way it was that thing that you

00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,710
learned in the school which is it's the

00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:25,260
same paradigm and we're in a cyclic a

00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,570
cyclic kind of thing grind with

00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:42,530
proprietary software that sweet words

00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:42,530
sir absolutely yes yes that's the point

00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:49,050
yes gentleman's point is and as we were

00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:50,940
saying before you don't learn Microsoft

00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:54,000
Word you learn about word processing

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:56,280
right and you and I know because we're

00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:03,660
all like massive geeks you use one

00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:05,340
program you use them all right don't ask

00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,700
me that my wife's a teacher you're gonna

00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,700
get me in trouble

00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:19,740
oh we're back to pedagogy the system's

00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:21,930
brother a systems broke that is a

00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,819
pedagogy problem that's a problem with

00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:27,540
underfunding in schools bad teachers bad

00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:30,230
curriculum sad but true sorry for the

00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:33,270
camera point was gentleman was making

00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:35,130
was my kid goes to school in washes

00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:40,099
movies and had music instead of learned

00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:40,099
to read write and do arithmetic yeah

00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:20,810
okay okay so gentleman's point I have to

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,060
comment on this gentleman's point is 50

00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,890
years ago you learn something and you

00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,440
could you'd go to work and work for 30

00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,180
years on that concept now with

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,190
technology things are moving so fast

00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:36,800
that you have to constantly be learning

00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:38,930
agree and disagree its thing my son is

00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,300
doing his times tables those times

00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:43,670
tables were as handy as when I learned

00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:47,390
them as he's learning him now there are

00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:50,089
some base education foundations a person

00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:51,589
fifth person 50 years ago who read The

00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:54,680
Catcher in the Rye is that out then yeah

00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:57,170
and Rita today still gets massive

00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:59,480
amounts of value on it technology has

00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:03,380
nothing to do with it and we are losing

00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:06,140
the foundations of education not the

00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:08,420
technology in education and I think so

00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,790
too kind of you know I feel like there's

00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:15,740
actually a bigger problem with what with

00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:26,150
science math and and base literary yeah

00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:28,369
yeah job already yes yeah absolutely

00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,510
which is a great point yeah gentleman

00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:32,359
said that is a very good possibility

00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:35,589
that the job he has was going to have is

00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:35,589
not even around yet yeah

00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:47,750
okay we're still see this is no this is

00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:53,970
I don't like insulting teachers too much

00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:57,420
but tenure okay was never supposed to

00:56:53,970 --> 00:57:01,289
happen it was never supposed to be in a

00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:04,829
school district k12 tenure was not built

00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:06,869
the way it is used there is a huge

00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:10,079
problem that when a teacher gets tenure

00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:11,400
she can he or she can then see how those

00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,140
absorbs already talking about my wife

00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,299
did you see that I'm in trouble man now

00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:18,960
I'm kidding my wife's a great teacher he

00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:22,049
or she can skate by for the next 25

00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,599
years what other job is there that you

00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:26,430
can do that if there is one I'm sure

00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,680
it's failing as well that is part of the

00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:30,480
problem as our unions but you guys can

00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:38,430
i'll probably get stabbed later but

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:40,619
anyway okay okay cool and as it is in

00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:41,970
virginia as well yeah but you know you

00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,650
don't have to have unions to have the

00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:46,619
exact same corruption in the school

00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:48,569
system it's it's almost exact even

00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:50,970
without unions which is interesting

00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:53,609
because of tenure but anyway i go off on

00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,990
10 you for hours sorry for those

00:57:53,609 --> 00:57:56,390
educators in here that are banking on

00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:58,410
tenure but that's just the way I feel

00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,289
nobody's given me a free ride for the

00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:05,270
rest of my life some by that sounded so

00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:13,220
bitter all right who's next are we done

00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:13,220
okay what last question then yeah

00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:25,500
right marketing so great point gentleman

00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:27,390
says it doesn't matter if you're cold or

00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,260
not go out and support your open source

00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:32,670
community get involved 330 was not here

00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,710
and I make I want to make twice

00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:36,650
but now say something good about him he

00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,670
can't code his way out of a paper bag

00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,590
but he's on the marketing team for

00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:42,660
fedora why cuz he has different skills

00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,790
you can still be part of the community

00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:47,070
and contribute regardless of what you do

00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:49,880
that is my time thank you very much

00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,880
everyone for coming

00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,349
like that I prompt here for that glad I

00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,349
was awesome

00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:13,450
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:15,400
ago we could not have imagined that

00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,620
asterisk would not only become the most

00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,750
widely adopted open source communication

00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,790
software on the planet but that it would

00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:24,310
impact the entire industry in the way

00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:26,290
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,930
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:30,880
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,950
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,360
transition of power from the hands of

00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:36,640
the traditional proprietary phone

00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,040
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,110
administrators of phone systems using

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,760
this power our customers have traded all

00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,860
sorts of business changing applications

00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,660
from small office phone systems to

00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,760
mission-critical call centers to

00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,590
international carrier networks in fact

00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,030
there's even an entire country those

00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:54,310
communications infrastructure runs on

00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:56,440
esters the gym has always been about

00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,150
creating technology that expands

00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,310
communications capabilities in ways that

00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:01,510
we could never have imagined and that's

01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,910
part of what's game-changing about

01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:06,610
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:08,680
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:10,810
IP phones that extends control of the

01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,550
user all the way to the desktop the

01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,290
launch of these new products represents

01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:16,360
the next phase indigenous history of

01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:18,790
innovation these are the first and only

01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,500
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:22,030
power of esters when we first discussed

01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,070
our expectations for building a family

01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:26,230
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,970
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,590
the team to build the phones such that

01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,810
they were easy to install integrate

01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,640
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:36,220
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,840
that goal user feedback is validating

01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,970
that when it comes to operation with

01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,370
astro space systems including our own

01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:44,950
Switchvox based product these are the

01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:46,270
easiest to use best integrated most

01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,850
interoperable products on the market

01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:50,830
today the digitally phones will

01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:52,900
initially include three IP des hommes

01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:54,720
uniquely designed to complement any

01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,710
asterisk or switch box base solution

01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,380
these phones are different for a number

01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:02,020
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,460
designed for use with esters secondly

01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,070
we've made it really easy to

01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,450
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:09,550
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:11,470
to access information inside of asterisk

01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,490
allowing tight coupling between the

01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:15,070
application and

01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:17,230
phone additionally we've created an

01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,360
applications engine that allows users

01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:22,600
and developers to create and run their

01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:24,369
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,320
done all of this at a very compelling

01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:28,000
price point at Digium we're always

01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,100
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,680
the best value in business phone systems

01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,210
and also give them the power to create

01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,369
their own solutions or any

01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:38,080
communications challenge well continue

01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:39,520
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,560
Astra's cooler bastard more

01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,180
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,670
asterisk and what communications even

01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:49,350
easier and together we'll change the way

01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:49,350
the world communicates again

01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:37,920
past thats everywhere this is the way to

01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:39,840
better utilize all your resources and it

01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,900
makes managing all your resources pretty

01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:47,760
easy all of the innovation is happening

01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:51,120
in open source the collaborative nature

01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,790
and of the you know of the community and

01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,680
the speed at which these are these you

01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:57,780
know these these deficiencies these bugs

01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,390
are getting discovered and then fixed is

01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:01,830
it like that really shows the power of

01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,590
the you know of the open source

01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:06,740
community it is global and it's

01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:10,290
definitely because of the users

01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:16,170
community people are extremely friendly

01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:17,970
and always ready to help if you go an

01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:20,190
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,830
helping each other out and they're all

01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:24,510
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:27,500
product is transparent for everyone

01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:30,450
everyone can look at the code base

01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,190
everyone can see how close darkest is

01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:38,040
being built nothing nothing is

01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:40,710
proprietary everything is open in many

01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:44,880
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:48,660
ongoing health I'll stack the most

01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:52,470
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:55,200
was our first developer boot camp

01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:57,869
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:01,830
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:06,000
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:08,820
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,369
chairs into the room twice everything

01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:14,700
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:17,670
is open source and so I don't think that

01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,440
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:22,470
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,020
computing and so i think it's i think

01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:26,520
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,660
about cloud computing you're really

01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:33,210
talking about open source cloud

01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:36,359
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:38,730
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:42,630
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:45,330
each data centers these hardware is

01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:48,810
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:51,510
to handle number one that mass scale

01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:54,690
number two it's designed to handle the

01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:57,570
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:01,740
deployments started working on cog deck

01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:05,010
over four years ago and it was the

01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:06,780
original set of people working on it had

01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:10,890
a background of delivering software

01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:15,150
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:18,750
lots of users actually using it high

01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:21,839
availability is a key feature multiple

01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:23,849
hypervisors support different network

01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:26,520
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:28,800
you better while step management server

01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:32,490
can be deployed in different physical

01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:34,140
machines it definitely has a huge

01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:39,119
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:41,700
there's a major movie studio that they

01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:45,000
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,980
to transcode video and I thought that

01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,630
was terribly fascinating what I found

01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,900
more fascinating is what they did during

01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:54,690
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,070
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,680
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:59,920
the instance

01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:02,589
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,240
vast it touches so many different

01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:06,130
aspects and there's no one person that's

01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,790
kind of like a master of all those

01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:12,670
realms I think CloudStack as a project

01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:14,920
is going to be one of the leaders simply

01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:20,020
because it's some of the most feature

01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:24,099
folan and and robust platforms out they

01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:26,640
were I don't senior living through the

01:06:24,099 --> 01:06:26,640
clouds dag

01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,440
