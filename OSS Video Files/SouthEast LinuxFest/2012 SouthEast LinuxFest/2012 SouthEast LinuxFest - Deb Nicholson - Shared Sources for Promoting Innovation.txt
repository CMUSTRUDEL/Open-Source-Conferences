	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,069
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,440

linux fest visit www.lend expense org

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,350
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,310
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:35,460
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:39,570
possible he's gonna introduce me first I

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:50,280
think is that work for I think it's that

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:52,260
time yeah all right she's a community

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,090
outreach director at open invention

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,489
network and the community manager for

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,260
media goblin she's going to be speaking

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,449
about shared resources for promoting

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:10,130
innovation where you can do regarding

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:14,340
the software patents thanks um so uh

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,080
just a little background on me I i I'm a

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,570
free software activist I got here kind

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,790
of via the work to promote free speech

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,820
and increase access to the political

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,750
process and protect civil liberties and

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,790
so working in that space I had this idea

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,439
that we're probably missing out on some

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,390
things that were going on in technology

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,119
and when i discovered the free software

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,110
movement i was like aha that was it so I

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,229
come from I kind of had already

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,850
suspected that to food choices are

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,850
really bad for our society in general

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,329
but in specific operating systems or no

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,430
exceptions so so now I as he said I'm

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,079
working at media gamla and the open

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,490
invention network so oh and I were small

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,340
groups so if you guys have questions in

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,079
the middle or things you want to clarify

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,590
we can be really casual and then just

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,459
raise your hand so the open invention

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,780
network is a defensive patent pool for

00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,440
Linux both on the desktop phillies the

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,920
gooney linux

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,820
user space and then also the on the

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,650
mobile on mobile devices so what we have

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,930
is a defensive patent pool everyone

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,660
who's part of the pool greased and

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,460
mutual non-aggression on linux and

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,600
related technology that's would you know

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,310
within the purview we also do some work

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,050
to block bad software patents by

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,020
encouraging people to file defensive

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,900
publications and to create power art and

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,720
we will often give free advice to Linux

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,550
projects and you know with the regards

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,670
to like patents and other kinds of

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,030
issues that are similar so so that's

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,230
what the open invention network is

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,350
mostly based out of raleigh although i

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,140
work at my house in cambridge so there

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,910
we go so just i think probably everyone

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,040
agrees with me on this one like you're

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,930
all here spending your Saturday at a

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,940
linux fest because you believe that free

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,830
software is important is that everybody

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:19,890
does that describe everybody here ok

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:24,480
great huh oh it's like a bridge to a

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:26,160
hazy future we can't see it my um I went

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,140
to school for painting and sculpting so

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,700
like I'm more of a like visual person

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,140
i'm going to try not to like read off

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,690
the slide because i think that isn't

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,010
that interesting because then like it

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:41,239
then you could just read along with me

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:43,709
and so on you know need to be here so so

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,269
so summer some of the reasons that i

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,989
think free software is really critical

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,820
for our futures you know it helps to

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,950
open countries with minority language

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,750
groups to be able to participate in

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,670
technology so like brazil is a great

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,950
example you know there's there's free

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,310
software written in the basque language

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,070
which is like a tiny tiny piece so it's

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,630
a great for cultural diversity it's also

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,190
really great for small businesses

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,019
there's a lot of really great small

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,280
business software that is completely

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,620
free so like if you have a

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,239
veterinarian's office like someone has

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,030
already written some kickass software

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,160
for that i think also dentists like a

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,970
very small dental practice you can get

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,980
great software so like

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,560
massive massive installation doesn't

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,380
work for maybe your foreperson business

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,630
but you can take something that's free

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,120
and tailored specifically to your need

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,100
and have a one you know not not

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,960
one-size-fits-all solution but like one

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,380
just specifically for you so I think

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,360
it's good because in you know we're able

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,070
to support and empower like small

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,620
businesses and that we wouldn't

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,110
otherwise be doing so so that's a little

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,460
bit why I think it's important probably

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,270
everyone agrees with me on this part too

00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,400
right so according to a recent paper by

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,500
James Besson at Boston University he

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
wrote we find that npe and that's

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,380
non-practicing entities or patent trolls

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,000
we find that npe lawsuits or associated

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,600
with half trillion dollars of lost

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,660
wealth to the defendants from 1992 2010

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,180
so during the last four years the last

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,740
wealth has averaged over 80 billion per

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,419
year these defendants are mostly

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:27,430
technology companies who invest heavily

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:30,190
in rd knows so that's a lot of money so

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,630
getting sued you know it costs money and

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,980
i think that the time could always be

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,360
better spent on the part of the

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,950
technology company unless of course

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,570
you're the four hundred dollar an hour

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:43,000
lawyer you know it's good to be the king

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,440
and but i also think humanity's time

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,750
could be better spent so like in that

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,760
kind of big picture sense when I think

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,680
of like you know we could send people to

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,540
the moon we could you know right

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,780
software to help people with

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,890
disabilities to participate more fully

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,690
you know in the internet and such and we

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,320
said we can do like a million things you

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,520
know maybe not time travel but

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,460
humanity's time could definitely be

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,200
better spent than the giants suck of

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,190
resources and time that goes into patent

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,419
troll foods also frivolous lawsuits like

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,910
the patents patent troll suits tend to

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,440
deter innovation so a company that's

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,590
being sued often sees its stock prices

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,750
plummet and it has huge impact on morale

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,850
so suddenly like you thought you're

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,849
working for your your company on your

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,979
stuff and now you're poor you're you're

00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:37,120
possibly going to be you know the fruits

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,990
of your labor are going to be poured

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,480
into some

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,760
other company that just chose to see you

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:48,340
so so it also it makes people kind of

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,470
avoid certain areas so like MPEG LA as

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,150
that's all of the video patents and

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,410
they've put out their leg if you're

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,060
doing anything in video you're

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,320
definitely violating a patent we have

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,030
which we're not going to let you see or

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,280
get real specific about but you can pay

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,700
us it's kind of like an old school like

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:07,480
you know you pay me and so like

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,210
then people end up avoiding like whole

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,670
areas and so that's definitely bad for

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,890
innovation and the goal the original

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,540
goal of patents in the US system is that

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,880
they're supposed to encourage innovation

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,300
which was like a great idea if you were

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,340
you know like horse and buggy days where

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,050
it's like oh well I gotta you know get

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,780
on my horse and buggy and go borrow

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,330
money from like 15 people that live you

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,790
know hundreds of miles away and then

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,590
invest in my great idea so if you can

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,380
give me like two years to like make that

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:45,730
happen which is not the way that stuff

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:49,840
works now obviously wintech right oh

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:54,850
yeah yeah we'll get to the again for the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,740
choir right here right so okay so how do

00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,390
you know if you're infringing I had put

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,340
a picture of like a patent that I

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,950
riginal it's going to put up a picture

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,230
of a patent that got kicked off like it

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,520
was overturned and then i was like what

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,230
if they found a way to bring it back and

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,000
then i would be subjecting everyone had

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,590
seen that slide 2 treble damages and i

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,900
don't want to do that so now i get a

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:20,890
nice fuzzy blue sky and so yeah it's

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,750
it's it's pretty difficult so this this

00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,630
particular patent was a win do people

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:33,730
know what this one is like this this is

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:39,280
just the title this was um so it's red

00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:41,380
hat novell in 2007 were sued by nnpe for

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,470
user interface with multiple workspaces

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,910
for sharing displaced system objects and

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,560
there was like three patents with this

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,030
under this title this is x windows from

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,670
1987 so we'll xerox

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:58,840
patent that somebody bought up when they

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,690
divested all their stuff and soon 1987

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,060
and then in 2007 they finally were like

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,270
hey it looks like you guys are using

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,470
some display system objects so so these

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,350
are the kinds of suits that we're

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,390
talking about IP innovations the company

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,500
that brought this suit is not going to

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,570
be able to bug you about this one

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,330
anymore like the three drunk patents on

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,300
this with this title were knocked out we

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,310
hope but of course the student still

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,290
costs a lot of money and you know so

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:32,020
that's that's pretty crap it's a yeah i

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,920
am i actually had went into like the

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,560
patent because I mostly don't write code

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,940
so I actually looked at the patent site

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,620
like the US patent site where you're

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,150
supposed to go and be like oh I wonder

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,980
if someone already came up with my

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,150
awesome banana carrier idea or whatever

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,550
and you're supposed to search in there

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,670
and so like I searched around for like

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,800
display system objects and the number of

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,020
things that you got for like display

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,110
system objects just just titled that it

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,170
was like thousands and it was crazy and

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,180
you know and they were all like and so

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,190
even you know and so even assuming that

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,890
the person who had invented invented

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,120
something else had actually named it

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,250
what you think it ought to have been

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,380
named as well like you guys were in like

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,510
one mind on what that should be called

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:20,500
us ought to go through like tons of

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,220
stuff also I'm not sure if this is

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,720
intentional or they just have like super

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,910
low resources but it was like the

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,880
slowest page in the whole world to load

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,400
and you got like ten patents at once and

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,820
it wasn't like a fancy page it was like

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,130
it was like a text like only and and

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,920
then just like ten links to patents

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:45,910
would load up and it was like

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,529
you know so so I'm not suggesting that

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,240
you search the patent database because

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,220
of the treble damages that I mentioned

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,560
before where you get where you pay more

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,950
if you're willfully infringing then if

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,529
you're not knowledgeable and are just

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:03,430
accidentally infringing although there

00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:07,290
was maybe some inference that willfully

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:11,380
being unknowledgeable might make you

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:17,010
like a willful infringer so I know it's

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,010
it's um it's a yeah

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,780
right yeah we can all drive some acid

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,780
later and it will totally make sense no

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,380
I we're not going to do that but and it

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,460
still might not make sense yeah so so

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,260
I'm going to go over a little bit of

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,300
like how we got here so this is like the

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:48,490
this is the 10-cent tour through patent

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,970
legislation or I'm sorry litigation so

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,590
the 1952 amendment to the Patent Act

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,970
they added the word process to the list

00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,030
of what is patentable this is just in

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,710
the US the UK and in other systems work

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,900
a little bit differently although a lot

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,270
of companies that have patents in

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,130
software arena choose to litigate on

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,380
them in the US because of the way that

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,530
our system works in particular West

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,850
Texas so so they added the word process

00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,850
to the list of what is patentable in

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,710
1952 and they were definitely talking

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,560
about industrial processes at that point

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,940
and not software just so we're clear the

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,860
next case oh god traffic versus Benson

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,920
they decided that math is not patentable

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,080
so there was a was like a combination of

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
things in the court said pretty firmly

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,760
that they felt the agar-agar of them

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,530
should not be patentable and that that

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,890
kind of video that got shows a little

00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:44,140
way as well see in this couple slides

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,839
then the next piece was a Parker versus

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,160
look and then they said that

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,160
mathematical algorithms are patentable

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,980
if the implementation is novel and

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,260
non-obvious so if you just are patenting

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,900
the algorithm you can't have it but if

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,570
you're implementing it in a way that is

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,900
novel and non-obvious then you can have

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:07,150
a patent in this suit was about whether

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,550
or not having an alarm or some kind of a

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,920
trigger to signal a catalytic converter

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,850
the liq when its operating outside

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,350
certain desirable parameters ought to be

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,150
patentable and so in the end the

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,730
algorithm wasn't patented but the

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:25,030
application of the algorithm what's so

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,280
like if you I mean there's really no

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,110
point in having an algorithm that you

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,420
don't apply to anything because then

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,270
they're just hanging out but so you can

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,560
see this is a little bit of leg to find

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,860
what is is you

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,500
no kind of a thing so the next one

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,450
diamond versus deer and this is about a

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,400
physical process controlled by our

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,370
programs as a combination of the two

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,190
elements they decided is patentable and

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,410
this case was about software that was

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,290
being used to control the process of

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,580
curing rubber like four tires and stuff

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:03,430
so which is apparently pretty tricky but

00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:06,820
that's but they decided that that the

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,730
again the application of the algorithm

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:14,550
in the device was what made it novel and

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:17,200
non-obvious and then patentable so next

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,089
the next one was the Federal Circuit

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,770
Court well this is not a case this is a

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,200
the Federal Circuit Court was set up to

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,779
hear appeals on software cases I'm sorry

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,300
yeah on software cases and so these

00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,070
sorry patent cases but also software

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,960
patent cases these courts were largely

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,000
presided over by patent attorneys and

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:38,680
this is the case all that was created

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,380
here ended up being the road to the

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,030
patentability of everything including

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,680
software so in the lower courts in the

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,380
US have to abide by the higher courts

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,210
precedent and the idea here was that

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,910
like Oh we'll have people who are

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,040
experts in patents deal with all the

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,050
patent cases and then the experts that

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,140
they found were of course patent

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,030
attorneys some of whom or had been made

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,070
very wealthy by the enforcement of

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,780
patents and felt very you know as warm

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,589
and fuzzy as anyone feels about a giant

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,880
pile of money toward patents so

00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:14,589
basically they put cookie monster in

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,660
charge of the cookie jar here so alpat

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,550
they decided that the installation of

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,160
software on a device creates a new

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,050
patentable machine so you can see we're

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,339
spinning wildly out of control into

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:30,130
silly land here this one was odd derided

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:32,170
as the piano roll blues by one of the

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,270
dissenting judges he said like a piano

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,910
like a player piano is the same no

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,490
matter which role of song you put on

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:41,800
there I'm a little fuzzy on how piano

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,029
player plano's work but but it's

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,089
basically like it's the same thing

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,740
whatever kind of you know info you put

00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,440
on it

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,820
they were like no no no it could be it

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:57,089
could be new and then the 1998 State

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Street case is where we get the useful

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:02,190
concrete and tangible document doctrine

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:06,330
and that was um it was about in a

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:08,100
business method patent from and then it

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,020
was like they were looking at a business

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,320
method patent in this one and they

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,630
wanted to apply the youthful concrete

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,640
and tangible so not useful concrete or

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,649
tangible but like there were like maybe

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,720
patentability ought to be like all three

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,779
of these things that didn't last that

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,480
was struck down as you guys are probably

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,640
aware and then then we had a big long

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,200
gap of time where the supreme court

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,300
chose not to hear anything about

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,470
Pattinson or software patents at all

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,339
like they didn't really want to get into

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,380
it until 2010 when they decided to hear

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,970
bilski versus capos and this is another

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,600
business method patent this is about

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,279
hedging risk which is like Oh save some

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,140
for a rainy day kind of a thing so

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,120
that's like a really big idea but they

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,860
put a lot of financial language words in

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,730
there and it made it sound like kind of

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,500
a big deal a lot of folks had high hopes

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,829
for this when I was working at the FSF

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,360
we were organizing to put an amicus

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:05,640
brief together and get a lot of folks to

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,290
sign on people were like please use this

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,970
to strike down software patents please

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,069
use this to get rid of business method

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,870
patents and probably even got folks like

00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:16,589
talking about genetics and other leg you

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:18,329
know law nature things and so they were

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,069
like people were really excited like

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,300
yeah the Supreme Court finally is going

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,579
to hear something maybe they will

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,860
finally make something you know change

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,140
this they didn't and this is exactly

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,429
what Judge Stephen said he said if a

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,990
high end of bar is not set when

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,570
considering patent applications of this

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,670
sort patent examiner's and courts could

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,890
be flooded with claims that would put a

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:43,559
chill on creative endeavor and dynamic

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:45,179
change if so this um this is from John

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,270
Stevens and this is this is where the

00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:51,120
Supreme Court is that was at on in 2010

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,470
so they were like what problem well let

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,740
us know if there's a problem and then

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,230
we'll do something about it and so I'm

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,179
not I don't know maybe maybe we should

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:04,799
send them like a slash shot login

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:07,379
free come on check it out but yeah so

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,789
that didn't work out not the movie I'm

00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:13,200
just no spoiler so this uh we're still

00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:15,899
kind of trying to sort out what this one

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,940
means the the actual prometheus case is

00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:20,159
good this is like but it's not about

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:25,320
software unfortunately but it is about

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:27,419
patents so Prometheus sued Mayo Clinic

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,720
so Prometheus Laboratories is like a

00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,610
pharmaceutical company and they had this

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,710
they're brilliant idea was like step one

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:40,200
put a drug in the patient step to

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,639
measure it with this like range that we

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,200
decided as the range and then step three

00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:49,110
decide whether or not to adjust the

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,700
dosage and and that was the patent I'm

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:56,009
stripping out a lot of the

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,960
pharmaceutical huh yes that and um and

00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:00,720
so that is actually what the Supreme

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,090
Court decided they they said that so

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,549
this this is a win because they said

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,590
you're patenting a natural phenomena

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,869
like measuring the level of something in

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,669
people's blood is like just you know

00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:14,840
they're just people still you can't

00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:18,029
patent them and then they also said that

00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,730
it's the part like the step two we're

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:23,159
like you are I'm sorry the step 3 where

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,200
you then adjust the dosage is like a

00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,679
thing that doctors do all the time and

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,779
is pretty obvious it's it's a lake this

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,179
was this was in courts for like maybe

00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:35,220
like three weeks so it was like some

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:37,019
group of people that are like like

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,179
normal for them for three weeks was

00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,100
getting up and listening to like you

00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,289
know like well you know we discovered

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,230
this like amazing range for this

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:49,460
autoimmune drug and you know so good we

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,840
spent a lot of money blahblahblah so um

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,919
so this one you know so for the

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,659
pharmaceutical industry this is well for

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,149
the pharmaceutical industry this is bad

00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:02,129
news for patients this is good news for

00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:03,690
people that are opposed to the

00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:07,049
patentability of everything under the

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,929
Sun this is also good news so that range

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:13,389
is actually some mathy algorithm stuff

00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:17,200
and so people think that perhaps perhaps

00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:19,929
courts will turn around and say it like

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,279
oh that one has algorithm and this one

00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:23,289
has algorithm we should get rid of all

00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,179
the algorithm ones i think that's

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,589
unlikely to happen although it is a nice

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,950
thing to think about for a minute like

00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:32,739
we could pretend maybe maybe no that's

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,019
I'm sorry it's probably not there's

00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:36,969
already a lot of stuff like a Weedle

00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:39,159
those West Texas guys get a hold of this

00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,509
and can figure out a way to like carve

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,239
out all the nooks and crannies around

00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:45,789
this you know stupid decision right so

00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:48,909
like you know case law is complicated

00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:51,399
there are a lot of cases but for for

00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:53,649
people that have Crohn's disease their

00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:55,659
doctors can now without paying from he

00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:58,149
theists a giant fee adjust their dosage

00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,769
outside of the toxic range for them so

00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:07,749
if you know anyone has Crohn's disease

00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:09,820
yay this is a win so um so this is some

00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:11,639
of the patent publications held by feel

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,549
the most active collectors in the US

00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:17,709
this one acacia this is one of their

00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,509
subsidiaries his IP innovation so and

00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,579
they brought that x windows suit that we

00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:26,129
talked about a little bit couple slides

00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:27,969
ago there's also been like some

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:29,259
speculation that they have some weird

00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:32,739
ties to Microsoft because I p

00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:35,109
innovations or I'm sorry like yeah they

00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:37,539
hired a couple of folks that used to

00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,399
work at Microsoft so like in there's no

00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:41,859
like real paper trail there I don't know

00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:44,529
it's it's it's a little bit fuzzy but it

00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:46,239
is interesting to note and that like you

00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:48,609
know IP innovations took on redhat

00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:50,079
nouvelle with like you know I don't

00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,759
maybe they drank the kool-aid and they

00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,409
really do think like that open source

00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:59,079
should is the scourge of the universe or

00:21:53,409 --> 00:22:00,190
something but um huh yeah see that's the

00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:02,049
thing where it's like maybe they just

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,909
got a taste of the suing and just like

00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:04,989
it now so I don't know it's hard to say

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,609
that's what I'm saying it's like a

00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:08,879
speculative you know we don't really

00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,879
know

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:24,110
yeah oh this is yeah this is from patent

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,360
freedom and so um their numbers then

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,399
maybe like a year or two old so on the

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,740
load since numbers I don't have but um

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:33,919
yeah patent freedom is a great side if

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,960
you want to be depressed but and have

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,320
numbers to back it up so you could take

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:42,020
a look at that and still League so all

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,049
of these companies this is what they

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,789
make I don't actually know that they

00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:49,220
make rubber band balls I only assume

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:50,840
that anyone with a desk and employees

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,890
you know sitting at desks make the

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,020
rubber band balls the still like

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,419
intellectual Ventures has 10 offices and

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,529
700 employees so I'm petting there's at

00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,470
least a couple of rubber be involved

00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:06,020
there the money of course is not to

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,480
scale that's a single coin it came out a

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:14,480
blurry this time around let's take a

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:16,370
look at the money so 14 mp's raked in a

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,159
combined seven point six billion over

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,600
ten years and that represents only about

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,980
nine percent of what the companies who

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,260
were sued actually lost so the

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,059
defendants lost an estimated eight a

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:31,940
seven point six billion so this is um

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:33,830
this is this is companies that are

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,029
employing developers and are employing

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,890
designers and they like like I said the

00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:42,890
stock price goes down so some of this is

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,539
like projected revenue injunctions

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,700
happen and they have to stop shipping a

00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:49,970
product so like that's that projected

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,279
revenue is also included here and then

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:55,960
you know let's not forget that attorneys

00:23:52,279 --> 00:24:00,140
must also be paid out of this pile so

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,600
basically 14 companies they sent notes

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,570
and got seven point six billion dollars

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,940
but they deprived the software industry

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:12,110
of eighty seven point six billion

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,330
dollars so so one of the one of the

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,130
things that people kind of like to

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,590
imagine like oh it can't be all that bad

00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,240
like one company sues another and then

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,159
they make the product and we all get the

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,710
gain and it's

00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,440
they don't and the revenue doesn't

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:30,309
happen and the product doesn't ship and

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,889
so and and and this is the the ratio

00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:35,229
like they're sponging it off and then

00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,869
ninety-one percent of that potential

00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:45,789
revenue is on the floor so just gone

00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:48,070
okay so that's um that's grim right so

00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:50,950
in addition to the money there are also

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,609
other problems the threat of software

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,379
patents impact standards it dictates

00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:58,539
what skippack what gets packaged it

00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:00,809
creates extra work and it ends up making

00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:03,460
the user experience less than ideal like

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,379
how many times have you guys tried to

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,820
get a friend to use free software and

00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:09,129
then they're like how come it doesn't do

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,899
the you know fill in the blank whatever

00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:12,820
thing or actual literal fill in the

00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:15,789
blank like autofill on calc or something

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,289
and they're like because you were like

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,409
I'm going to show you a sparkly unicorn

00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:24,729
it's like um this one is going to grow a

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:26,859
torn back soon sorry so you know so

00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:29,799
there's that um Apple has suggested that

00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:32,109
the aura the video standard might be

00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,899
patent encumbered might be it definitely

00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:37,749
slowed enthusiasm for adoption of that

00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:39,279
format like I said MPEG LA as implied

00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:41,320
that all video standards are in

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,359
violation of their patents so you know

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,220
you can't do anything with them they

00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,909
date yeah who knows it have a lot of

00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,470
patents so you know it's very possible

00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:55,029
they license usage of their patents for

00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:57,279
money like I said fedoras excludes play

00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:59,559
black of encrypted dvds and they're out

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,869
of the box install just to be safe so

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,999
you know tsilivi are like how can we can

00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:08,080
watch movies on your machine like mmm

00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:10,690
patents that's why so for years of

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,729
patent concerns made Crump like had made

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,259
fonts look really crummy on linux

00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:18,159
distributions do you guys remember like

00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:20,379
the truetype fonts patent and then also

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,499
but uh you know so now they look a

00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:25,960
little better but the we still have to

00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:28,599
work around the clear type technology

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,059
this is a Microsoft product for

00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,499
sub-pixel rendering so like there's some

00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,609
stuff you can download but it doesn't

00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:34,809
come shipped with it so you have to go

00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:36,249
looking for it and

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,340
I looked at it and it was a little

00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:44,559
beyond my I was like so these are

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:46,509
unrendered subpixels and then yeah and

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,820
red had had to remove the autofill from

00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:50,769
their version of calc and then patent

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,720
fear can also cause projects to do a lot

00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,820
of extra work so like the tomtom suit

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,940
where microsoft had sued the gps folks

00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,669
for the file location table patents in

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,259
the linux kernel which is the in case

00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:04,509
people don't know what the super magic

00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,309
convention there is sometimes you have a

00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:07,749
short name a short version of the name

00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,879
and sometimes you have a long version of

00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:14,590
the name any of them you know in a table

00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:17,320
so that was that's in the linux kernel

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,029
and so a whole bunch of kernel developer

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,369
I don't know how many kernel developers

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:22,779
there are in the world I expect it's a

00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:24,429
finite number and that they could

00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:27,610
probably be doing something better with

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,799
their time but they all you know we had

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,840
to have folks work on the linux kernel

00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,149
and make sure that they were skirting

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,649
very carefully the file allocation table

00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:41,230
patent so there's also like some stuff

00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:43,240
just gets like you know is just wiped

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,269
out of existence there's a guy who works

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,009
on like he was he was doing little

00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,960
plug-ins for just in his spare time

00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:51,879
for fun like this guy in germany and

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,679
like someone at Borland I don't know if

00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,149
was like new guy and the IP department

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,950
was like Hello let's see if we could

00:27:55,149 --> 00:28:00,159
monetize some of this stuff so he got a

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,720
letter and he was like I'm just a guy

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,539
that works on this stuff in my spare

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,249
time like screw that noise and so like

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:08,139
he deleted it and then eventually had to

00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:10,149
put up a note saying like please stop

00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:11,710
asking me for the plugins I'm never

00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:13,809
putting them back I got a note from

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,119
borland I am in no way shape or form

00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:18,940
willing to get sued over this like they

00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:23,619
are gone like stop asking so they're

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:29,049
just gone a woman yeah probably probably

00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:32,009
its equivalent maybe you could go in the

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,940
Wayback Machine and find it or something

00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:38,289
what's up

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:41,139
oh well it's probably to match but

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:43,299
I don't know what's it yes it would be

00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:49,990
GPL yeah but it would be it would be to

00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:51,700
this was a couple years ago oh yeah yeah

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,960
if you find them you can fork them and

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,730
then you might get a note from borland

00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:04,350
foot you know don't tell them don't say

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:04,350
I didn't warn you those plugins uh-huh I

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:25,409
don't smack people just so you know oh

00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:33,129
yeah let me do a little bit of

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:36,190
background yeah so gplv2 doesn't mention

00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:39,850
software patents at all and the gpo

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,830
works primarily under copyright law so

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,600
copyright law is designed for like songs

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,299
and music and books and poems and all

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:51,340
that jazz and the patents are for like

00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:53,470
ideas or concepts or whatever yeah well

00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:57,159
now it is v right yeah or like it's

00:29:53,470 --> 00:30:00,070
supposed to be four dimensions so right

00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:03,460
so but if you have like a like a

00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:06,789
functionality that you figured out

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,409
another way to achieve that could that

00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:09,610
could still be patent infringement if

00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:11,830
someone has a patent on that

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,450
functionality whereas copyright

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,529
infringement is when you have like

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:19,539
wholesale cut and paste so you know so

00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:23,940
the people kind of get that like

00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,940
trademarks totally separate blah blah so

00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:32,320
huh right it is it was designed for more

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,889
for like creative works none of the

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:39,610
current like IP tools were designed with

00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:43,289
software in mind and so you know it's a

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,289
you end up with a clunky fit

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:52,600
copyright it is a written work by people

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,340
yeah okay so so there are some things

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,659
that can be done and that's we're going

00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,799
to go on that bed and then I'll open it

00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:03,509
up for questions so a period of patent

00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:06,070
this is like at Linux defenders org

00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:08,769
we're working on gathering background

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:11,980
for the USPTO to look at before bad

00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:13,630
patents are issued so one of the reasons

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,220
that the quality of carton pet well we

00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,049
think one of the reasons that the

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,029
quality of current patents is so bad is

00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,610
because the USPTO is sort of chronically

00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:23,470
understaffed in the amount of time that

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,299
they can spend examining a single patent

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,789
is pretty short and then they're not

00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:30,340
necessarily experts in that area they

00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:33,669
might be like look like oh you work in

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,419
the software department but the you know

00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:39,159
obviously software is vast and so you

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:44,649
know they may not be a particular expert

00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:49,480
in that section I actually I met someone

00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:51,940
who was a who worked specifically in the

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,399
umbrella Department so like her whole

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,639
day was looking at patents for new

00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,870
umbrellas and and sometimes other rain

00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:04,120
gear so like that they tried like yeah

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,889
yeah well you know like or like how did

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,750
he remember those hats it was like how

00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:10,210
to umbrella on yes so like that kind of

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,860
things he said so so for some stuff you

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,809
can be really expert and then for like

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:21,940
the software Department is a little too

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:23,500
broad so um yeah it's um I think it's

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,659
like the banana carrier where people

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,399
constantly like you know because they

00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:29,379
carry one all the time they're like I

00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,090
could totally do a better job on this

00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:33,190
you know and because it's like one of

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,500
those things like yeah there's there's

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,330
some stuff that there's a lot of patents

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,670
on people are constantly improving it's

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,680
like like it's

00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:45,940
I don't know if you're thinking of

00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,580
inventing one don't go looking though

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:56,200
because you don't want to you know be a

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:58,540
willful infringe so you know anyway so

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:02,160
Elena's the lead sponsor of the Linux

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:06,040
defenders program and so the prior art

00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:09,880
documentation is is a big thing to help

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:14,440
us get rid of existing bad patents and

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,060
it's you know so like when win red hat

00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,160
and nouvelle were sued we did it like

00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,280
kind of crowd-sourced prior art and were

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:25,030
like hey we must know the people who are

00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,310
on all those usenix lists in 1986 before

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:30,310
the Xerox PARC patent was issued if you

00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,110
can dig up some of those old archives

00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,540
and find something that would be super

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,370
awesome and so that was one of the ways

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,890
that those patents were dumped is that

00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:42,970
someone was like oh yeah I totally have

00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:45,250
my usenix list stuff from 1986 so so

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,900
that was actually really good you you

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,970
might find you might think that person

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,360
is a little OCD but it was helpful so

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:56,320
it's that's really good another way that

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,910
we can block future bad patents is with

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,380
defensive publication so if you don't

00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,090
want to like get into the game of

00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,940
patenting something yourself you can say

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,860
like I or my company or my project made

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,460
this thing and we don't want anyone to

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:11,440
patent it so that's basically what a

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,679
defensive publication is and oh and

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,240
helps people write those if they want to

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:22,630
and I can talk like the first of file

00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,820
versus first-to-invent see like you file

00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,830
a defensive publication so yeah and then

00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,530
the prior art actually helps more with

00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:33,490
the novel non-obvious piece of

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:35,470
patentability so if you you you can't

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,570
say like we both got this at the same

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,060
exact same thing at the exact same time

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,740
and then it's still it still comes down

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,110
to first a file but if there's a lot of

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,450
prior art where it's like you know

00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,610
seriously everyone's been using this for

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:51,820
three years then it's like it's not

00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,870
novel and non-obvious so that's yeah the

00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,970
America Invents

00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,310
um piece of legislation that was

00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:00,010
recently passed that changed us the u.s.

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,230
system so that it's more in line with

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,000
the global system so like in most

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,440
companies we used to have like a first

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,240
to invent so if you're all like I

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,430
invented it but you didn't tell anyone

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,820
or do anything but you could at least

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:14,500
document it then you couldn't be sued

00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,720
for infringement if somebody else filed

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,570
on it later but now if you just secretly

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,820
invent it and don't have any you know

00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,820
then your first to you I'm sorry what

00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,430
submarine well it's a submarine patent

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,350
thing is where someone's been hanging on

00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:35,550
I'm sorry so yeah the question is is

00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,630
that about the submarine patents a

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,910
submarine patent my understanding is

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,990
more when someone's been holding on to

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,520
like a patent for a really long time

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,440
yeah they or they bought it off of

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,440
someone else that you know declared

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,090
bankruptcy or something and so yeah if

00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,180
they have like one of those super old

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,550
things and yeah then you could still

00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,620
that's the first to file so you have you

00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,960
get to keep the date with it as my

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:05,080
understanding but yeah if you if you

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,580
have a specific like I'm not not an

00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,990
attorney so if you're like asking

00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,130
because you're like oh sweet i'm going

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,960
to go back to my company and tell them

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,840
that we're totally good on whatever like

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,030
don't do that send me a note if you need

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,130
blake with that kind of specific like

00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:22,980
don't don't try and catch free legal

00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:26,290
advice out of me is what I'm saying huh

00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,580
he's also not an attorney but he would

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:33,600
be happy to talk to you about stuff too

00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:38,890
now he like different things so anyway

00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:41,590
so the as I said Owen has a has patent

00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,450
pool there are a lot of other patent

00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,210
fools and some of them behave like the

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,100
mob like MPEG LA and some of them are

00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,270
like four other specific pieces of

00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,680
industry there's probably some

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,830
pharmaceutical pools and things like

00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,080
that olean is the only defensive patent

00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:59,950
full dedicated to the preservation of

00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,690
Linux so this one is ours and it's free

00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,980
to become oh oh I in number I can talk

00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,110
to the people more about that and

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,770
specific or we can convince about

00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:12,460
patents whatever

00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:14,800
yeah and so I think uh summing up I

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,670
sadly I think the courts are unlikely to

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,650
do anything super great in the realm of

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,030
putting patents outside the scope of you

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,560
know I'm putting software patents

00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,390
outside the scope of patentability I

00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,190
also don't think the legislature is

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,560
going to do it they feel like sort of we

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,810
just dealt with all the you know patent

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,960
stuff with the America Invents Act and I

00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,400
don't know about your your Congress

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,440
people but when I talk to them about

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,330
tech I get the feeling they're not too

00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,140
savvy i also get the feeling the Nazi

00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:47,280
savvy on patents so or they don't care

00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:50,230
the I'd never underestimate like the

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,880
motivation to be unsaved eath at a lot

00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:57,250
of money can produce it's a sad but true

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,030
I went over to Europe earlier this year

00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:02,410
and they were like you know and they're

00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,170
like I know you're just the messenger

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,680
but like why I so screwed up about this

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:11,680
stuff and I was like all right money

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,740
some is part of it and yeah so I mean

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,600
the district in Texas that does all

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,920
these cases they're very tied up and

00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:23,020
it's it's like a whole industry like you

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,960
know they're very invested in continuing

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,700
the system and the all the companies

00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,100
that employ patent attorneys and get

00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,750
their advice on patents from those

00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,480
attorneys those people are very invested

00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:37,240
in them continuing to like you know play

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,600
that game as well so like the like the

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,660
thing is is that there isn't there isn't

00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,840
the motivation and that way to you know

00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,260
to see that like Complete Auto lisha no

00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,630
software patents yet I mean you know you

00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,970
guys whatever or removing it Stephen

00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,320
Colbert to fund it who knows that's the

00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,060
that's the idea I kick around with

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,380
Bradley is that will get Stephen

00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:05,250
Colbert to some form a super PAC if

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,510
anyone knows him personally let me know

00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:11,380
okay and so I'm going to open it up for

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:13,580
questions comments etc on any aspect of

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,770
that these are just that's my email

00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,230
when I mention network and then those

00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:38,630
are just the picture credits so they're

00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:41,300
all yes Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah right so um

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:44,750
so the open if internet where was the

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,670
question is why does the ions defensive

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:49,310
patent pool focus specifically on linux

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,260
and not on the general open source or

00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,480
general free software so i think it

00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,940
comes out of the six founding companies

00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,340
that started oin and that they're like

00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,970
specifically interested in linux so it's

00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:04,670
like it's red hat it's noel it's IBM

00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:09,770
Sony Phillips and I'm always forgetting

00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:12,320
the other one there's one more NEC oh so

00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:14,390
we're not and I know like I do mean new

00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,310
linux on the desktop but it's like it's

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:21,020
linux on the desktop and in the mobile

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:23,090
space so um so both of those things and

00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,890
then a lot of the functionality that

00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,170
works on top of that so like the office

00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,360
suite and everything is also in there I

00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,310
think it's more thing of like what can

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,950
we get everybody to agree to and let's

00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,570
at least get started on that we did

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,950
recently empty the Linux system

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,080
definition to include some more

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,210
developer tools so that like the things

00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,130
that people typically have on their

00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:46,130
machine and are using to create more

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,020
software that is in that space it hasn't

00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,880
gone full blown out to like every piece

00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,990
of free software on the planet I don't

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,350
know if that's going to happen because

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,780
it's it that when it gets fuzzier around

00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,000
the edges like a lot of our companies

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,220
and members have interest in other areas

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,870
and they you know the departments that

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,490
work on the linux stuff or like yeah

00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,490
awesome let's do this non aggression

00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:11,000
thing so we are pretty tightly focused

00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,740
in that way you know it but if you have

00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,310
specific suggestions for specific

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,650
packages or specific areas we're going

00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:20,510
to be updating what's included going

00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,740
forward so like obviously like from my

00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,270
perspective the more things that we

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,490
could get everybody to agree to the

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:27,490
better but it's you know

00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:35,420
yeah yeah and that's a yeah and that's

00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:38,000
on our website open invention network

00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,700
com so I can you know you can search for

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:48,710
specific stuff that did that answers a

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:50,720
question yeah yeah it's well I mean and

00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,220
the thing is is like part of the i think

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,850
part of why it worse is because the

00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:58,520
focus you know and so it's you know it's

00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:10,030
it's difficult like when you know people

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:10,030
want to do everything but yeah yeah

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:35,560
yeah that's not how it said so the

00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:38,380
question is um a could we see like more

00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:40,510
of a like what the full-on community

00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:46,510
participation model instead of like a

00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:49,320
you know a leadership lead sort of yeah

00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:53,470
well we are going to be soliciting more

00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:55,420
feedback and so like it's some of the

00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,800
some of our members are little it's

00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,020
close to there like we don't want the

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,700
whole ravel coming in like you know and

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,400
it's like okay okay let's let's let's

00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,340
start so it's definitely going more

00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,840
towards more input and participation I

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,540
don't think it's going to be like a

00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,450
full-on like you know hippie collective

00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,740
by this time next year but not that I

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,670
think that's a bad thing that they're

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:22,630
great but so you know it's a process is

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:28,420
what I'm saying so do people have other

00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:32,820
questions comments here and then you and

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:32,820
then I'll go over gone so go ahead

00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:49,340
that is so that is let's get let's

00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:52,609
solicit the idea okay so sorry I keep

00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,650
forgetting to repeat the questions the

00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:56,270
question is is a linux defenders trying

00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,130
to get rid of software patents or just

00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,710
let me damage and I'd say primarily the

00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:03,800
limit damage it's again it's a pretty

00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,840
tightly focusing where it's like wow the

00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,580
USPTO doesn't seem to have any idea like

00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,740
what's going on in a lot of these fields

00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,390
and we would really like for them to you

00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,880
know understand what's happening and

00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,170
stop like issuing like multiple patents

00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,410
on the same stuff just because you used

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:22,340
a different term or whatever and so yeah

00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:27,470
it's it's to try and get like redundant

00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:31,820
and vague and non non novel stuff from

00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:33,380
being patents so yeah so that's that's

00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,660
what that's what Linda's defenders is

00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:39,520
doing so does that answer your question

00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,520
yeah okay Glen

00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:23,620
right so the the question is is our our

00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:28,180
patent trolls like intellectual Ventures

00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:30,040
actually making money given that which

00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,470
is 12 billion in capital and they've

00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:36,580
pulled in four billion is it is the

00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:38,230
number you saw yeah well intellectual

00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:43,360
Ventures we know is a subsidiary of

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:44,650
acacia so I like so they might I mean

00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,750
who knows they could be doing like a

00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,880
shell game where they are reporting a

00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,010
loss I'm like oh all the poor employees

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,870
and intellectual ventures are not making

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,090
very much money but acacia like somehow

00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:57,880
God like eight billion dollars in fees

00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:00,850
from them who knows like so because a

00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,440
lot of them are like it's like and if

00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:04,210
you saw that this american life thing

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,130
then you know how kg it is like you go

00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,140
to their address and nobody's there and

00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,600
like you try and follow like so we'd

00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,640
this one's in a subsidiary this one and

00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,470
then this one is a sincere here and then

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,730
like they finally go to that building

00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,430
more like there's a couple different

00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,170
doors with all different you know

00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,550
company names on them but nobody's there

00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,710
and there's a big stack of junk mail in

00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:27,220
front of the door so yeah I don't know

00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:30,130
like it would be it would be great to

00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,440
know more about like why that works I

00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,520
mean there's stuff I don't know I think

00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,620
there's a lot of stuff that we're never

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,750
going to understand like why does edible

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:41,940
arrangements make money or you know this

00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,940
is like it's who knows

00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,930
it's very comfy that they set up just

00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:17,020
two handles so a lot of companies

00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:25,050
whether or not they're making money so

00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:27,370
the Yeah right so the common is that

00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,920
some of the companies that are bringing

00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:31,540
software patent suits are not doing it

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,220
to make money but doing it to thwart

00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,930
their competition and that is definitely

00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,880
true there was like a intel and sirak

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,790
skis from a while ago you see it was

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,940
very clear it was smaller and you know

00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:45,040
the six months a hassle of trying to

00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,080
figure out like who did what like wow

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,850
serious wasn't allowed to ship gave

00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,010
Intel enough time to go and get their

00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,360
own product put together and then just

00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,240
blow them out of the water because they

00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:58,930
had much superior distribution so yeah

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:02,350
you definitely see that PJ I'm Gras

00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:03,970
class thinks that the case at Microsoft

00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,770
brought against Tom Tom wasn't it all

00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,420
about like Who we're really going to

00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,760
shake tomtom down for money because like

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,160
Bill Gates is so hard up for cash like

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,250
that it was more like a shot across the

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,110
bow like see that linux people we got

00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,540
you and it's like oh you know so and

00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,700
that's like the point is that you know

00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,440
they're a lot of times that's the point

00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,870
and that was why people were interested

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,900
in like why do those former Microsoft

00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:31,120
employees work at acacia like or do they

00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,740
actually still work at Microsoft again

00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,660
we'll never know like we go to their

00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:39,540
office probably you know riffle through

00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,540
their junk mail but I don't know

00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:27,620
I think do we know what they are hmm

00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:54,930
okay hmm yeah Wow the specter of Xerox

00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:56,610
continues huh that's an interesting idea

00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:59,280
so the question is can we directly

00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,350
attack with the five patents that we

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,430
know that Microsoft was lording over

00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:10,800
Barnes and Noble and I don't know that

00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:13,170
it's possible I if there is prior art

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,760
like I would certainly encourage you to

00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,990
go to linux defenders like especially if

00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,720
you have something like that would be

00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:20,730
awesome the more prior art there is the

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,370
morphol resource it is and then the more

00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,200
you know more likely it is like oh we

00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:34,890
should check that repository you know

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:38,610
and look on those things so there's oh

00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:40,940
ok then then they settled so yeah did

00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,940
they say

00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:57,189
yeah well there would need to be a

00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:59,469
mechanism yes so there need to be a

00:50:57,189 --> 00:51:02,140
mechanism the the USPTO doesn't do that

00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:03,759
many challenges of patents like out of

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:07,329
nowhere it's usually because of a

00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:10,929
lawsuit which is actually why like a lot

00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:13,809
of the lawsuits are such bad news for

00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:15,539
the free software community because if a

00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:18,969
company that's like in that mid range

00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:20,979
doesn't fight then a lot of times like

00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:22,630
either the company that is actually

00:51:20,979 --> 00:51:25,149
shipping software or the non-practicing

00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,829
entity will continue to use that stick

00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:30,909
to beat everybody that they can reach

00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:33,099
with so it's um so the junk patents keep

00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:35,109
floating around and getting done again

00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:37,659
and again so yeah there would be need to

00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:40,869
be another case I think for there to be

00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:42,159
an overturning I can double check on

00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:43,449
that it looks like I said I'm not an

00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,579
attorney but my understanding is that

00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:48,579
like they don't take solace unsolicited

00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:50,739
out of the lake blew this one really

00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:52,659
bugs me we should get rid of it kind of

00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:57,630
things but if there's an ongoing lawsuit

00:51:52,659 --> 00:52:01,329
then you that's you know a big

00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:08,579
opportunity or the mechanism to kick out

00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:08,579
a junk patent yeah

00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,860
yeah well if Google isn't have the

00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:21,230
wherewithal to fight back in the courts

00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:28,100
then I don't know if the folks in the

00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:30,940
room here are going 200 right okay so

00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,940
where they went on the

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:13,069
wellness esli they're going to spin off

00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:18,680
a dummy company to do their dirty work

00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:21,380
so um yeah you know it's uh it's there

00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,970
are a lot of cases and it's it makes it

00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,680
it makes it really tricky like I can't

00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:28,069
even keep up with them all and I try and

00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,930
read wroclaw all the time so it's yeah

00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:32,000
so there wouldn't need to be a case I

00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:34,490
think to kick out those five patents but

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,609
but the other ones like if the case has

00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:40,220
already come and gone then I there's you

00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:41,869
know collecting the prior art in advance

00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,309
so that the next time that someone gets

00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:44,930
sued we can send them a note and be like

00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:47,059
hey we have a whole pile of prior art

00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:51,109
please don't just like curl up and give

00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:53,269
them a check so you know so i think

00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:54,769
that's that's the way that I I think it

00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:56,630
would be there's not a proactive thing

00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:59,180
unless you want to see Microsoft over

00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:01,519
them yourself which like good luck

00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:09,980
because that would be super amazing to

00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:11,990
watch right right so you know right and

00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,150
so that would be outside of the linux

00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:19,069
stuff i think i mean i don't know what's

00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:21,349
on next book i'm not a gamer so huh no

00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:23,000
no Andrew right this is like yeah so we

00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:26,960
include a lot of stuff on the mobile so

00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,630
it's yeah yeah so that would be you know

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,819
it would be good to see those dunk so

00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:33,109
yeah if you if you have some ideas about

00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:42,440
where that prior art might come from

00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:47,150
then definitely load it up and right so

00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:49,250
we have right right so yeah and there's

00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,769
like a list more like a more specific

00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:54,230
list of what's what's covered in Linux

00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:57,849
system definition and what you know what

00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,849
the exact resources are so

00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,910
yeah and that sounds like yeah that

00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:21,089
sounds like of the same ilk as that

00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:25,089
display system objects kind of yeah yeah

00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:27,400
yeah yeah it's uh it's like good you

00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:35,920
know death by a thousand paper cuts kind

00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:37,540
of a thing so yeah if you have prior art

00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,250
then I absolutely encourage you to put

00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,900
it up like that would be that would be

00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:43,270
great but I don't think we can I don't

00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,980
think we can go after them like just

00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:47,650
with the prior art and get rid of the

00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,970
patents like we would need to there

00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:52,740
would have to be yeah there have to be

00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,740
an opportunity so

00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,510
yeah well in the thing about android too

00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,270
is that some is hardware and some of

00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:09,910
software still ache some of the because

00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:11,230
the software stuff like if they don't

00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:12,640
have the software stuff so sometimes

00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,559
they'll see you on the hardware and then

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,510
we're working more particularly with the

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,730
software patents and not with the

00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:42,640
hardware patents so like so we they're

00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:46,750
not okay so yeah yeah yeah I think so

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,700
too yeah it's like the ones that get

00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,880
settled it's it's hard to know what

00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:54,010
happened there and a lot of times like a

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,190
condition of settling is that they will

00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:59,650
not talk about it so like it's it's one

00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,630
of the things that I always get asked

00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:03,609
about oin is like oh so who have you

00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,920
helped and how'd it work and like most

00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:09,279
of the time I'm like not allowed to

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:13,480
discuss any of ya because that was the

00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:17,440
terms of settling so you know that's

00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:19,089
that's difficult and I think that you

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,579
know like unfortunately that works to

00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:25,470
the advantage of like the wealthier

00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:28,180
litigant in that sense to be like ooh

00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:30,250
you some scary stuff over here you won't

00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:33,270
know what it is until I come for you

00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,270
sort of thing

00:57:41,349 --> 00:58:25,670
yeah yeah there's um yeah well oh yeah

00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:29,240
well perhaps um right so we are able to

00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:32,990
help folks who are members yeah and I

00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,550
mean you know as that as the number of

00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,079
oin members grows in the number of

00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,720
patents that are in that pool in LA I

00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,150
system definition expands like you know

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,310
we start to look like a less tempting

00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,079
target like oh when you see them like

00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,790
they always like crowdsource all the

00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:49,160
prior art and then you settle and it's

00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:50,390
just a big you know we paid lawyers for

00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,730
nothing we didn't even get a good

00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:55,010
lawsuit out of it and it's like so that

00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:58,609
you know I mean I think we'd have to be

00:58:55,010 --> 00:59:02,329
a little bit bigger to be that scary you

00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:07,490
know 22 not to just deflect suits from

00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:09,230
that in that way but yeah I mean anyone

00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:11,900
can be annoying member as long as they

00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:14,240
agree to natsu other folks in the pool

00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:19,640
and not use those patents to troll or

00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:22,160
regress so it's it's not like good we

00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:24,140
know actually know lots of our members

00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,140
didn't contribute any patents to the

00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,270
pool and you don't you don't need to if

00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,250
you did have patents in that area then

00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:32,510
you know we'd have to talk about like

00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,400
are you putting them in the pool because

00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,980
if you're not that's weird like why are

00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,210
you why do you want access to everybody

00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,119
else's patents and you're not fun years

00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:43,310
the pool so so it wouldn't be down with

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,410
that but yeah you don't have to have

00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:48,200
patents to be part of the pool and I'm

00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:51,240
getting the 30 second and i'll be here

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,640
and we can you know talk more

00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,290
afterwards but thank you so much and

00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,920
thanks for the like the awesome

00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,920
questions oh

01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:56,830
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:58,990
way to better utilize all your resources

01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:02,440
and it makes managing all your resources

01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:06,300
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:09,820
happening in open source the

01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:11,620
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:13,720
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:15,700
these are these you know these these

01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,010
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:20,860
discovered and then fixed is that thing

01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:23,860
that really shows the power of the of

01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:26,310
the open source community it is global

01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:29,860
and it's definitely because of the users

01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:35,740
community people are extremely friendly

01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:37,570
and always ready to help if you go an

01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,730
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:42,400
helping each other out and they're all

01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:44,080
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,100
product is transparent for everyone

01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:50,260
everyone can look at the code base

01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:52,500
everyone can see how cloud that is being

01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:58,030
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:01:52,500 --> 01:02:00,610
everything is open in many ways it's

01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:05,110
absolutely vital to the the unborn

01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:09,310
health card stack the most exciting

01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:12,160
event in recent memory for he was our

01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:14,799
first developer boot camp

01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:17,440
and our call gay people adding maybe two

01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:21,400
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:25,630
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:28,420
with 87 people and had to go get board

01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:30,940
chairs in the room twice everything

01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:34,180
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:37,240
is open source and so I don't think that

01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:39,010
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,039
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:44,589
computing and so i think it's i think

01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,119
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:49,829
about cloud computing you're really

01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:49,829
talking about a source cloud computing

01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:56,170
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:58,569
deployments you'll have dozens of data

01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:02,589
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:05,859
data centers these hardware is going to

01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:09,069
fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:11,530
handle number one that mass scale number

01:03:09,069 --> 01:03:14,260
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:16,809
that inevitably happens in large

01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:20,349
deployments started working on college

01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:23,680
attack over four years ago and it was

01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:26,380
the original set of people working on it

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:30,490
had a background of delivering software

01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:34,720
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:38,319
lots of users actually using it high

01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:41,410
availability is the key feature multiple

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:43,420
hypervisors support of different network

01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:46,119
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:48,369
you better while step management server

01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:52,059
can be deployed in different physical

01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:53,710
machines it definitely has a huge

01:03:52,059 --> 01:03:58,690
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:03:53,710 --> 01:04:01,299
there's a major movie studio that they

01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:04,480
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:06,549
to transcode video and i thought that

01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,200
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:11,470
more fascinating is what they did during

01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:14,260
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:15,640
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,339
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:21,740
the instances and go back to doing

01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:23,240
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,130
different aspects and there's no one

01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,359
person that's kind of like a master of

01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:31,549
all those realms I think CloudStack as a

01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:33,799
project is going to be one of the

01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:37,880
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:04:33,799 --> 01:04:43,430
most feature fallen and and robust

01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:46,210
platforms out favor Adam senior living

01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,210
through the clouds dag

01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,080
you

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,479
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:11,429
ago we could not have imagined that

01:05:09,479 --> 01:05:13,619
asterisk would not only become the most

01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:15,779
widely adopted open source communication

01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:17,819
software on the planet but that it would

01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:20,339
impact the entire industry in the way

01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:22,319
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:24,929
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,910
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:29,009
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:30,390
transition of power from the hands of

01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:32,669
the traditional proprietary phone

01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:35,069
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:36,989
administrators of phone systems using

01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:38,219
this power our customers have created

01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:40,169
all sorts of business changing

01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:42,029
applications from small office phone

01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:44,130
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:46,140
the international carrier networks in

01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:47,939
fact there's even an entire country

01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:50,519
those communications infrastructure runs

01:05:47,939 --> 01:05:52,439
on Astra's the gym has always been about

01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:54,150
creating technology that expands

01:05:52,439 --> 01:05:56,339
communications capabilities in ways that

01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,539
we could never have imagined and that's

01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,910
part of what's game-changing about

01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:02,609
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:04,709
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:06,839
IP phones that extends control of the

01:06:04,709 --> 01:06:08,579
user all the way to the desktop the

01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:10,289
launch of these new products represents

01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,390
the next phase indigenous history of

01:06:10,289 --> 01:06:14,789
innovation these are the first and only

01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:16,140
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:17,789
power of esther's when we first

01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,469
discussed our expectations for building

01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:22,079
a family of phones for use with asterisk

01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:23,849
our requirements were pretty simple we

01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,619
asked the team to build the phones such

01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:27,809
that they were easy to install integrate

01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:29,669
provision in use I think you'll soon

01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:32,219
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:06:29,669 --> 01:06:33,869
that goal user feedback is validating

01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:35,969
that when it comes to operation with

01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:38,400
astro space systems including our own

01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:40,979
Switchvox based product these are the

01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,269
easiest to use best integrated most

01:06:40,979 --> 01:06:45,269
interoperable products on the market

01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:47,849
today the digital phones will initially

01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:49,650
include three IP desk phones uniquely

01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:51,929
designed to complement any asterisk or

01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:53,179
Switchvox based solution these phones

01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:56,249
are different for a number of reasons

01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:58,529
first there is clue sively designed for

01:06:56,249 --> 01:07:00,269
use with asterisks secondly we've made

01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:02,640
it really easy to autodiscover and

01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:03,839
provision the phones next we've made it

01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,359
easy for the phones to access

01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,089
information inside of asterisks allowing

01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:09,119
tight coupling

01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:11,109
between an application and the phone

01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,239
additionally we've created an

01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:15,369
applications engine that allows users

01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:18,609
and developers to create and run their

01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:20,380
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:22,329
done all of this at a very compelling

01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,009
price point at Digium we're always

01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:26,109
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:28,690
the best value in business phone systems

01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:30,339
and also give them the power to create

01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:32,380
their own solutions or eating

01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:34,089
communications challenge will continue

01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,529
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:07:34,089 --> 01:07:37,599
Astros cooler faster more

01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:39,219
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,680
asterisk and what communications even

01:07:39,219 --> 01:07:45,390
easier and together we'll change the way

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,390
