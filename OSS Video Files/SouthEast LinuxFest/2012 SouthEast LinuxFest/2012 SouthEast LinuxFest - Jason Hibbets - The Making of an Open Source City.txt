00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,410
source com a red hat project I'm making

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,420
up an open-source city everyone give

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,420
them a round of applause thank you

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,289

talk so don't worry about them well hi

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,690
everyone welcome to Southeast Linux fast

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,160
as the veterans say self this is my

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,840
second year here first you're speaking

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,550
so I'm happy to be here today I want to

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,780
talk with you about the making of an

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,540
open-source city and really it's a

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,280
collection of stories around open source

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,070
and open government things happening in

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,070
Raleigh North Carolina just a few

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,570
minutes down the road so as they

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,270
mentioned I'm Jason Hibbitts I'm a

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,280
project manager at Red Hat my main

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,200
project is open source com we have a

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,520
booth out in the hallway so you can come

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,009
by and talk with us afterwards if you

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,380
haven't already what our mission is to

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,930
basically highlight how open source is

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,090
being used beyond technology and really

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,400
show how open source is being applied to

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,450
different disciplines like business and

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,670
education health law and just a

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,500
government of course and really general

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,960
life you know so we like to talk about

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,180
things like music and video and open

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,420
source solar power and we've gotta hand

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,500
out today about the zombie got the open

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,110
source guide to the zombie apocalypse

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,479
and basically how you can make your own

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,780
food and make your own solar power and

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,770
do all this cool open hardware stuff

00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,070
that will help you survive the zombie

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,689
apocalypse if that ever comes which may

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,200
be here tomorrow so we've got a guide to

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,970
help you get through that anyway really

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,910
what I've discovered over the last few

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,610
months

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,990
is that I found a way to combine all the

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,180
things that I'm passionate about and

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,470
that's open source my local community

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,530
which happens to be Raleigh North

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,420
Carolina and my passion for civic

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,870
participation so I'm really really

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:33,730
involved hold on one second here my auto

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:41,290
time really involved in local politics

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:42,580
to say but how do I cut this off but

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,850
really just involved in my local

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,130
community and so you know I got started

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:52,150
way back in the day with a road paving

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,680
project so I know much more about the NC

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,190
Department of Transportation than I

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:05,500
should and one moment for my technical

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:06,940
difficulties there we go and so like I

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,030
said I know much more about the NCDOT

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,380
than I should but I got involved with a

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,730
thing and it just kind of stuck I had to

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,190
learn all these processes with raleigh

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,540
city government and in the state so i

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,030
just kind of stuck with it and and

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,010
really over the last few years applied

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,140
what i've learned at red hat through

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,820
open source to my local community and

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,890
that's things like starting up a local

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,240
mailing list which a lot of people know

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,459
besaurus are very familiar with that's

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,110
how we communicate and so just taking

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,080
little things like that and giving it to

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,700
people who weren't exposed to it and so

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,320
the way i combined all my three passions

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,040
so it was through this movement called

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,360
open government and and when people

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,150
think of government i think they think

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,190
of voting or lobbying or other things

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,110
that government is not well known for or

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,820
that people are put off by but really

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,860
for me open government is about citizen

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,500
participation and making government work

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,580
better for us and I found found a couple

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,640
great ways to do that which I'll talk

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,280
about today so all the way at the top

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,530
level when soon after President Obama

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,480
took office he enacted this thing called

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,340
the open government initiative and it

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,660
highlights three core principles that we

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,130
should all be familiar with from an open

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,050
source perspective and that's

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,870
transparency participation and

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,070
collaboration and so I like to think

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,440
that they borrowed those from open

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,489
source which is totally cool but it

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,979
resonates with me because i've been

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,889
using those principles for years in my

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,330
open source world and so

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,789
what I've been doing over the last year

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,860
last few months I kind of summarize it

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,389
as the path to the open source city so

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,389
it's this initiative is open government

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,069
initiative in Raleigh to make the city

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,159
more open source to make our government

00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,659
more accessible and to bring in the

00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:46,689
citizens to make them part of the

00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:48,159
process not part of the process as far

00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:49,689
as like hey go attend this meeting but

00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:52,029
actually coming up with solutions and

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,039
creating solutions and I've got a great

00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:56,710
story about that but first just so we're

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,840
on the same page in case someone is not

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,699
familiar with open source I'm just going

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,229
to give a really high level definition

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,990
so we can have a base knowledge of it

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,250
it's really when you use people are

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,379
familiar with it from the software side

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,479
when you're using software the source

00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,189
code is available and you have the

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,379
ability to modify it and to also share

00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:16,150
out your modifications so I'll leave it

00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,810
at that won't go into the big legal

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,699
terms around some of that and my my

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,990
intern this year likes I just wrote an

00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,490
article open sources like sharing a

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,800
recipe and so I think it's a great

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,089
analogy because if you bake a cookie and

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,949
give it to your friend and they like the

00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:31,930
cookie that's awesome they can have it

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:33,250
but they can't make the cookie again so

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,279
if you make the cookie and give them the

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,689
recipe they're free to modify it they're

00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,949
free to make it themselves they can add

00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:40,479
more chocolate chips if they'd like more

00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:41,620
chocolate chips and then they're free to

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,669
share that recipe with their friends and

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:49,509
family anyone think open source is just

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,310
for software in the room no good well

00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:53,110
for me open sources is more than just

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,710
software it's actually a way of life and

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,139
it's it's a way to do things and I like

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,360
to summarize all the kind of principles

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,240
around open source rapid prototyping

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,430
collaboration transparency you know with

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,310
all eyes bugs are fixed all those things

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,110
into one term called the open-source way

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,490
and the great thing is like is I and

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,969
many other people get to talk about this

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,439
on open source com and so one of the

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:21,189
things we like to talk about the most is

00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:26,589
failing faster or this kind of mentality

00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:29,409
of rapid iteration and so failing faster

00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:31,750
combined with our release early and

00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:33,669
release often mentality this is getting

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,500
things out there faster so people can

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:38,649
react to them and provide feedback and

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,680
and it creates basically with open

00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,080
innovation

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,789
and if you like to talk about these type

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
of things and these type of principles

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:48,560
then my brief commercial break is i

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,199
invite you to to join us on open source

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,210
com we're collecting stories about open

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,310
source and we're always looking for new

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,289
contributors and so if you've got

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,520
stories about that we'd love to hear

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:03,229
from you back on with the show so for me

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,910
this path of the open source city

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:09,770
started last year and I got an interview

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,380
with the mayor of Raleigh sat in his

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,650
office and he talks really fast so I had

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,669
to type faster than normal and we had

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,410
the discussion around what an

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:23,030
open-source city would look like for for

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,979
Raleigh and we looked at you know the

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,240
landscape of other cities and you know

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,099
you've got places like New York and

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,509
Chicago in Portland where they've got

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,060
open government directives already

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,430
passed so rally was really kind of

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,470
behind the ball and so we did this

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,820
interview and then we shared our story

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,370
with the world saying Raleigh's

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,840
ambitious we're not quite there yet but

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,389
this is where we want to be so it's kind

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,479
of a road map into getting us to to be

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:51,260
more open source and be more be more

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,520
friendly towards open source shortly

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,889
after I published that I got involved

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,320
with an initiative called City camp it's

00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,930
a national or international unconference

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,229
series that brings open government to

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,949
local municipalities and it's really

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:09,139
focused on enabling citizens to find

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,659
solutions for their city for us it was

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,460
finding using technology to make our

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,259
quality of life better in the City of

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,900
Raleigh and I've got a great story that

00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:19,039
just happened last week that I'll share

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,400
one of the things that happened after

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,419
our first city cam prolly June of last

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,310
year was a project called triangle wiki

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,770
this wasn't an idea that was pitched at

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,329
the unconference or but it was basically

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,260
something that came out of the people

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:38,089
that were involved with City camp a one

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,700
guy named reads the rosies kind of the

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,890
ringleader in this area he had actually

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,160
seen the software called local wiki

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:48,380
open-source wiki platform several years

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,880
ago and he said nan wouldn't be great to

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,579
bring this to the Triangle region in

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,540
North Carolina well it's kind of hard to

00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,339
build a wiki

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,570
as a one has one person right you kind

00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,120
of need a team you need some people

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,889
dedicated to it so he likes to say that

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,959
he found his tribe of people at City

00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,269
camp and over the course of the fall in

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,370
the winter they started building the

00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:12,259
local wiki platform for the Triangle

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,120
area then in February of this year we

00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:17,149
held an event called triangle wiki day

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,190
we had about 50 people show up on

00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,690
Saturday morning including two City

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,630
counsellors and our Raleigh planning

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,420
director and and we created over a

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,670
hundred new wiki pages added over 120

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,339
new images in the course of just a few

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,779
hours really you know we could have

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,130
created more content but this was more

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,199
of a learning opportunity for many

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,569
people so we taught them how to create

00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:41,779
wiki pages which is very easy I like to

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:43,519
think of it as Google Docs you know on a

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,339
platform because you don't have all the

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,529
mark-up that you need it's very simple

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,660
and you can see on the graph here in

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:52,220
February that big spike right between

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,670
februari and March is our triangle wiki

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,990
day and so a lot of people been talking

00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,060
about the basically this type this

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,370
content sprint that happened during this

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,199
day and about three weeks after we held

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,760
this they officially launched right so

00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,040
the triangle wiki they served as a soft

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,779
launch for this project they wanted to

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,639
get to a thousand pages by their full

00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,459
launch which was mid March and they

00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,839
accomplished that goal mark mostly in

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,990
part because of this triangle wiki day

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,639
so on another aspect of this is kind of

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,230
the the community building side of

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,490
open-source right we're building

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,410
community here we're teaching people how

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,760
to teach other people and really the

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,560
biggest problem that we have here is

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,630
people come to the organizers and ask

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,940
permission to do things and we're like

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,699
you can go do it yourself we don't need

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,230
to be part of of your wiki day we're

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,970
glad to but you know you can feel free

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,510
to go organize it you don't need to ask

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,430
permission to do this and this is one of

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,069
my favorite stories this is matt thomas

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,839
ullah he actually he's a grad student at

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:50,480
NC state and unc in fact he just

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,939
graduated in May and he's done a number

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,430
of things he's interested in urban

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,380
planning and he did his first project

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,160
was called city fabric he basically

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,010
takes GIS map data and puts it on

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,779
t-shirts and prints and bags and totes

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,220
and things like that and so that was

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,860
kind of a first business as

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,240
business experiment that he did well he

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,240
did this thing it's kind of been dubbed

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,980
as guerrilla urban warfare and his whole

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,139
goal was to get more people to walk

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,339
right so he walks around the city of

00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,310
raleigh but he doesn't see a lot of

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,449
other people walking and if I think

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,829
Sharla's probably a little bit different

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,240
but you know he wanted other people to

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,310
walk and he thought how can I get more

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,310
people to walk so we put up these signs

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,560
that said instead of it's two miles this

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,649
way it's a five-minute walk to this

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,490
place where you know these kind of

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,740
locations where people might want to go

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,019
these destination places and so you know

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,649
you used color coding green for parks

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:47,240
and blue for for commerce and he didn't

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,610
just stop there right so there was some

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,019
intricacies with the sign ordinance in

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,720
Raleigh that have been resolved since

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,829
since this uses it ties the time here so

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,209
there's no damage to public property but

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,500
Matt basically said he came to me and

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:02,649
said hey man I'm really interested in

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,839
how other cities can do this how can we

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:07,490
basically open source this walk your

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,110
city project so that anyone can print

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,029
out a sign and have some sort of

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,399
similarity and have the same format and

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,589
some consistency and and so he did that

00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,300
he did a Kickstarter project he got

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,839
funded at over two hundred percent and

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,370
now he's pursuing basically how to

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,360
enable people to create these signs for

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,819
their city well then earlier this year

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,850
the dominoes started the fall as far as

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:36,230
on the path of the open-source city in

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,269
early februari the City Council you now

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,120
unanimously passed an open government

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,220
directive or open government resolution

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,439
and so what that did is two things it

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,149
put open-source software on an equal

00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,040
playing field from a procurement

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,920
standpoint so when the IT department

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,600
goes out looks for an IT solution now

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,550
they have to look at an open source

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,649
solution they didn't go as far and say

00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,500
it has to be open source but at least it

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:02,779
has equal footing from that perspective

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,339
the second part of that is to launch an

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,990
open data portal which I'll talk about

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:12,589
in just a moment on the open data portal

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,660
side the city also allocated $50,000

00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,600
towards that so the interesting part

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,420
here is that we're in the budget process

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,000
currently and this is the first time in

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,710
ten years

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,430
the City Council has told the city

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,170
manager to basically earmark $50,000 for

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,850
the special thing normally the processes

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,070
the city manager says here's the budget

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,600
if you want to make changes to it you're

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,430
responsible for make shifting the

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
numbers around well the City Council

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,940
said we need this fifty thousand dollars

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,060
for this project so make sure it's in

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,620
the budget I also like to say they put

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,090
their money where their mouth is or put

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,580
our tax dollars where their commitment

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,800
was then just a few weeks ago Raleigh

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,940
announced open Raleigh it's basically

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,730
our one-stop shop for open data it's got

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,910
three parts to it it keeps the has the

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,150
open data component it has citizen

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,200
participation part and one more one part

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,480
that I can't remember at the moment that

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,760
it actually is a few slides away open

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,350
data sources like web applications and

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,320
things like that so this is a quick

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,440
screenshot of the landing page you can

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,820
see we've got our geoportal which if

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,470
you're interested is actually powered by

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,310
the ESRI folks so they've got a booth

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,540
out here so you can go talk to them and

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,310
the second the middle part is web

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,860
applications and mobile applications and

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,790
then the citizen part at the bottom so

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,580
I'll go in depth with some of these

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,440
already alluded to the geoportal powered

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,070
by ESRI on the back end we've got over

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,560
almost 100 layers of different GIS data

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,080
available for the public to use that

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,950
includes things from zoning to roads to

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:51,420
parks and various maps that people would

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:54,080
be interested in using another part of

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,910
this is called my Riley ideas this is a

00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,140
basically a crowdsourcing platform it's

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,820
powered by a company called Granicus and

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,650
what they're doing now so we're in the

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,790
very early stages of our open data

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,990
portal and the city's being very frank

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,370
and they're saying hey we've got two

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,230
things we need to accomplish before we

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,030
can really put accelerate the open data

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,760
portal we need to understand what our

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,710
open data policy is so we want you to

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,060
input we want to have your input on what

00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,500
that should look like what type of

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,660
licensing should things be released

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,640
under and so they're actively engaging

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,560
citizens and users on what that should

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,050
look like the second part is to actually

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,940
help them prioritize which data to focus

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,500
on to get in the open data portal first

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,830
right it's great that we have all these

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,320
do

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,270
layers that's awesome but if the city is

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,430
going to open source other things let's

00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,260
say the budget is that really a high

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,780
priority from a citizen or a user

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,230
perspective so they're asking us what is

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,640
a high priority another interesting

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,980
thing they did is called my rally

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,750
subscriptions this is basically an email

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,280
subscription management platform there

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,740
are a ton of them out there this one

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,650
actually specializes in government

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,230
solutions this has actually saved me a

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,760
bunch of email right because I'm so

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,500
involved i'd get the same email from

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,810
three or four different people i'd get

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,670
it twice from the city now i can go in

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,280
and opt into the information that i want

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,500
to receive and i get it in a digest

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,180
format or whatever however frequent i

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,890
want to get it and it's been very

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,720
successful from the city of raleigh

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,250
perspective it's exceeded their

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,630
expectations I don't have the data

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,100
behind it but I've talked with the folks

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,600
that implemented it and they said

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,800
they've seen a great uptick in the

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,930
number of subscriptions on the system

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,490
right so kind of summarizing all that

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,500
right so the city Raleigh isn't going

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,880
out and building these applications all

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,200
by themselves they're leveraging other

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
you know the eco sittin government

00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,130
ecosystem to deploy many of these things

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,960
I didn't talk about see click fixed in

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,280
this presentation earlier because it was

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,980
actually deployed about a year and a

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,160
half ago see click fixes an open 311

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,050
platform that allows citizens to report

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,400
non-emergency issues to the city they've

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,990
got a website and also a mobile

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,340
application so if you're walking down

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,660
the sidewalk and you see a downed tree

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,640
limb you can take a picture of it with

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,160
your cell phone it's got your location

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,560
and it reports it to the city what they

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,820
do is they get that information to the

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,490
right Department so that that problem

00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,660
can be resolved other popular things

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,030
that people do with it is to report

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,180
potholes or graffiti or those type of

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,010
things and I've seen a great I've had a

00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,839
great experience with it things get

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,910
resolved within a day two days three

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,770
days there are things that take you no

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,050
longer but the point is it's actually

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,430
streamlining all the process you as a

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,170
citizen you don't need to go figure out

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,910
what's what phone number what department

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,830
to call get the runaround from that

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,270
department or not get a call back this

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,010
the city is taking care of that on the

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,270
backend and streamlining it to the folks

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,780
who can take care of the problem first

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,190
and actually after they deployed it they

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,520
became more efficient at some of those

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,620
things they discovered that one

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,850
department or see me that one issue

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,440
coming in could you actually go to three

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,520
different departments so now they

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,710
figured out that it should just go to

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,040
one department and and resolve that

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,780
quicker and so I just kind of put the

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,520
question out there what other new

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,800
businesses can emerge in this open

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,910
government ecosystem because of open

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,120
data and because of some of the things

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:13,990
that we make available oh I thought it

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,570
was a fire alarm or is that my time okay

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,710
we're good all right so the cool piece

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,850
about this is when the City of Raleigh

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,280
released their open government

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,840
resolution they also released a road map

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,430
with it and there it's a partnership

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,170
with the citizens and the businesses

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,120
that are really involved with this stuff

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,130
and so they've laid out a roadmap and

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,870
they said you know this is where we want

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,180
to take the next pieces and the citizens

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:38,740
are actively engaged in many of those

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,810
steps so this is brand-new stuff this

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:46,410
just happened last weekend we held the

00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:48,700
second city cam prolly ever and we had

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,160
basically it's three days I'll describe

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,540
the conference the unconference the

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,270
first day is more structured Friday

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,950
afternoon we have a panel to panel as a

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,300
government panel in a business panel and

00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,830
this year we actually introduced

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,040
lightning talks which are five minute

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,800
talks that are you know on a variety of

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,380
topics saturday is our unconference

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,120
portion of the camp it's where we

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,220
basically say we're going to have stuff

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,570
from nine to five and if you've ever

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,070
been to an unconference you create the

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,680
agenda right there that morning based on

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,930
who's there and in this picture you can

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,090
see the grid was empty we call it the

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,010
grid but on the wall there we basically

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,710
had five slots with five different rooms

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,630
and we fill that up based on people

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,970
making one minute pitches on topics they

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,150
were interested in and then between

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,890
Saturday and Sunday most people called a

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,320
hackathon we were calling it a civic

00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,320
athan we got we paired up developers

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,280
with citizens and city staff and

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,850
developed different applications in the

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,980
course of 24 hours so we had 10 teams

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,370
compete for five thousand dollar prize

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,380
and the team that won created an

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,200
application called our green way and

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,640
this the idea was really simple so the

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,190
girl in the blue shirt holding the sign

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,200
here made a pitch on Saturday morning

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,970
that said how many of you use the

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,410
greenways and a lot of hands went up and

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,230
then she goes how many of you who have

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,460
gotten lost on the Greenway or gotten to

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,550
the trailhead and not know how to

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,140
connect to the next Greenway and so you

00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,480
know a lot of hands went up as well so

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,270
what they did in a matter of 24 hours

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,270
was they used open data from the GIS

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,210
portal that had the the Greenway maps

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,800
and parking information they combined it

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,230
with the integrated it with see click

00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,270
fix and then they combined it with I

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,340
think accuweather and they made an

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,860
application for the user that's able to

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,880
basically show them where they can park

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,620
if they're going to if they're driving

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,840
to a green hue need to park how the

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,160
greenways connect and they develop this

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,470
prototype in a very short amount of time

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,750
and so they won the five thousand

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,790
dollars they're very happy and I've

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,220
learned just today that they've already

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,660
had one meeting since the since the

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,700
event last week and are going to

00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,400
continue to develop this application so

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,110
where I see all this going is that city

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
camp for me has been a catalyst for the

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,200
open government movement in Raleigh and

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,910
you can see all these different things

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,440
that are happening right we can't take

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,770
credit for all of them but at least we

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,480
can take credit for inspiring or the

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,530
people involved with City camp have been

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,780
involved with a lot of these different

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,460
initiatives where we're really good

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,960
friends with the rally IT department a

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,120
lot of people ask you know how do I

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,160
start this in my city well you've got to

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,500
have an IT department that is at least

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,210
one familiar with open source but we're

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,520
just lucky and blessed enough to have an

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,040
IT department that is advocate for open

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,440
source and really I think all these

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,020
things are leading us to the open source

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,160
city for Raleigh and what does that mean

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,710
for me so there a couple different

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,220
things one it's attracting more open

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,380
source companies to the area that can be

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,730
you know Red Hat is a is going to be

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,790
moving downtown so that's very exciting

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,560
but how do we have other smaller

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,240
open-source companies startups or you

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,410
know satellite offices for some of the

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,560
larger ones that are on the west coast

00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,200
or around different areas of the country

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,710
it's attracting open-source conferences

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,790
himself ah scons those type of things we

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,590
can you know get some of those in

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,780
raleigh we can make some progress there

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,810
we also do a lot of support of our

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,400
different user groups so I know Red Hat

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,920
host meetings for people like our

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,570
triangle

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,430
x user group and our triangle drupal

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,260
user group and other user groups like

00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,750
that that really just need a place to

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,650
meet so they can do their business and

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,630
and shared information it's also a large

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,490
part of it as our culture alright so the

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,990
reason why triangle wiki is such a

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,030
success in raleigh's because we have a

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,710
culture of open source already and we

00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,140
have that mindset of sharing and

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,120
building on each other's ideas and it's

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,360
this whole open government thing thing

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,710
that I've been talking about today so

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,390
that's all I have I'm happy to take

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,470
questions I always want to leave leave

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,480
time for questions because there's

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,890
usually a few in the audience but if you

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,110
need my contact details here they are

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,110
and take any questions that you have

00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:12,860
don't be shy yes so the question is is

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,900
that open as the bus system open data is

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,600
the GIS ism is basically can we track

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,370
the bus right I believe it is and so I

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,280
don't know too much about those details

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,860
but at last year city camp there was a

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,040
lot of talk about putting like QR codes

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,680
and getting SMS enabled message messages

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,420
for when the next bus would arrive so

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,680
i'm pretty sure that that is something

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,740
that we have I don't know if it's

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,970
utilized that well we actually have two

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,830
different bus systems in raleigh we've

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,530
got the local rally one we also have one

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,840
specifically for NC State and it's

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,360
called the wolf line and that one is GPS

00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,590
enabled in fact one of the guys I work

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,570
with has it up all the time is always

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,880
watching when the next bus is coming so

00:23:50,570 --> 00:24:00,460
he can make his connection so I think

00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,460
the city has it as well yeah

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,860
so I don't work for the City of Raleigh

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:14,370
so i can't speak directly to that my my

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,290
assumption would be that or from what i

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,090
know is that the the state of North

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,980
Carolina already uses ESRI and wake

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:23,040
county already uses ESRI so it was

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,210
easier to integrate with the other kind

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,100
of layers of government without were

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,140
already around them so my guess is that

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:34,940
probably had a large influence on their

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,940
selection of that software yeah

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,320
great so the question is how do you

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:52,460
explain open source to officials right

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,760
it's tough right it takes a lot of time

00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,130
it takes a lot of one-on-one it's great

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,380
if you have an existing advocate on on

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:05,480
the council and so we were lucky because

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,950
one of our one of our planners from one

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,470
of our city camp planners is a city

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,990
councillor and so he was a huge advocate

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,550
for us it does take a lot of one-on-one

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,380
time you've got to sit down and explain

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,210
you've got to use analogies that they

00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,270
understand the recipe one is a great

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,860
analogy in fact I didn't I should have

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,370
mentioned this but at this year city

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:28,550
camp we had every single city councillor

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:30,350
plus our mayor attend and I think it's

00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,610
as far as I know it's the first time in

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,190
city camp history that that's occurred

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,170
you know that that's me says that they

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,120
are committed right they didn't just

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,520
pass this open government resolution

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,900
they're actually you know how we had

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,270
three of them actually participate in

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,290
our Civic hackathon on Sunday we had you

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,950
know they're on two different teams they

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,240
presented presented ideas alongside

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,100
normal citizens or alongside their you

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,510
know their citizens you know that guy

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,220
was a lot towards to to kind of

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,500
restoring trust in government I think a

00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,210
lot of stuff gets lost in you know

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,950
everyone we're all working pretty hard

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,410
right and and we don't have time to pay

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,640
attention to all this stuff so because

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,590
there's a lack of transparency in

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,780
government people you know reduce their

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,250
trust but like I said it's just it is a

00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,290
lot of one-on-one time so you've got to

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,929
spend time explaining to them why it's

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:18,250
important why transparency is important

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:20,420
why open source is better right if you

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,410
start off on the technology proach

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,390
sometimes it's just not going to

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,980
resonate with them we've got one city

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,170
councillor who's very traditional feed

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,440
on the street and so you've got to kind

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:32,450
of think about how is how can you

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,610
translate what open sources to a very

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,410
traditional guy that takes phone calls

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,600
on his you know rotary phone I don't

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,250
have a throw turi but you know on his

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,690
rotary phone at home at night you know

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,429
talking to his citizens and going to at

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,830
a door and you know that's how he builds

00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:48,290
his base that's how he communicates with

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,670
his representatives so does that give

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,670
you a good sense or you want me d

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,009
City Council as well

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,100
yeah so the summary of that comment just

00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,600
for the video is you know it also

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,340
depends on the makeup of your city

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,919
councilor if they're not very technology

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,649
agnostic it's going to take longer and

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,059
it's it's it's just it's a hard thing to

00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:35,350
do if they don't understand it if they

00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:37,779
don't see the benefit in it they don't

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,159
see what's in it for them then you're

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,039
not going to make progress and so it

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,419
will take time we're just fortunate that

00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:46,059
we've got people that kind of get it

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,409
they see they do see the value in it to

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,899
be honest I think having red hat and

00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:52,870
then the back door helps out a lot right

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:54,399
so they they kind of see the economic

00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,049
development side of it and maybe that's

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,299
another angle and especially with

00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,370
ideology you know that's you know in

00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,659
part economic development and trying to

00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,480
do some more training and trying to get

00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:07,090
people in work to work an open source

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,860
and technology so maybe that angle it

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:13,019
will help out too did you have a

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,019
question over here thinking no yeah

00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,470
so the question is do we have contacts

00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:25,470
so you're telling me me personally or

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,810
yeah so yeah so the question is did we

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,700
already have contacts in you know with

00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,110
the City Council and with the IT

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,730
department and so for me personally

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,620
because I was involved as a citizen

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,420
before Hannah I you know I've got half

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,190
the city councillors on my cell phone I

00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:58,550
can call them up and and you know we can

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:59,900
just you know talk yeah I guess yeah so

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,250
the question is the order of order of

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,410
things should you go IT first and then

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,910
mayor or mayor the nightie I say I'm a

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,590
kind of a shotgun approach kind of Chi

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:10,250
like you've got a we've gotta work

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,420
top-down and bottom-up right and so for

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,950
me I already had a lot of the

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,930
relationship with City Council so I

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,180
didn't have that as good of a

00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,710
relationship with the IT department in

00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,150
fact when I was looking back and

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,220
reflecting all the stuff one of the

00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,530
things that helped me as the city was

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,380
redoing their website and they were

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:30,470
looking for you know kind of web web

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,390
savvy people to help them you know look

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,850
at previews and give them some feedback

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,220
and so they made a task force around you

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,780
know the relaunch of the website so i

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,040
got involved with that and so that kind

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,430
of helped me form a relationship with

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,480
the IT folks and and I think you know if

00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,220
there's opportunities like that to

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,000
definitely take advantage of it or if

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,460
there's a citizen kind of empowered you

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,750
know group or even if you've got an

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,310
organization where you can ask them to

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,320
come be a guest speaker at something and

00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,700
give an update it's those little small

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,040
things that kind of build up over time

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,450
that makes it easier to say hey have you

00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,800
seen this open source solution I think

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,360
it would be great you know for the city

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,060
to check into and see if it will save

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,470
save us some tax dollars so just you

00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,210
know little small things that you can do

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,580
to basically do some relationship

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,930
building or even just kind of you know

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,310
shine a light on some of the great work

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,510
they're doing a lot of times they get

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,360
they get more complaints than

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,040
compliments and so that's one thing you

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,540
know that everyone can use more of as

00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,370
hey you're doing a great job on this and

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,480
let me share your story for you because

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,670
you know they're they're dealing with

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,770
the whole different world you know

00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,730
they're dealing with the city press that

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,380
you know they've got to jump through

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,990
hoops to get information out there and

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,550
so having advocates in the community to

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,110
highlight the great things that are

00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,110
they're doing is also a good idea

00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:49,730
so the question is around kind of the

00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:53,030
relationship between open source open

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,980
data and how people are trained to use

00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:58,550
Microsoft to access their City too

00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:00,410
accurate so you know we're in the same

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:04,130
boat right we started off and it's very

00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:06,020
you know Microsoft trained heavy in fact

00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,370
I know that I went to look at a city

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,740
council meeting last week because I

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,720
couldn't be there in person and it asked

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,570
me to install silverlight I think there

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,160
is a program moon something maybe so

00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,630
there's some really smart person in the

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,470
audience that knows what the plug in the

00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,160
equivalent plugin is what's it called

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,450
moonlight is a called moonlight

00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,450
something its moon something but

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:38,169
yeah so I know as far as the is that as

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,960
far as kind of streaming video is

00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:42,490
concerned there is a there was something

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,190
in process to change that to actually

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,320
provide a little bit more open video to

00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,720
that but uh our panel last week at City

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,280
camp we had the CIO Gail Roper actually

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,530
kind of talk about this relationship and

00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,090
she she said you know we're starting

00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:58,120
with open source we're moving to open

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:00,580
data but really the end goal is to have

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,900
open access right and so that means that

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,419
not only are we putting the data out

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,539
there but it's also making things easily

00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:10,230
consumable for citizens right I think

00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:12,700
that kind of speaks to some of the

00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,730
Silverlight stuff or it's not just

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,320
putting a big you know unreadable CSV

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,390
file out there so that people can go all

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,789
right there's open data we don't have we

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,500
checked the box on open data it's making

00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:24,940
it you know interactive and it might be

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,289
putting a chart you know making graphs

00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,120
and things out of that data and I think

00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:29,740
that's where the citizens can help you

00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,440
know if the city is going to step

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,150
forward and put open data out there what

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,090
can we do with our programming knowledge

00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,710
and our experts and opens expertise and

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,590
open source what can we do to make

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,330
things better a better experience for

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,480
people right we've got a lot of smart

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:49,210
coders out there that are eager to do

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,950
basically civic hacking and it's just

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,070
great when we can kind of take it to the

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,809
next level forum because our governments

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,260
you know are just like us we've got

00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:01,500
tight budgets and so we've got to be a

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,370
little thriftier and how we want to

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,990
participate in our government and how we

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,120
want to make our government easier for

00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,889
us to use so I mean does that help a

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,179
little bit or I mean that totally dodged

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,179
it okay

00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:34,209
Hey look there's a straight

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,359
so the summary for the folks in the

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,640
videos that we have a most a

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,200
responsibility and obligation to show

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,180
our government how things can be easier

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,450
because we are in this every day and we

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,339
see how easy it is to use technology we

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,740
can actually flip the tables and make

00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:24,990
them advocates for us by just taking a

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,460
few minutes and showing them hey look

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,289
this is really easy to do here's how you

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,720
do it so I think it's kind of that crawl

00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:34,200
walk around mentality and so you know

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,849
similar story I just got a new HTC phone

00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,230
and I'm coming from blackberry so it's

00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:40,259
like a whole different world for me and

00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,579
I had the city councilor who was on City

00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:42,569
camp like actually showing me how to use

00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,400
my phone he's like check this out man

00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,779
and he just showed me how easy it was

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,579
and now I actually feel more of an

00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:49,859
expert I don't have to go read the 600

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,420
page manual just from him taking a few

00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:53,519
minutes to show me lo couple things on

00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,930
my phone because he had that expertise

00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,670
and neck technology or it has more

00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,869
expertise than me and that technology it

00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,549
took a few minutes just to share that

00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:01,980
with me and and just because we were you

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:03,480
know hanging out next to each other but

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,269
you know in summary it see no obligation

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,710
to to take our knowledge and share it

00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:10,589
with them in a very simple way right to

00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:17,660
show them that it's easy to use and make

00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:17,660
them advocates for us any more questions

00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,160
great well um I'll hang out for a little

00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,380
bit if you don't want to ask a question

00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,030
on the on the clock but I'm happy to

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,880
share my open source story with you and

00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,260
it's changing all the time so like I

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,090
said I just had to add in the city camp

00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,090
stuff and the city is moving at such a

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,890
rapid pace now I like to say that you

00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,500
know we may be a little bit behind in

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,970
the open source city stuff but we're

00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,400
going to slingshot pass a lot of these

00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,660
other cities and I think Raleigh if it

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,270
isn't already is going to be a great

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,070
leader and showing how open source can

00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,210
be applied beyond technology so thank

00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,570
you for your time today enjoy the rest

00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,570
of the conference

00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:09,770
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,930
way to better utilize all your resources

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:15,380
and it makes managing all your resources

00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:19,210
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:22,730
happening in open source the

00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,530
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,630
of the community and the speed at which

00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,640
these are these you know these these

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,950
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,530
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:36,230
that really shows the power of the you

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:37,880
know of the open source community it is

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,080
global and it's definitely because of

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:48,410
the users community people are extremely

00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:50,330
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,580
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:54,310
guys helping each other out and they're

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,020
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:00,010
the product is transparent for everyone

00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,960
everyone can look at the code base

00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,670
everyone can see how close darkest is

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,550
being built nothing nothing is

00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:13,190
proprietary everything is open in many

00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:17,390
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:21,170
ongoing health cloudstack the most

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:25,060
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:27,700
was our first developer boot camp

00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,370
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,330
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:38,500
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:41,320
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,870
chairs in the room twice everything

00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:47,200
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:50,170
is open source and so I don't think that

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,940
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,970
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,520
computing and so i think it's i think

00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:59,050
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,160
about cloud computing you're really

00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:05,710
talking about open source cloud

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:08,860
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:11,260
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:15,130
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,830
each data centers these hardware is

00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:21,310
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:24,010
to handle number one that mass scale

00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:27,190
number two it's designed to handle the

00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:30,070
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:34,240
deployments started working on contact

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:37,510
over four years ago and it was the

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,310
original set of people working on it had

00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:43,390
a background of delivering software

00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:47,650
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:51,250
lots of users actually using it high

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:54,340
availability is a key feature multiple

00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,350
hypervisors support different network

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,020
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,300
you better while step management server

00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,990
can be deployed in different physical

00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,640
machines it definitely has a huge

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:11,620
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,200
there's a major movie studio that they

00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:17,500
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,480
to transcode video and i thought that

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,130
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,400
more fascinating is what they did during

00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:27,190
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,570
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,160
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,250
the instance

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,680
doesn't go back to doing real work

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:36,180
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,069
different aspects and there's no one

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,710
person that's kind of like a master of

00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:44,520
all those realms I think clouds stack as

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:46,740
a project is going to be one of the

00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,789
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:56,220
most feature fallen and and robust

00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:59,119
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,119
living through the clouds dag

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,780
you

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,080
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,030
ago we could not have imagined that

00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,220
asterisk would not only become the most

00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:59,380
widely adopted open source communication

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,390
software on the planet but that it would

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,910
impact the entire industry in the way

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,890
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,530
way into more than 170 countries and

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,480
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,580
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,990
transition of power from the hands of

00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,270
the traditional proprietary phone

00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,670
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,590
administrators of phone systems using

00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,820
this power our customers have created

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,770
all sorts of business changing

00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,630
applications from small office phone

00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,120
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,740
the international carrier networks in

00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,510
fact there's even an entire country

00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,910
those communications infrastructure runs

00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,040
on esters the gym has always been about

00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,750
creating technology that expands

00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,940
communications capabilities in ways that

00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,110
we could never have imagined and that's

00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,510
part of what's game-changing about

00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:46,210
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,310
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:50,410
IP phones that extends control of the

00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:52,180
user all the way to the desktop the

00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,890
launch of these new products represents

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,990
the next phase indigenous history of

00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,390
innovation these are the first and only

00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,100
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,660
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,670
our expectations for building a family

00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,830
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,570
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,220
the team to build the phones such that

00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,410
they were easy to install integrate

00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,270
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,820
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,440
that goal user feedback is validating

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,570
that when it comes to operation with

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,000
astro space systems including our own

00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:24,580
Switchvox based product these are the

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,870
easiest to use best integrated most

00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,450
interoperable products on the market

00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:30,450
today the digitally phones will

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,500
initially include three IP des hommes

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,450
uniquely designed to complement any

00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,310
asterisks or switch box based solution

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,980
these phones are different for a number

00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,650
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,060
designed for use with esters secondly

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,520
we've made it really easy to

00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,080
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,760
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,470
to access information inside of

00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,700
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,690
between an application and

00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,850
additionally we've created an

00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,980
applications engineer that allows users

00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:02,190
and developers to create and run their

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,960
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,940
done all of this at a very compelling

00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,590
price point at Digium we're always

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,690
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,270
the best value in business phone systems

00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,830
and also give them the power to create

00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,960
their own solutions or any

00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,700
communications challenge well continue

00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,140
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,150
Astra's cooler bastard more

00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,800
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,260
asterisk and web communications even

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,730
easier and together we'll change the way

00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,730
