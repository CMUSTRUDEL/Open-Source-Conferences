the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,099
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit w wh linux org the

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,380
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,119
the following diamond sponsors in 2012

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,119
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,840
ok hi everybody welcome to southeast

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,510
linux fest one things i want to let you

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,700
know about their our survey forms at the

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,500
registration desk so please pick one up

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,050
and fill it out your survey form will

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
become a raffle ticket this evening

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,489
there's going to be a raffle after the

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,210
keynote you can win prizes the same

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,160
thing that's gonna happen tomorrow

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,200
tomorrow to be other survey forms and

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,890
there's another raffle sunday after

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,289
lunch so you can win lots of good stuff

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,879
so that done David now he's going to

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,359
talk with us and he has his own

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,510
introduction slide so we're good I folks

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,830
a couple of housekeeping matters first

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,830
of all you've just heard about the

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,210
survey I will tell you my pet peeve so

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,070
if you have problems filling out the

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,070
survey you can enter my pet peeve is

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,189
things that self should improve on power

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,350
cords at the tables in the talks so that

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,860
people can still run their laptops all

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,250
day long that is my one suggestion for

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,770
what self can do better also this is the

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,200
pre lunch talk so I know that the longer

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,110
that I keep you the longer I'm keeping

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,570
you away from food and while i firmly

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,280
believe tanstaafl fedora is giving away

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:45,930
essentially a free lunch it's across the

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,549
street at Marshall Park which is the

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,439
cross macdowell street from the hotel

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,810
and you can they have literally hundreds

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,780
of hot dogs to give away and they're

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,580
celebrating their fedora 17 release

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,870
which is called beefy miracle

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:08,780
so real quickly Who am I I'm a committer

00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:12,380
for Apache CloudStack I'm a contributor

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,670
to the Fedora project I'm a recovering

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:20,750
sysadmin and so operation side of things

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:22,310
is is where my true heart lies even

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,010
though I'm working more and more on the

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,010
developer side of things these days i'm

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,780
also a maker a very ugly slide you will

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,250
see no pretty colors and you will see

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,990
nothing that is aesthetically pleasing

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:38,180
and i generally don't like slides to

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,620
begin with so i try and use them as

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:46,010
sparingly as possible so just to give

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,080
you a brief history of open source you

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,160
know open source certainly did not start

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,510
with linux but linux is a is a good case

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,890
study because linux came about as

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,140
someone trying to recreate something

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:04,670
proprietary and we have similar examples

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,980
through the history of open source and

00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,750
you look at things like openoffice.org

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,910
or libre office they began as

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:17,120
effectively trying to combat the inroads

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:21,140
that microsoft office and some of the

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,350
other group where and office

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,709
productivity suites had made and trying

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:31,610
to provide a free alternative so if you

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,860
look at lettuces original message he

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,830
said this is going to be a hobby i'm

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,739
trying to use something like mimics

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:45,410
because essentially i can't run minix at

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:48,739
home and that was his goal his goal was

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:52,400
to replace minix initially that grew up

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,290
a little bit right so so letting grew up

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,130
and started competing against solaris

00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:01,450
and it began competing against hp-ux AIX

00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:06,540
and a number of the other proprietary

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:10,469
proprietary eunice ease

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,920
of course to do that linux had to begin

00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:16,949
maturing a lot faster and a lot of

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,380
companies jumped in around around that

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:22,019
and if you look at some of the the big

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,669
players today you see folks like Intel

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,440
who makes chips you see folks like IBM

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,199
who don't inherently sell their own

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,889
linux distribution and then of course

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,720
you see folks like Red Hat Susa and a

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:41,610
little bit from from folks like

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,650
canonical and they're trying to build

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,680
Linux and many of them are building

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:53,870
businesses on or round Linux so another

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,800
good example is is the Apache web server

00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,669
essentially this was developed in a

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,539
parallel time frame to some of the other

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:05,759
early web servers so netscape have a

00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:09,479
proprietary server at the time and of

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:14,010
course Microsoft have is in the 1994

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:17,550
1995 timeframe of course the fact that

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:22,320
it was free and also the fact that you

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:26,849
could have vhosts made httpd a the

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:34,830
dominant platform for web services but

00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:37,889
at the time and httpd came from ncsa so

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,620
you know there was one and essentially

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,360
the three dominant platforms and in the

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:50,490
mid-90s were Netscape is and a distant

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,190
third was Apache so the default is still

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,580
not going to be free and open source in

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,479
the mid-90s over time we've seen as

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,820
we've seen with Linux we've seen that

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,639
open source web servers have become

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,680
dominant the number one server is Apache

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:13,680
web server number two is in jenks or

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:16,760
engine X and NIS is the third a distant

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,760
third so

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,330
and so this leads me to this premise

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,810
historically open source has been trying

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,310
to reinvent the wheel and while they've

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,199
been innovative and a number of things

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:35,389
they've tried to compete with

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:39,470
proprietary software and effectively

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:43,009
trying to ensure that there is a free

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,830
alternative for whatever that is so so

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:49,580
we had Linux providing a a free

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:52,340
alternative to commercial yoona sees we

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:56,060
have we have web servers we have office

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,509
suites we have entire desktop platforms

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,539
that essentially are trying to provide

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:06,470
an alternative to those non free

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:10,190
alternative non-free software so

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,289
somewhere in time folks largely these

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,139
are companies begin kneading commodity

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:17,660
hyperscale infrastructure's the most

00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:22,960
obvious examples that will jump to mine

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:24,680
from mid 2000s on is google and facebook

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,260
when they talk about their

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,449
infrastructures they are talking about

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,460
the number of physical servers beginning

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:34,760
at the high five figures and growing

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,250
into six figures very easily and and

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,050
potentially formula I don't think we've

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,940
seen a recent server account out of

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,740
Google honestly proprietary software was

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,990
not even a consideration simply because

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,630
of cost and even though things like

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,419
Facebook and Google started out very

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,449
small the things that the folks who were

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:59,240
building it were familiar with were

00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,940
Linux free software open source software

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,580
and so that was a natural home the fact

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:09,199
that it had zero calls for them made

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:12,020
that a an obvious choice and starting

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,250
you know around this time praying people

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,840
who are building these Greenfield

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,660
businesses are building it all one input

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:22,950
source it became the de facto standard

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,660
and you can say yeah that's just you're

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,010
talking about big web scale companies

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,240
and there are a lot of big web scale

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,560
companies but I thought we were talking

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:34,620
about files and so just bear with me a

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:39,479
bit clouds are heavily abused buzzword

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,780
I'm sorry for it I I find myself in an

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,780
ironic position I want to say three

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,190
years ago itself when I was actually on

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,930
the self board I told people that I

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,670
would reject any cloud talk ever

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:56,700
proposed shortly thereafter and I mean

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:59,010
less than a year I started working for a

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,550
company and I acquired a cloud com email

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:06,000
address and and I now it might commit

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:09,930
her on a cloud project so everybody

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,150
wants filed a few people are starting to

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,370
understand what cloud really is so I

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,760
want to delve down into what cloud is

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,920
for just a moment so if you want a great

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,680
technical read that will put you to

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,220
sleep on the plane back the IST has a

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,860
great definition of what cloud is it's

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,170
very broad but it's also far more narrow

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,210
than than what you see cloud being

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,950
tossed around on and it's worth the read

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,040
if you're at all interested in the cloud

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,620
space but dave nilsson has this

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,140
definition that piled is awesome and

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,740
effectively that's on-demand

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:50,550
self-service scalable and measurable and

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,800
those those four key characteristics you

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,990
will find in any in any cloud

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,300
environment and if things do not have

00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,240
all four of those they are not cloud and

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:05,790
that's a good bright-line rule generally

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:09,660
speaking so back to back to our friends

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:12,390
at facebooking and Google they are

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,270
effectively software-as-a-service cloud

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:18,090
platforms you're bringing your data to

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,710
them and you're you're pushing your data

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,690
and consuming others data but that's

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,780
that is effectively all that you have

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,150
and at the same time it's still on

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,370
demand self-service you can create

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,220
accounts at gmail and you can

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,570
aight accounts at facebook just by

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:39,750
signing up and so the they're on demand

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,460
self-service they are measuring account

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,720
they certainly will will provide you

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,880
with some of those measurements they'll

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,710
tell you how much mail you're consuming

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,860
out of gmail and and a number of other

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,440
things and of course it's scalable they

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,339
continue to scale up my gmail storage

00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:01,170
they continue to scale up the capacity

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:03,600
to handle more videos more users etc the

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,550
interesting thing here is that unlike

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,980
some of the traditional enterprises

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,500
there was no consideration of anything

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,130
else other than linux and open source

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,990
tools to build that and i don't think we

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,810
would see some of the interesting

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:26,070
players like like google or facebook

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:27,870
without without open source so now we

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,240
get to the real cloudy party even though

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,279
Google and Facebook are effectively

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,900
running their own internal private

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,140
clouds that are software as a service

00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:40,370
platforms amazon comes along a

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,260
researcher in South Africa who worked at

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:47,459
Amazon writes this paper says you know

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,260
we we can sell excess capacity we can

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:53,490
make money doing this we should go ahead

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,570
and do this and ET tube comes out I want

00:11:53,490 --> 00:12:01,170
to say that was 2005 their

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:04,500
virtualization platform is in and that's

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,150
reports running atop linux all their

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,060
initial offerings until several years

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,560
and we're all Linux they were using pair

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,459
of virtualization so there was no option

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:20,010
to really run anything other than then a

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:21,810
Linux or a BSD there's some stats that

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,250
people are publishing that says links

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,820
has more than seventy percent of the

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,680
instances on AWS right now I think those

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,140
stats are skewed and here's the reason

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,790
you can publish your own am I and you

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,010
can publish a number of other

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:41,000
you know put polish that disk image up

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,800
to amazon and amazon that's not

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,200
inherently going to know exactly what it

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:51,020
is so you can you can push that up and

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,480
that makes it statistics really hard to

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,820
choose from so seventy percent of the

00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:02,710
instances running on amazon or an

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:02,710
official known to amazon as a linux am i

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:12,790
running that's not available am is

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:15,710
that's running instances so supposedly

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:23,200
amazon provided that stat to some

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:25,640
analysts about a year ago so that is uh

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,720
i'm not making up numbers here even

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,760
though statistics are useless so both

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,670
the underlying platform and the platform

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,830
of choice there is open source and i

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,840
would not be surprised if the seventy

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:44,900
percent we're in reality closer to

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:48,860
ninety percent so let's talk about how

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:51,860
successful aw this is there are a number

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,130
of customers there are at least more

00:13:51,860 --> 00:14:00,530
than to customers who spend more than

00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:03,860
nine figures a year on AWS so hundreds

00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:07,520
of millions of dollars from multiple

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,010
customers and those are the the top end

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,870
so think about what that means that

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:16,250
they're that they're pushing revenue

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,780
wise twenty-five percent two years ago

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,390
twenty-five percent of all web traffic

00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:25,640
was going through AWS so a lot of that

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,740
is driven by places like netflix who are

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:34,010
obviously streaming vast quantities and

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:35,330
do everything at at amazon but twenty

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,800
five percent of all the web traffic

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:42,330
period that that

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,730
traverses the net two years ago was

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:48,570
running through ec2 that's a tremendous

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,430
number everyone else wants to cash in or

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,150
at least stop all of their customers

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,840
from leaving and so two of them two of

00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:00,450
the big the next largest public cloud

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,970
providers our Rackspace and go grid and

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:06,690
they did exactly what Amazon did they

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:09,870
built atop linens in and they started

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:12,230
offering cloud services as a matter of

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,700
fact there's only one of the top five

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,470
infrastructure-as-a-service public cloud

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,870
providers that doesn't use Linux and

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,570
then is their base platform so

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:25,610
essentially everything except you know

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,600
the platform specific glue that they're

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,410
doing things like billing and

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,160
provisioning with all of that in in four

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:40,590
out of the five top public clouds is is

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:43,200
built on open stores so then we start

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,470
having cloud software come out and this

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,830
really started about four years ago

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:52,880
eucalyptus was the farther there they

00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:56,270
our grandfather they started in 2008

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,340
early 2008 and started working on

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,850
infrastructure as a service software and

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,650
they released it under the GPL

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,080
CloudStack which is the project I work

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,210
on the company that initially worked on

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,680
it started working on it in 2008 about

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:15,060
six months after eucalyptus started and

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,290
they were largely building in private

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,170
but as soon as they got to the first

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,350
release in 2010 they open source that

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:25,260
under the GPL as well open nebula who's

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,370
another two thousand eight starters is

00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:32,670
another open source platform and then

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,020
OpenStack came along OpenStack really

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,410
came about because people were very

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,180
frustrated with eucalyptus they would

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,700
have equally been frustrated with

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,270
cloudstack I'll stack been the platform

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:48,330
that NASA was using at the time because

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,550
while the code was open sourced the

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,170
development process around it was not

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,040
very

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:59,350
and not very transparent and was very

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,000
difficult for people to participate in

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,480
so OpenStack was born out of that

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,209
frustration and then also around the

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,549
same time Abuk whoa these are the the

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,069
big infrastructures the service

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:16,640
platforms that are out there that have

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:19,640
come out since 2008 every single one of

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,900
them is open source I can think of maybe

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,929
three or four proprietary platforms and

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,750
I would venture to guess that every one

00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:32,150
of these beats beats the market

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,299
penetration for that platform aside from

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,120
VMware VMware has pcloud director which

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:43,280
I think's simply because the VMware's

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:45,320
install base is a little larger so

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,200
here's the the state of things and this

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,340
is what I my the premise of my talk is

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:56,299
that we are seeing an example in cloud

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:58,130
computing we're open sources the default

00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:00,650
people start with open source they're

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:04,160
not playing catch-up true innovation is

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:08,500
happening here and people are not even

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:13,520
considering buying large deploying

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:17,510
proprietary systems it's not without its

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,179
problems you know when when Lennox came

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:25,010
out and if you look at some of the

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:27,110
things like the revolution OS movie or

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,290
documentary that revolution OS

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,720
documentary has ESR telling some guy

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,120
recounting a tale of telling a guy for

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,950
Microsoft that he was his worst

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,220
nightmare and there was a very

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,250
antagonistic relationship with and

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,770
around Microsoft and other proprietary

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:48,860
companies that antagonism has not gone

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,940
away we're starting to see now that the

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,350
only players are open source it's people

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,330
are often catching themselves being

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,059
overly negative towards open other open

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:03,580
source projects and that should not be

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:05,950
the case the in open source when

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,730
when because of the nature of code

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:12,070
sharing and and experience sharing when

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,490
one person succeeds everyone's the

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:19,630
floats a little higher even if even if

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:22,990
not directly benefiting so co-op atisha

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,120
niz a lot better than competition and so

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,080
be on the watch out particularly if

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,080
you're participating in these

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,800
communities for for the competition

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,480
against against another project I don't

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,270
think that's necessarily good for the

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,220
open-source ecosystem or for the

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:43,510
project's themselves negative energies

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:47,380
bad thing we're also seeing some

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,820
proprietary companies IBM's no surprise

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,980
there in that list right because they've

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,810
they've been around in an open source

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:57,130
for a long time even though everything

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:58,570
they do isn't is not open source they

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,250
are a big player in the open source

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,360
world but if I were to tell you

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:07,360
microsoft microsoft is doing a ton of

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,620
things around open source i heard that

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,960
there was actually a microsoft

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,340
representative who came to sell wanting

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,590
to talk about all of the open-source

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:19,240
goodness that you could run a top 20 and

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,560
if you if you saw some of their recent

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,770
presentations they're showing off

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,560
running hadoop on the shore running

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,470
wordpress running a number of other open

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,480
source applications even running Linux

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:36,010
infrastructure as a service mode atop

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,470
their platform as a service platform the

00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,500
real surprise here is vmware because

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,960
vmware has not been a big player and a

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,150
good source and one would argue that

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,520
open source is actually antithetical to

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,200
their future profits they sell eight

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,780
their main product is a proprietary

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,750
hypervisor and yet they were the first

00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:02,650
company to release any type of platform

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:06,940
as a service is open source they they

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:10,780
released cloud foundry as an open source

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:13,060
project now one can argue about how open

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,250
you know obviously the pages are sourced

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,730
but how open their processes are the

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,820
fact that they did this in the first

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,210
and effectively let the next generation

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:25,970
VMware cash cow be open source is very

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,130
telling people have essentially said

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:31,809
that there is no future in doing

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:35,450
something as largest cloud computing in

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:38,630
in a proprietary manner and that

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:42,020
openness is required and not just not

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,640
just open a api's which you know 10

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,480
years ago would have been a shot to have

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,910
open api's out of out of a lot of

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,549
vendors but you know we've seen that

00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:56,929
drive towards openness not just affect

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:59,090
open-source software but open api's so

00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,669
now i'm going to ramble a bit i'm going

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,150
to leave my my contact information up

00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:08,059
here I think that I think there's a

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,309
compelling argument to be made that we

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:13,610
are seeing a shift and if even if you

00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:16,429
ignore the cloud space I see I see new

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,850
software companies coming out frequently

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:22,760
and their products are invariably at

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,520
least open source our open core if not

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,070
completely open source and I so I think

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,030
we're seeing a tidal wave shift in and

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:38,210
the technology culture towards a more

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:40,760
open a more open nature where people are

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:45,169
expecting and demanding that thing's be

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,960
open if not open source and I think

00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:49,940
you'll begin to see that open source is

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,160
the default choice we've certainly seen

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,679
that outside the US there are a number

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,080
of countries that have mandates that you

00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,600
should prefer open source or open Staind

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,230
open source first open standard second

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,980
and proprietary is a last-ditch

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,510
proprietary closed is a last-ditch

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,179
solution to any problem that you're

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,070
trying to solve and we've seen that in a

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:16,040
number of countries in Europe and Latin

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:19,160
America already so I think that that the

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,900
tide is shifting and honestly while open

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,590
source doesn't necessarily have all the

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,990
little money i think that is

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,260
dramatically moving away from being the

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,470
underdog

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:35,640
and that in many ways we have at least

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:38,160
the mindshare to to push forward and to

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,300
make open source the dominant method of

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,580
of getting things done and so I know

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,270
this is a small crowd so feel free to

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:55,370
talk interactively ask questions harass

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:59,090
me disagree with me are you silence

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:02,120
outstanding no one disagrees with me

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:08,100
anyone from VMware or Microsoft here

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:10,740
okay have I said anything that made

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,700
anyone mad maybe that's the problem I

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:23,790
should have said something that made

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:26,610
people mad well so Jimmy wants to know

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:29,100
if anyone's using kvm are you talking

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:33,680
about public cloud providers so in

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:37,050
public cloud providers there are

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:41,340
rackspace's has a cloud in beta that is

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:44,070
running KBM it is not yet production can

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:49,740
t jaques immediately jumps to mind they

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:51,510
offer a kvm they have multiple

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,040
hypervisors available in their cloud and

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:58,200
one of them is kvm there's there's a

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,350
number of others that are that are much

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,550
smaller essentially the the problem

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,290
there is that back in two thousand eight

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,060
you know amazon had proven that they

00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,710
were making money with ec2 and when

00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,250
these people started building out cloud

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:17,040
platforms Zen was far more viable than

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,830
kvm at the time so typically the folks

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,570
that are doing KBM it's a later addition

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,180
and they've already got tremendous

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:28,680
amounts of infrastructure built up with

00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:30,000
was in I will apologize upfront for what

00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,500
my employer has done to the Zen

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:39,390
community I work for citrix and and we

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,040
have at best neglected the Zen community

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,660
there are folks who realize that that's

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,800
a problem

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:47,930
and hopefully that's going to be

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:50,480
remedied but Zen was not that sin was

00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:54,140
necessarily ever terribly mindful of its

00:25:50,480 --> 00:26:00,310
user or developer community but Citrix

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,310
certainly hasn't made it any better yes

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:18,900
yeah so so Zen has Zen does a little

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,850
better performance with para verte then

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:27,070
kvm does with Verdi oh and that's

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:29,770
especially as you scale to thousands of

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:32,020
machines and you're having tens or

00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,150
hundreds of thousands of customer VMs

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,790
that becomes a big consideration because

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:40,090
it even though it may be a few percent

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:46,860
per vm it doesn't take long for that to

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:49,510
add up honestly I find Zen more finicky

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:53,080
as to what it will run in para verte

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:58,000
mood then kvm does with Verdi oh but I

00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:01,120
think that that's that for a public

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,010
cloud provider who makes things work and

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,590
has service offerings out there that

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,110
says you can deploy fedora or you can

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,580
deploy abun too they're going through

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,720
the steps to make sure that that works

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:17,970
and deal with the finicky pneus so kvm

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:22,180
is probably easier on a on a small scale

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,630
Zen is lends itself to being very

00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:30,340
customizable and and while kbm there's

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:33,570
essentially 22 real deployments of kvm

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,520
as far as a software offering there's

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:41,950
there's red hat which has it running on

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:45,790
rail and and Rev and the open source

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:49,690
side of that is over there's also joint

00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:55,260
who's running kvm a top on a luminous

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:57,340
colonel solaris kernel with zen

00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,900
everybody and their brother has ported

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:03,400
it it runs on arm it runs on I think

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:07,540
they're folks who are running it on mips

00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,910
stuff old nip stuff oracle has ported it

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,800
and so if you want to use oracle

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:16,960
databases you have to use Oracle's

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,700
version of zen and the other side is

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,700
there there is a ton of experience

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,850
around then if you look at the install

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:29,400
space that even Red Hat has

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:32,520
they're Zen stuff and in rail five that

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,710
install space install the number of Dom

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:40,140
zeros is well into the high seven

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:43,080
figures so I think it's the expertise

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,590
already gained there and people tend to

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,470
like there is a subset of the world that

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:53,010
tends to like how segregated it is from

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:57,150
the from the underlying operating system

00:28:53,010 --> 00:29:00,870
as well but I'm sure as n guy and I'm

00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:04,710
very much not as in guy I can use it but

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:08,309
I don't even advocate before I really do

00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:11,970
like kvm personally and it's my personal

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:14,700
belief not my company belief at the same

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,880
time everybody I talk to who's running

00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:21,600
this at large scale thinks that there's

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,150
probably a year or 18 month feature

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,610
separation right now between Zen and kvm

00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:32,070
for for large-scale deployments all

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:40,080
right so if there are no other questions

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:42,360
and if there are yes sir I think that in

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,490
the open source space and this is

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,700
another area that i'll say i think

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:51,710
there's far too much competition instead

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:56,730
of cooperation between then and kvm

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:59,760
there's I think KTM already has the

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:02,010
mindshare battle one I don't think that

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,809
I think then still has the install base

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:12,270
and the very large deployments and so

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:14,940
will kvm ketchup I think that folks like

00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:19,200
red hat and IBM are certainly working to

00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,510
ensure that that happens what's the

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,950
timeline on it I don't know they I think

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,000
that you have largely already won the

00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:29,659
mindshare battle there and just haven't

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,659
haven't finished the rest

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:38,820
alright well it is noon that means

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:42,179
you've got 30 or seven minutes before

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,460
lunch starts and you're welcome don't

00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:46,909
forget that fedora right across the

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,240
street is giving away free hot dogs

00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:50,240
thank you very much

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:09,580
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,740
way to better utilize all your resources

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,220
and it makes managing all your resources

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:19,049
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:22,510
happening in open source the

00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:24,370
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,470
of the community and the speed at which

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:28,450
these are these you know these these

00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,730
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,370
discovered and then fixed is it I think

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:36,070
that really shows the power of the you

00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,690
know of the open source community it is

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,919
global and it's definitely because of

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,409
the users community people are extremely

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:49,510
friendly and they're almost ready to

00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:50,980
help if you go on tire see any day

00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,289
you'll see these guys helping each other

00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,690
out and they're all doing it like in a

00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:57,549
selfless manner the product is

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,330
transparent for everyone everyone can

00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:03,789
look at the code base everyone can see

00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:06,370
how close that is being built nothing

00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:11,500
nothing is proprietary everything is

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:16,990
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:20,860
to the the unborn health I'll stack the

00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:24,740
most exciting event in recent memory for

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:27,530
me was our first developer boot camp

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,170
and our call gay people I gave me two

00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:34,160
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,330
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,150
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,700
chairs in the room twice everything

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:47,030
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,000
is open source and so I don't think that

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,770
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,800
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,500
computing and so i think it's i think

00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,850
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,990
about cloud computing you're really

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:05,540
talking about open source cloud

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:08,570
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,700
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:14,960
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,660
in each data center is these hardware is

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,140
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,840
to handle number one that mass scale

00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:27,020
number two it's designed to handle the

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,570
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:34,070
deployments we started working on cod

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:36,650
tech over four years ago and it was the

00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:39,110
original set of people working on it I

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:43,220
had a background of delivering software

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:47,480
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:51,080
lots of users actually using it high

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,170
availability is the key feature multiple

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,179
hypervisors support different network

00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,850
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:01,130
you better while step management server

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:04,820
can be deployed in different physical

00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:06,470
machines it definitely has a huge

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,860
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:13,500
there's a major movie studio that

00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:17,010
they were using CloudStack they were

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,510
using it to transcode video and i

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,520
thought that was terribly fascinating

00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,590
what i found more fascinating is what

00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,310
they did during lunch where they would

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:27,750
spin up you know 50 or 60 game servers

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,610
then as soon as lunch was over they

00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,250
would destroy all the instances and get

00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:34,920
back to doing real work CloudStack is

00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,630
vast it touches so many different

00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,460
aspects and there's no one person that's

00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,850
kind of like a master of all those

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,000
realms I think CloudStack as a project

00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:47,250
is going to be one of the leaders simply

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,170
because it's some of the most feature

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:56,400
fallen and and robust platforms I hope

00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:58,970
they were I don't senior living through

00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,970
the clouds dag

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,600
you

00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:52,630
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,849
ago we could not have imagined that

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,040
asterisk would not only become the most

00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,200
widely adopted open source communication

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,240
software on the planet but that it would

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,760
impact the entire industry in the way

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,710
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,349
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,329
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,400
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,809
transition of power from the hands of

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,089
the traditional proprietary phone

00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:18,490
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:20,410
administrators of phone systems using

00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,640
this power our customers have created

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,589
all sorts of business changing

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,450
applications from small office phone

00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:27,550
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:29,559
the international carrier networks in

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,359
fact there's even an entire country

00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:33,940
those communications infrastructure runs

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,859
on esters the gym has always been about

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,569
creating technology that expands

00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:39,760
communications capabilities in ways that

00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:40,960
we could never have imagined and that's

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,329
part of what's game-changing about

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,030
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:48,130
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,260
IP phones that extends control of the

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,000
user all the way to the desktop the

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,710
launch of these new products represents

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,690
the next phase indigenous history of

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:58,210
innovation these are the first and only

00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,920
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,480
power of esters when we first discussed

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,490
our expectations for building a family

00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,680
of phones for use with asterisks our

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,390
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,040
the team to build the phones such that

00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,230
they were easy to install integrate

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,089
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,640
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:17,290
that goal user feedback is validating

00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,390
that when it comes to operation with

00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:21,819
Pastor space systems including our own

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,400
Switchvox based product these are the

00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:25,690
easiest to use best integrated most

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,299
interoperable products on the market

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,280
today the Digium family of phones will

00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:32,349
initially include three IP desk phones

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,270
uniquely designed to complement any

00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:36,160
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,799
these phones are different for a number

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,470
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:42,880
designed for use with asterisks secondly

00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,520
we've made it really easy to

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,900
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,579
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,520
to access information inside of

00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:52,550
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,510
between an application and the phone

00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,670
additionally we've created an

00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,800
applications engineer that allows users

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:02,010
and developers to create and run their

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,810
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,760
done all of this at a very compelling

00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,440
price point at Digium we're always

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,540
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,090
the best value in business phone systems

00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,650
and also give them the power to create

00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,780
their own solutions or any

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,520
communications challenge will continue

00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,930
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,000
astros cooler faster and more

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,620
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,110
asterisk and what communications even

00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:28,250
easier and together we'll change the way

00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:28,250
