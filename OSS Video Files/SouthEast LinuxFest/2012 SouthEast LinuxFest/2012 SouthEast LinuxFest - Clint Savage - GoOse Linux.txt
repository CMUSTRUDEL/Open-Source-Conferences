00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,899
and i just paid a lot of time in the

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,789
federal projects so if you've heard of

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,979
their door project that's kind of where

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,180
I hang out a lot and I also work on the

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,880
goose project which is the new one I

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,710
want to talk about so I'm going to stand

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,630
down here because there's only what 20

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,720
people in the room and these are all

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,369
spread out and so first off if you have

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,259
questions just blurt them out I'll try

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,640
to repeat them so that the camera

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,100
catches it if you have questions or

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,659
interest in that regard or comments or

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,520
things that you want to you know bring

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,759
up please let me know I'm interested in

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,890
hearing feedback so let's talk about why

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,680
we're standing here in the room was talk

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,180
about goose itself the goose project

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,270
started with a request anybody who dag

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,509
where's is never heard of before he's

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,930
just the famous guy that runs what is it

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,090
the RPM forge in the dag repo and a

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,770
bunch of the things in the in the Red

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,390
Hat community and they're in the sent to

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,880
us community and what he said is he's

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,140
hate you know I'm sick and tired of sent

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,299
to ass well he didn't really say that

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,070
but something close he said anyone

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,200
willing to fund a rail rebuild project

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,540
with timely releases and a transparent

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,549
process and he posted this little hash

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,740
tagging I thought this is really neat

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:13,880
not sent to us so

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,080
a couple weeks later my friend Derrick

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,260
Carter he was actually sitting right

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,760
here and I and a couple other guys who

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,260
are a member of the Utah open source

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,590
community which is out in Utah which is

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,090
where I'm from and he he said you know

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,680
this would be really cool so we sat down

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,720
and we talked for I don't know a couple

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,490
hours it's really fun we really had a

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,550
good time talking about we said what

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,990
would it take to rebuild Red Hat

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,780
Enterprise Linux or something to that

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,340
effect how would we take the source rpms

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,740
that red hat gives us and do basically

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,140
what sent OS does but in an open

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,460
transparent way what we said was you

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,560
know there's a really cool project out

00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,180
there it's called the Fedora project we

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,030
knew all about it because we've been

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,470
participating in it for a few years and

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,390
he says that's probably the good example

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,280
of how to run a distro his fedora so we

00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,990
started looking at it we said what's

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
neat about Fedora we like we like the

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,870
other distributions one of the things I

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,300
liked about Fedora was there's a lot of

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,710
contribution from people just come into

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,330
the community it's very transparent

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,010
people can complain about whatever they

00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,150
want they can you know go work on

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,730
whatever they want there's a lot of cool

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,530
opportunities there we wanted to produce

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,850
that sort of thing as well we also

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,960
wanted to be collaborative and a few

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,620
other things so we started thinking

00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,370
these ideas and from that there's my

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,540
only transition is the goose project

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,640
it's an enterprise linux rebuild project

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,520
so basically is what sent to us is doing

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,220
we want to do it with open transparent

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,210
processes and we really want to build

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,790
what's called the enterprise linux

00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,140
rebuild ecosystem if you will you know

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,190
redhead gets a lot of benefit from this

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,200
actually if you look at it from that

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,760
perspective they actually get a lot of

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,920
bug fixes from sent OS to get a lot of

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,540
bug fixes from scientific Linux we want

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,160
to grow that and that's really our goal

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,950
is to make it easy for people to

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,150
actually participate in this process if

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,130
you're interested in it we want to get

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,120
you on board and join us and that sort

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:03,710
of stuff so of course this is the first

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,210
question everybody asks right why why in

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,320
the world do you build this operating

00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,740
system sent to us already does that

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,630
right anybody have any reasons that they

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,530
think about why we want to do this yeah

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,330
six auto we're going to talk about that

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,330
in a second maybe I'll 70 thoughts

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,280
it's not community around anybody else

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,720
have any ideas okay yeah so the other

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,610
thing is there's other distributions

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,750
that do this not just us we're pretty

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,120
actually pretty new to this we've been

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,140
added about a year but scientific Linux

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,360
has been doing for a really long time

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,090
there's no one called clearos is from a

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,100
company called clear something there in

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,410
the Salt Lake based out of south of us

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,730
there's called clear maybe and then

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,640
another one called ascend dose and they

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,950
started just before we did yeah there's

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,780
lots white box yeah there's tons of

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,790
these right it's probably 10 or 12 of

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,040
them and our real goal here is to really

00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,620
kind of combine resources and help grow

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,570
that Enterprise Linux rebuild

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,850
environment oh yeah who said this in to

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,950
us six thing and so here's here's a

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,380
really cool article this gentleman who

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,210
wrote this from standalone sysadmin he

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,070
said here's the releases so he took rel

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,050
and he said how long did it take from

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:21,200
ralphs for coming out to sent to us for

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:24,410
this is number of days so r l six came

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,950
out in november of 11 i think it was

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:30,680
something like that pic 243 days for

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,890
sent to a six-point game out there's a

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,940
lot of reasons for that here's a couple

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,300
this is my favorite quote from dag

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,670
Weir's no no you have it all wrong the

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,160
scene sent to us means closed the big

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,360
smiley face and and then there's a

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,640
general by name of Johnny Hughes he's

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,710
one of the core guys inside sent to us

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,170
and he says you know the one thing about

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,700
this is we don't really build it by the

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,790
community build it for the community and

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,520
I really like how he spelled by he

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,340
spelled it that way so that was my am I

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,310
very much entertaining note here but but

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:08,150
the point here what is the point here

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,500
and I'm making right it's about the

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,490
community right we want to build the

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,530
community up we want to get people

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,170
involved in building an operating system

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,330
that they understand now if you're a Red

00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,040
Hat user or a fedora user sent to us

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,400
user things like that and you wanted to

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,270
know how a distribution gets but put

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,590
together that's basically what we

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,600
figured out was like what we want to see

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,010
how a distribution gets put together so

00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,030
we're going to do this and we we come up

00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,110
with the cube let's call the community

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,840
of contributors and I want to kind of

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,650
focus on this for a second and

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,850
talk about contributors themselves now

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,260
I'm not saying users aren't important

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,550
because they are they're vastly

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,900
important and they're really really

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,090
important but one of the things that I

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,330
find about projects and by the know my

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,740
name of a Carson Wade who is part of the

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,720
flora project came with this diagram and

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,120
what it duck talks about is how

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,880
community contribution affects the

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,770
actual process and the growth of a

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,840
community or have the direction or any

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,790
sort of influence so down here in the

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,900
bottom of this diagram is consumers

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,610
there's eighty percent of them right

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,840
everybody's just kind of a user they

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,310
talk about it occasionally to other

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,389
friends that sort of thing but they

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,310
really do a lot other than that just

00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,320
using it then we've got participants

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,910
about fifteen percent this is on the

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,120
user side right they're like okay this

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,410
is cool and I want to use this project I

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,550
want to use this i'ma tell my friends

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,590
and I'm going to get a couple people

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,419
involved so they basically you know do a

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,500
bunch of work here and the last ones are

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,930
contributors they're a really small

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,870
group of people in fact our core group

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,039
of people is basically four people we

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,840
have a few more contributors in that and

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,729
I'll talk about that little later but

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,910
those five percent or so of the

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,850
community base can influence about

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,229
eighty percent of the project right

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,340
that's what we're basically talking

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,810
about is we want to open up the

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,830
community to contributors so people can

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,150
come in and tell NC and help influence

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,530
the direction of where we want to go

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,599
with this there's a lot of options here

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,770
tons of things I can't think of that I'd

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,349
love to see other people help us with

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,370
and so that's kind of an idea that I've

00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:58,479
been thinking about for a long time

00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,740
we're really interested in getting

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,440
contributors we're really interested in

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,150
hearing about you know what you guys

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,349
want to see out of the project and if

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:13,380
you want to come help us that's really

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:15,220
what we're asking have you do so goals

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,440
some of the things that we think about

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,479
with regard to goals are okay I've got

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,510
this project has been really cool it's

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,160
been fun to play with but you know I

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,010
rebuilt an operating system okay cool

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,930
that was fun anybody rebuilt an

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,970
operating system before anybody built an

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,240
operating system before I'm on Paul

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:37,360
raise your hand okay anybody anybody on

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,039
linux from scratch that's a fun one

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,529
right how much of the innards did you

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,120
learn tons right

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,459
okay these people are still awake it's

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,230
after lunch I understand I always put me

00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:51,610
at one-thirty it's like everyone's

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,019
sleeping so number one transparency this

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,329
was a really important to us we really

00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,680
wanted people to see where we you know

00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,149
where we are going where we came from

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,779
and why we're getting why we're doing

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,980
this and so I'm here sorry how the

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:05,199
sausage was made that's a good way to

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,569
say it so how do we perform tasks how do

00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:09,309
we get involved and actually show people

00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,930
what we're doing so we're spending a lot

00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:12,579
of time documenting our processes we're

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,860
spending a lot of time writing code

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,240
that's hopefully readable and has things

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,160
like that in it we're not there yet

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,420
definitely not we're failing miserably

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,370
that but a couple things that we do

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,499
really well we have regularly weekly

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,199
regular weekly meetings every week in

00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:29,699
pound goose project on freenode and we

00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,699
actually post those online every week

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,300
yeah so in a little more than a year

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,529
we've missed two weeks we we have tons

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,149
of logs up there you can read everything

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,059
that we've ever done and most of our

00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:47,589
communications are there or by email

00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:51,069
sorry yep yep so hopefully you know this

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,149
will wake you up community right one of

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,199
the things i think about seeing to

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,120
extend to us i think it's a great

00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,649
project i think it's fun and there's

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,389
like a core of eight guys that work on

00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,949
the project regularly and i think it's

00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,139
fun for them until people start

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,819
badgering them right when sent to us six

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,930
came out her before it came out there

00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,860
was like hundreds of people asking

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,769
when's it gonna come out when she came

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,819
out every day i read the list one things

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,529
we want to be able to do is we want to

00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,850
be able to have that community safe hey

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,259
when's it gonna come out we're going to

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,269
say well when you hum hum help us build

00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,949
it right when you come help us build it

00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,240
that's our goal we want to build it by

00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,069
the community we want to build it for

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,230
the community because that's really the

00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:25,449
goal is you know you come and help us or

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,620
if you want to or you just come and use

00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,000
it but you can give us feedback either

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,300
way and that's really the goal is we

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,309
want contributions and feedback a couple

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,790
other goals number one number three is

00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,860
up to date so earlier I showed that

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,279
diagram of sent to us and how out of

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,720
date it was so 120 days is a lot of time

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,999
actually I'm hoping for more like 60

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,949
days and two weeks for minor releases

00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:50,649
but right now these are our goals 120

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:52,899
days four months after they come out we

00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,069
want to come out with our own there's no

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,670
way we've made that anywhere near that

00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,800
yet

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,920
getting there and minor releases from

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,240
six one two six two or six 2263 we want

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,640
to be able to come back in 30 days

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,070
another comment here how many of you

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,900
guys see how fast security fixes are

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,820
coming from Mike sent OS or scientific

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,230
now did anybody see the blog post the

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,450
other day what do you say like 72 hours

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,960
three days I'd like to get it down to

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,880
one day maybe 48 hours at most I'd like

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,320
to see security fixes be in there as

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,390
fast as we can possibly get them in into

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:32,470
the updates repository for can you do

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,880
this is it for keable what we want to do

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,250
is give you the opportunity to build

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,630
your own we don't need to do this

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,250
ourselves in fact if you want to start

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,380
your own project you can pretty much

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,650
take what we've got modify some logos

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,450
and you can do it that's our goal right

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,040
so we want to be able to properly

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,080
licensed it make sure we have docs that

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,990
are properly licensed for you to

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,160
actually use and of course documentation

00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:00,130
I want anybody like writing docs yay got

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,450
one person come join us and I'm going to

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,620
keep pitching you know come join us come

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,460
join us come join us that's you know

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,720
that's the whole deal and number five

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,830
how many of you guys participate in a

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,490
community where you don't get to make a

00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:15,970
decision good come help us make

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,520
decisions too what's that that's work

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,260
yes I understand it does say miracle

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,420
meritocratic flexibility does say you

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,830
have to work first but you get to help

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,570
us decide and where it goes and you get

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:31,480
to do the work you want to do to make

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,920
that happen oh that's your job they pay

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,730
you big big bucks to make your own

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,730
operating system oh

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:47,560
i meant i can open source community well

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,100
that's that's I understand that one I do

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,449
have a job as well I understand so if

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,279
you do the work you can decide that's

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,509
really are five basic goals and these

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,220
are the things that we want to focus on

00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,250
and we want you guys to get involved and

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,569
help us and that's really our query here

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,759
but there's a whole bunch of pieces that

00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,110
go with this so i want to show you our

00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,339
tools and our infrastructure and the

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,120
pieces that we talked about and this is

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:09,040
going to take a little bit longer

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,329
because there's a lot more to this and

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,529
this is the stuff that i'm really

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,829
excited about and stuff that we've

00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,199
written in the last year or so so let's

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:19,300
talk about it first one of the things

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,470
that we do is we decided that we didn't

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,730
want to maintain the infrastructure for

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,199
a lot of the pieces if we can help it

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,540
because we just didn't have enough

00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,129
manpower now we do have some hardware

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,899
and we have some of the pieces but what

00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,790
we did is side it is let's let's just

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,730
use github how many guys have a github

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:36,850
account anybody okay how many of you

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,860
guys like it ok good at least a few

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:43,120
people if you don't like get get over

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,350
that that's a really bad joke but github

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,790
actually hosts a lot of our

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,100
infrastructure let me give you a just a

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,959
quick overview of github because I think

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:56,889
it's really cool and I just want to go

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:58,389
over really quick the other way so if

00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:00,730
you haven't ever seen github before this

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,959
is our organization goose project let me

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:07,029
see if I can get just to the

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:08,319
organization yeah and what you might

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,420
notice here is we have a lot of

00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,100
repositories we have 17 public repos

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,380
these are actually our open source and

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,110
free repos most of them are GPL too i

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,240
think there might be one that is a PL or

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,649
something apache license I didn't write

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,720
all of these but there's a bunch in here

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,819
that we've modified for instance goose

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
logos we had to modify that from Red Hat

00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:28,899
logos because we can't use their

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,110
licensing where their their trademarks

00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,329
so we made our own our main repository

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,680
is where we keep most of our code but we

00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:38,220
do actually have a bunch other ones for

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,670
release engineering Quality Assurance

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:45,550
our website goo Goo's release which is

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,720
our release package our planet which we

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,859
actually have a planet if you wanted to

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,569
read thats planet goose project org

00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:54,879
skane which is my favorite one skein is

00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:57,729
actually the project manager which

00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,709
basically opens up source rpms extracts

00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:02,769
them and uploads them to repositories to

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,839
be built so it's pretty cool and it's a

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,629
lot of fun there and then we have a meet

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,679
bought of work because Derek here wrote

00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:10,269
a meet bought that sends emails

00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,519
automatically for us which is kind of

00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,259
cool so if you're interested in seeing

00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:19,419
that you can check out our online stuff

00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:23,439
we also have 2200 or 20 139 repositories

00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:26,049
over here these are all of the RPMs in

00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:29,259
source form that we've extracted from

00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:32,349
upstream so I'm going to start referring

00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,369
to them as upstream so if you don't

00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:36,129
understand what that means that means

00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:38,289
red hat because they're the ones that

00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:40,509
generated it originally so we have

00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,189
twenty to twenty 139 repositories that's

00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:48,099
pretty cool and we start out all on

00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:49,629
github github does have some limits they

00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:51,849
have I think it's a limit of like 300

00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:55,299
megs for all your repositories inside an

00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:59,279
organization how many guys know how big

00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:01,419
an RPM is or how big they can get right

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,419
so there's a tarball inside of every

00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:06,369
source rpm so we don't store our tar

00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,539
balls in github we separate them out we

00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,529
put them what's called a look aside cash

00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,969
and I'll talk about that a little bit

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,219
later that's sort on our own

00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,629
infrastructure additionally we use

00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:16,479
Python heavily that's actually our

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,639
preferred language of choice you can use

00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:21,789
you know shell scripting or anything but

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,859
Ruby that would be fine with me I'm just

00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:26,829
kidding you can use Ruby if you like but

00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:29,799
we won't take it well actually we will

00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:31,329
but so skein as i mentioned does a lot

00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,009
of things and i'll show you some work

00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:34,839
flows with that in a minute grapple

00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:37,959
which is a get hook inside of coach

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,309
inside of a gab which automates our

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,259
builds to koji which we're going to talk

00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:43,299
about in a second another little tool

00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,789
called repo sort one of the things that

00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:47,529
we've been working on is how do you

00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:50,199
build rpms with dependencies inside a

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:52,539
tree and how do you resolve all of those

00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,249
dependencies to build a bootstrap to

00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,509
actually get an operating system up

00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,919
that's like the hardest problem actually

00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,169
took us about three months to do that

00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,159
for a lot of reasons and if you want to

00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:02,180
talk about those we can talk about it

00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,490
after we also use

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,410
found github to working on github 3

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,179
right now that's their version to

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,829
version 3 of the github API that isn't

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,300
written in python that we interact with

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,160
to create repositories this is all

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,949
automated I don't write there's no way I

00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:19,280
could have created 2193 or 39 RP up

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,689
posit or ease on my own lastly we use

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,100
Koji and I'm actually going to kind of

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,870
leave koji out for a minute we'll come

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,189
back to it but coach is our build server

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,020
and if you've ever seen the Fedora

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,870
project at all go to co GI fedora

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,390
project org or koji goose project or

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,600
goose linux org and you'll see a koji

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:38,660
instance there so let's kind of talk

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,880
about how that works how many of you

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,370
guys have gone to like red hat's ftp

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,570
site where they have source rpms right

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,780
because they're required by law all

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,840
right by copyright law to distribute

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,890
these due to the new public license and

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,170
a lot of cases they're just really nice

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:58,550
about it so they have upstream source

00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:59,929
rpm somewhere and we download them we

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,460
put them into a local data store

00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,530
somewhere on our box and we use a tool

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,630
called skein as I mentioned earlier

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:08,270
skein does a thing called extract takes

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,679
the RPM name in source form and does two

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,050
things one it creates a local git

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,620
repository on machine and a look aside

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:19,400
cash locally as well from that I can

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,070
upload to my look aside cash the tarball

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,780
it does a sha-1 some or sha256 some of

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,370
it and puts that into the local git

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,030
repository into a file called sources

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,190
and that's how we can verify it later on

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,900
it gets uploaded to this local our local

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,510
side cash and then from the local git

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,429
repository we can do a scan push for the

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,920
project name and it will push that to

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,510
the gate repository for us so a lot of

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,000
the pieces are already in place using

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,860
skåne there is actually a another piece

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,410
called skein import which does all three

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,510
of those steps for you so you don't have

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,929
to type all three of those because I got

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,790
tired of typing at 2100 times so we've

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,950
got our github repository and we've got

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,470
our lookaside cash and from that we're

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,610
going to build a source rpm again so

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,220
that we can prove that it's been built

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,600
properly on our infrastructure and then

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,309
it's not been built by anybody else and

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,610
secondly we're going to build binary

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,640
rpms so here's the next slide I don't

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,620
come out very well

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,880
so goose project github there's a little

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,980
hook in there I mentioned earlier called

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,990
grapple and when it hits there it

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,370
automatically does a post receive commit

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,280
hook and we has ever used get to that

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,010
extent it sends a message over to our

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,170
server which runs grapple grapple runs a

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,600
cron job every five minutes and it sees

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,880
is there any new committed packages if

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,840
there are it tries to call koji and run

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,300
them okay so this is step 6 it says cron

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,830
runs 35 minutes calls grapple and then 7

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:46,420
says koji build and then the tag and the

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,180
commit message or the commit Hayashi

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,500
excuse me from that initial eise's

00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,260
what's called a mock true how many of

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,330
you guys use mock before anybody okay

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,620
couple people let me explain what mock

00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:03,160
is anybody try to build an RPM before

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:06,250
okay mock makes it easier it's my

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,040
opinion so building rpm requires lots of

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,800
dependencies right and it basically it

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,990
does all of the environment setup for

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,460
you and it installs all of the build

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,380
route and everything to make sure that

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,600
mock actually that your rpm actually

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,040
works and meets all of the dependencies

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,320
if you did it on your own machine

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,240
sometimes you install things and then

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,560
you forget about them right so macht

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,880
takes care of that says we got a clean

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,320
environment we're gonna make sure that

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,820
all things you install and then when you

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,340
try to run it if it doesn't compile you

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,790
can fix that by making new source rpm or

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,880
in this case a spec file and it will

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,410
generate the new rpm from it so it

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,420
builds a Striga this all built-in asha

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,560
root so it's all its environment then

00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,000
when it does it calls this thing called

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,190
make sources now you can change this a

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,630
little bit but that's the default what

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,840
makes sources does is it goes and checks

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,430
out our remote github repository for

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,400
that particular package pulls it down

00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:59,560
into the Schrute and downloads the

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,800
proper package puts into this route and

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:06,490
verifies its sha-256 some if it didn't

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,200
verify at what we have problem with we'd

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,220
be in trouble right because someone

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,810
could do a man-in-the-middle attack on

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,060
us or things like that so want to make

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,530
sure that that's valid now I've done the

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,990
best I can and configure that make sure

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,670
that doesn't get in you know somebody

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,890
hacking into it and breaking it but in

00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,000
terms of this it tries it's best and we

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,350
might need to improve this and if

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,779
somebody has ideas on it I'd love to

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,080
hear them

00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:29,989
and then it builds the source rpm so it

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,719
does a an RPM build ashby s and build a

00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:35,389
source rpm once the source RPM is built

00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:36,950
we basically done the work to take that

00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:39,830
which that that package from the

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,989
previous slide download it do all this

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,330
and build it into a source rpm that we

00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:46,070
can now build into a package we can

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,559
actually use in real life so from that

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,849
we do another maca root and we build the

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,559
binary rpms from that source art pan

00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,629
that we just built this is all done with

00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,190
Koji automatically it's really nice

00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:58,729
because if i had to do this my hand I

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,809
would cry Thank You fedora for writing

00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,309
this and red hat for writing this

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:03,619
because it's been great one other thing

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:06,349
that Koji does that's really important

00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:08,239
is it generates repositories so after

00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:10,489
their rpm has been built it gets tagged

00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:12,649
and you can have many many tags in each

00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:16,399
of these tags is basically a repository

00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:17,839
of rpms from that you tag the building

00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,519
it regenerates the repository puts the

00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,859
new rpms in it and now you have a new

00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,649
dependency tree that you can use to

00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:27,830
build a new package so the tricky part

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:29,749
here is I got package one I got package

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,129
to got package three how do I get all

00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:33,559
the dependencies in between those

00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:34,820
resolved and sort that out and that's

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,349
something we haven't reacted with some

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,299
actually solved yet we're working on it

00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:40,399
but we haven't got all the dependency

00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:44,869
tree structure figured out yet only the

00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:47,929
build route ok last last slide on this

00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:49,399
this boring right every board or is it

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,830
actually interesting nope it's

00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:54,320
interesting I get excited about this is

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,749
fun for me so another thing that it's

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,399
really important here to note is that we

00:22:56,749 --> 00:23:00,349
have another process we actually have to

00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:02,179
sign our rpms and tell you that you know

00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:08,570
you try if you trust us you can trust

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:10,070
the RPMs that we build so each of these

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,139
different things in Koji can actually

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,059
get signs with with a tool called sigil

00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:15,739
this is another Fedora project that we

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,539
borrowed because we love them and

00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:18,979
they're really nice to us nice to

00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:20,839
anybody who wants to learn how to use it

00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:23,179
this is really alpha software but it

00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,979
actually works really really cool so it

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,619
has two basic parts it has a server and

00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:29,089
a client and the client and the server

00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,919
really never talked to each other they

00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:33,049
talked over the bridge and this

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,970
basically is a way to keep everything

00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:38,950
locked away in like a less

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,299
civil machine and then you only wear

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,220
queries over the bridge and you actually

00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:47,559
have passphrases inside of there that

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,880
are never seen so the sigil admin inside

00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,970
the server knows the pass phrases and

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,860
nobody else does so if I wanted to do

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,030
this I would get a client ID create an

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,830
account all right have the admin

00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,110
Caribbean account and then I'd asked to

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,010
sign it would ask for my passphrase

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,960
which would then unlock the passphrase

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,690
inside the server and then sign those

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,539
rpms a lot of process there but

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,370
essentially it's trying to hide the the

00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:10,960
passphrase from anybody else to get it

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,990
and steal it from you so we don't want

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,250
to let that out once they're signed

00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,750
they're pushed back to koji into

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,380
assigned directory and then they have

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:23,080
the key ID from the from the gpg key

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,340
that you used and then there generate

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,460
repositories again just like they did

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,230
before so they have the signed rpms in

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,059
there and then we use a tool called mash

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:37,150
anybody heard of mash before ok so mash

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:40,179
makes more repositories kind of seems

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,620
like a waste why would we make

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:46,600
repositories if we already have

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:49,480
repositories in Koji anybody heard of

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,370
multi lib multi lives a pain in the butt

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,440
but it's kind of cool at the same time

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,080
because you can build one source RPM or

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,039
spec file and you can get tons of

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,919
different rpms from it in different

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,450
architectures right so that's the value

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,679
of it but what it does is it says okay

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,809
well we're only supporting these two

00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,390
architectures right now 36 and 684 18

00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:09,250
x86 64 we're going to mash them and some

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,590
of the packages in 386 need to be in the

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,419
64-bit repository so we'll mash them

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,770
together mash does it automatically for

00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,840
us and figures it out we don't do

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,220
anything so now these are our public

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,630
repositories these are actually where we

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,760
store everything we mash them there and

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,049
they're inside our everything repository

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,179
because it's all the power pm's that we

00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:28,150
have and that's basically it so if you

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,760
look on koji goose project org slash

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,679
releases you'll see sketchy and this is

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,490
actually wrong I got to fix it it'll be

00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:38,169
60 / beta dash RC number that's our beta

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,570
and then when we have a release which we

00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:43,360
don't have a golden goose yet there's my

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:47,260
funny joke for the day it'll be in six

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,280
thought oh okay lastly and finally we're

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,420
almost done

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,880
punji punji does all the hard work the

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,220
Anaconda runtime used to do to make you

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,500
an iso so if you want to have a DVD

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,810
release or a CD release or a live CD or

00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,180
anything sorts of things punji mostly

00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:06,160
does that it does all the work for you

00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,560
just have to send send it a couple

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,300
pieces of information in the mass you

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,950
have to send it a comp sex ml which has

00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,900
all the group information about young

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,430
and make sure that all the groups are

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,360
set up and then punji can actually

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:22,090
generate an installer CD or DVD from

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,170
that information so now that I've gone

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,800
through all the boring stuff everybody

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:31,330
awake still well that's awesome alright

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,190
so where have we gotten two in one year

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,990
so we started this project back in April

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,730
last year so it's been a little more

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,020
than a year I wrote these slides for

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,730
another conference last time and I've

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,170
added a few to it which it's been kind

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,570
of fun to see the progression of this

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,220
project and we're interested in sharing

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,560
progress with you guys and interest in

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,450
hopefully interesting you in getting

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,590
involved in seeing how we can go the

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,050
next year because I'd like to get a lot

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:56,230
further so currently we have 14

00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,120
contributors five of which have actually

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,250
made more than two commits three of them

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,450
in the room here they're right here on

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:05,860
this side a lot of our contribution is

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,970
in setup and configuration of our

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,310
infrastructure and we're working on

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,440
automating that because Koji and mash

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,390
and those sorts of things are pain to

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,530
set up but you can automate them and

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,610
that's actually really easy and we've

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,830
already I've already done most of the

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,300
work to make Koji automated so you can

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,620
set up your own Koji infrastructure in a

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,150
short period of time yeah that goes back

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,500
to our folk ability go another question

00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,090
on that are other comment on that

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,570
anybody go to the salt presentation

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:36,070
earlier today nobody one person ok we

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,270
wrote it all in salt koji's insult the

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,440
new one I just wrote and it's in our

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:43,330
development branch of the bootstrap

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,010
repository on gap so it's already public

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,180
and that's one of our other goals to

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,890
write transparency you want to make sure

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,770
you guys can see it and fork it so

00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:54,400
please for kit fix it you know bug fix

00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,520
whatever what I did it all in salt like

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,600
two weeks ago

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:05,000
yep wait you gave me six weeks off so I

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,960
did work I did work so anyway so five of

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,160
these contributors are made more than

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,020
two commits please come be with those

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,110
contributors we'd love it simple things

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,910
you can do as an example are we have a

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,830
website that is horrible and it sucks

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,260
it's not updated and it needs a lot of

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:20,240
work and love we have a guy who had just

00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,650
joined us a week and a half ago who's

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,030
doing our logo now and he's redoing the

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,060
logo so you can see up here in the top

00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:27,440
right-hand corner this little blue

00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,870
triangle thing yeah I made that in five

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,100
minutes and that's our ugly current logo

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:37,520
right okay it it's anybody know what a

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,830
skein is okay anybody ever seen the

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,750
ducks flying in a triangle and that's

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,540
called a skein or geese in this case

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,920
right because we're the goose project so

00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,170
that's where that came from but that was

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,640
my really crappy idea and I this other

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,040
guy came up with a bench better idea and

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,640
hopefully in a month or two we'll have

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:58,790
that in the actual golden goose release

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,250
moving on 2200 packages like I said 2139

00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:03,170
something like that that actually turns

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,030
out to be over 13 thousand rpms though

00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,660
because each of those packages can

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:11,600
generate more than one rpm binary rpm so

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:14,780
in some cases like 15 or 20 we're good

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,040
example that is openoffice org I think

00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,740
there's something like 80 packages in

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,750
that one there are eight 80 rpms that

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,190
come out of that which is a fun to watch

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,690
build because it takes about an hour and

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,010
a half and just kind of cranks away so

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,080
we have a lot of stuff in there most of

00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,220
our stuff is attracting github as I

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,170
mentioned before we have what's called a

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,480
vanilla branch and then we have a master

00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,880
branch if we change anything from the

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,320
upstream we put it we put the up streams

00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,850
original in the vanilla branch and then

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,830
we then we modify the master branch and

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,720
push that that way we can keep them

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:48,220
different we can send diffs with a

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:53,330
package or with bugs bugs to bugzilla

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:56,060
for upstream we currently have performed

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,670
6 alpha composes and actually 2 beta

00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,220
composes as well they're actually called

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,200
sketchy kind of like fedoras rawhide

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,490
ours are really sketchy and I'm a little

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,510
nervous all the time when they run

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,300
because i'm not sure if they're going to

00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,960
work and that says our latest TC six but

00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,140
it's actually are

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,610
to now beta does have gpg assigned rpms

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,010
and so everything in our repositories

00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,960
are signed and I meant to update those I

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,860
apparently got behind and they didn't do

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,720
it so a couple of things that I want to

00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,159
point out here one of the things that I

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,600
think about a lot when I think about

00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,450
community and I think about that sort of

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,440
thing is this enterprise linux rebuild

00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,510
ecosystem right we have a lot of people

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,399
out there doing lots of stuff one of the

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,690
things i'd like to see is something like

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,140
this where we have more hands and less

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,279
work because we could do things like

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,710
collaborative and creating documentation

00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:44,750
right who wants to create documentation

00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,039
five times over when basically it's the

00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,860
same documentation may be with different

00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:51,110
logos or even not that just some generic

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,970
documentation what about what about

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,440
sharing of upstream sources like maybe

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,000
they mirror ours and we mirror there's

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,490
right I'll be really cool actually

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,450
because then I don't have to spend a ton

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,770
of money trying to get more

00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,120
infrastructure I just use their isn't

00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:06,710
they use mine building q 8s everybody

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,899
does basically the same concept here and

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,820
we're all building a rebuilding rel so

00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:12,080
why not just do a bunch of q 8s and

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,940
maybe somebody else can with a cool idea

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,580
we can use theirs if we come with a cool

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,750
idea they can use our and another thing

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,789
we thought about was cross-project

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,159
backups although github does most this

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:24,309
for us right now we definitely need

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,700
backup and we'd like to make it easier

00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:33,649
so as I mentioned like 50 times today

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:35,750
join us please I beg I'll get down on my

00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:37,940
knee if I have need me to come in there

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,559
what you need to do any of you mentioned

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,850
github if you've never going to get

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:42,799
before what you do is you go what's

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,899
called a fork it generates a whole new

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,549
github tree for you you make the change

00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:51,279
there's a single change in one file that

00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:53,480
you make and you add your name to the

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,159
contribu then what's called a pull

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,110
request you go on on the line on there

00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:59,270
on your fork you push pull request it

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,159
says is this the right commit that you

00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:03,679
want to change you make sure that it's

00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,409
that modification and contribute min it

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,159
back to us within a day or two we'll add

00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:11,990
you to the contributes on the github and

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,450
you'll be a contributor and you can

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,279
start you know filing bugs or working a

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,020
code pulling down and committing to the

00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:20,179
main repository we give you that access

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,260
right off the bat and if you want to do

00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,010
more with the infrastructure things like

00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,360
that

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,710
we're working on processes and we'd love

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,750
help trying to get those improved as

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:31,690
well so that's something we'd really

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:35,150
like to see but here's the thing anybody

00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,430
want a copy of goose because I'd like to

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,520
see you guys try it out where do we put

00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:43,460
those Oh Derek's got a bunch of CDs

00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,470
there live CDs so if you want one

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,720
there's one over there a couple people

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,710
go hand them out Derek man now I make

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,700
you work we got time so if you don't if

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,520
you don't get a copy here we've got

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,780
32-bit 64-bit there live CD so they

00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,760
should actually come up into a GUI

00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,350
environment we're going to build one up

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,770
here too in just a minute Derek's going

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:06,620
to come into it so there's only ten so

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,660
if you run out I'm sorry but you can get

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,000
it here at get goose project org don't

00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,820
download it during the conference do it

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,770
from the Wi-Fi that you pay for upstairs

00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:20,060
the 999 a night so ridiculous these

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,580
hotels they always want to charge for

00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,810
internet access so I'd love if you guys

00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,730
would try it out let it let us know how

00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,710
you feel about it just come in and you

00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,690
know leave a comment in impound goose

00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:33,380
project or send us an email we're on

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:37,130
google groups we have a google groups

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,570
which is not up there you can go to

00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,030
goose project org and it's there I need

00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,290
to put that up there additionally the

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,190
slides are available on speaker deck

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,020
you've never heard of speak your deck

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,310
that's something that I use a lot and I

00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,600
have a lot of my presentations up there

00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,820
i think i have two versions of this one

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,480
up there and it's a lot of fun to use

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:57,620
that they do a great job did we run out

00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:01,400
Derek yes and I'll burn more if anybody

00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,690
wants some anybody want it's just it's

00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,200
just a live CD you don't have to install

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:08,389
it yeah stick it in and boo your machine

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,850
and it'll come right up with it as long

00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:13,159
as you got CD first and if you don't if

00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,860
you want a USB live USB I can do that as

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:20,230
well so Derek seem to take over now and

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,230
um you can just disconnect me

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:30,550
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,710
way to better utilize all your resources

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:36,160
and it makes managing all your resources

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:39,990
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:43,510
happening in open source the

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:45,310
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,410
of the community and the speed at which

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,419
these are these you know these these

00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:51,730
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:54,580
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,550
that really shows the power of the of

00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,030
the open source community it is global

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:03,550
and it's definitely because of the users

00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:09,550
community people are extremely friendly

00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:11,260
and always ready to help if you go on

00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,450
tire see any day you'll see these guys

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,090
helping each other out and they're all

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,800
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,790
product is transparent for everyone

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,010
everyone can look at the code base

00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:26,220
everyone can see how close that is being

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:31,720
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:34,390
everything is open in many ways it's

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:38,800
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:43,030
health CloudStack the most exciting

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,840
event in recent memory for me was our

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:48,480
first developer boot camp

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,150
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,110
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:59,280
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:02,130
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,650
chairs in the room twice everything

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,890
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:10,950
is open source and so I don't think that

00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,720
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,750
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,300
computing and so i think it's i think

00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,830
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,940
about cloud computing you're really

00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:26,490
talking about open source cloud

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:29,520
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,650
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,940
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:38,610
in each data centers these hardware is

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,090
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:44,790
to handle number one that mass scale

00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,970
number two it's designed to handle the

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,520
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:54,060
deployments started working on cog

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,300
attack over four years ago and it was

00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,640
the original set of people working right

00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,750
I had a background of delivering

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,330
software telcos and service providers

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:11,030
lots of QA lots of users actually using

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:14,790
it high availability is a key feature

00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:16,770
multiple hypervisors support different

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,560
network models we can pick up whatever

00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,630
suits you better while step management

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,350
server can be deployed in different

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,940
physical machines it definitely has a

00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,550
huge footprint it's being deployed

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:34,380
everywhere there's a major movie studio

00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:37,950
that they were using cloudstack they

00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,480
were using it to transcode video and i

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,460
thought that was terribly fascinating

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,530
what i found more fascinating is what

00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:47,250
they did during lunch where they would

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,720
spin up you know 50 or 60 game servers

00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,180
then as soon as lunch was over they

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,950
would

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:55,089
all the instances and go back to doing

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:56,710
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:58,809
so many different aspects and there's no

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:01,180
one person that's kind of like a master

00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:05,290
of all those realms I think cloudstack

00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,510
as a project is going to be one of the

00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:11,589
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:16,839
most feature Follin and and robust

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:19,920
platforms out they learn I don't see

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,920
your living through the clouds dag

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,560
you

00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,850
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,800
ago we could not have imagined that

00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:18,020
asterisk would not only become the most

00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,150
widely adopted open source communication

00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,190
software on the planet but that it would

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,710
impact the entire industry in the way

00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,690
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:29,300
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,280
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,350
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,760
transition of power from the hands of

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,040
the traditional proprietary phone

00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,440
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,360
administrators of phone systems using

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,590
this power our customers have created

00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,540
all sorts of business changing

00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,400
applications from small office phone

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,920
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,510
to international carrier networks in

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,310
fact there's even an entire country

00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,890
those communications infrastructure runs

00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,810
on esters the gym has always been about

00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,550
creating technology that expands

00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,710
communications capabilities in ways that

00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,910
we could never have imagined and that's

00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:04,310
part of what's game-changing about

00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,980
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:09,080
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,210
IP phones that extends control of the

00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,950
user all the way to the desktop the

00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,660
launch of these new products represents

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,760
the next phase indigenous history of

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,160
innovation these are the first and only

00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,510
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,190
power of esther's when we first

00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,840
discussed our expectations for building

00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,450
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,220
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,990
asked the team to build the phones such

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,180
that they were easy to install integrate

00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,040
provision in use I think you'll soon

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,590
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,240
that goal user feedback is validating

00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,340
that when it comes to operation with

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,770
asher space systems including our own

00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,350
Switchvox based product these are the

00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,640
easiest to use best integrated most

00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,250
interoperable products on the market

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,220
today the Digium family of phones will

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,330
initially include three IP des hommes

00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,220
uniquely designed to complement any

00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,110
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,780
these phones are different for a number

00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:02,420
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,860
designed for use with esters secondly

00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,470
we've made it really easy to

00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,850
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,950
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,900
to access information inside of asterisk

00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,829
allowing tight coupling between an

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,469
application and

00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:17,630
phone additionally we've created an

00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:19,759
applications engine that allows users

00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,969
and developers to create and run their

00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:24,739
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:26,719
done all of this at a very compelling

00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:28,369
price point at Digium we're always

00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,469
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,019
the best value in business phone systems

00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,609
and also give them the power to create

00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:36,739
their own solutions or any

00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,479
communications challenge well continue

00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:39,890
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,930
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,579
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,039
asterisk employed communications even

00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:49,150
easier and together we'll change the way

00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,150
