the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,410

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,609
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,439
linux fest visit WWDC linux org the

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,010
the following diamond sponsors in 2012

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,429
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:32,969
there we go thank you all for coming out

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:36,690
this is my first time itself and really

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:40,469
impressed so far this is a session on

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,730
the very basics of MySQL there's at

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,940
least two people in here who probably

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,329
are going to be bored senseless

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,670
hopefully bored senseless mysql is there

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,500
was popular database on the web and this

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,449
is your session so if you have any

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,370
questions please shot them out we'll

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,890
bring it up this is to teach you all you

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,559
need to know how to install it get it

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,880
running shut it down and start becoming

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:10,200
a DBA first thing is it's pronounced my

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:14,159
SQL not my sequel some folks are very

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,240
touchy about this I'm not man over here

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,159
not any said will tell you there are

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,369
some old-timers who are very very touchy

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,530
about this this is our agenda we're

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,720
going to talk about installation

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:28,140
starting stopping how you connect to a

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,850
mysql instance loading data a little bit

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,549
looking at data it's kind of hard to go

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,000
into SQL structured query language at

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,590
any depth in an hour session a little

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,560
bit on backing up data because if you've

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,540
never lost data it's a real experience a

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,060
little bit on how the login

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,210
authentication system works where to go

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,619
from here and some suggestions and we'll

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,149
have a formal question answer at the end

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,009
but any time during this you have a

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,570
question this is your session for you to

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,729
learn so please do that if you need me

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,770
I'm David Stokes at oracle.com on

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,890
twitter i'm at stoker i'm always

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:11,040
blogging on planet mask you'll calm so

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:13,180
i'm fairly easy to reach ok installation

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,010
how many of you are brand new never

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,190
installed a package on in Linux box

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,650
before okay so we can skip over that

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,690
pretty well if you're shy catch me later

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,980
I can show you how to do that I know

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,130
there's some of them some of you were

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,580
shy okay normally for the Linux world

00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,739
you either want on RPM or a Deb or you

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,840
want to use the binary installations in

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,940
the windows world we have a wonderful

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,370
windows installer I know that's academic

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,080
for most of the folks here and if worse

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,550
comes to worse or you're just very very

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,860
curious we have source code now I

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,519
recommend rather than going to your

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:55,840
distros download going straight to dev

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,730
my SQL calm why is that well Juicy it's

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,430
a little more updated we're on top of

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,870
some of the more recent patches we also

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,620
build things with a little bit better

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:09,970
debuggers well better compilers then the

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,220
distros do and also the distros tend to

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,620
lag a couple days at best because the

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,880
volunteers doing the buildings where we

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,380
have paid professionals who are keeping

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:26,890
things up to date so those who have

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:28,329
never seen this apt-get or RPM well by

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,980
the way all these slides are on going to

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:34,030
be on slideshare net as soon as i can

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,100
get some bandwidth to install them under

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,810
slideshare net / Dave Stokes

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,799
presentations or I can put them on a

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,359
thumb drive for you matter of fact I

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,519
have some fun guys and other stuff to

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:50,769
give away later now the way I usually

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,980
tell people to install things is using

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:58,959
the binary installation how much linux

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,880
admin work time do you folks have under

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,690
your belts are you kind of brand new at

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,739
it or you're kind of old hats at it or

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,700
anyone reading any of these commands up

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,470
here going what in the world is that

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,930
okay since most you look kind of bored

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,570
with this this is the procedure and how

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,400
to install it with binary zits very well

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,590
documented with the tarball that comes

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,490
with it it's also well documented on

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,770
the mysql documentation if you're shy

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,470
and this is all gibberish to you come

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,870
see me later we'll get this running show

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,300
you what it all means now there's a

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,130
couple gotchas in here the first thing

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,710
is under the support directory we have

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,979
some configuration files currently

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,740
they're kind of outdated a big system

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:47,290
meaning huge system is for gigs of

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,870
memory I doubt if anyone in here as a

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,960
iphone with less than four gigs of

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,870
memory so these files have an aged well

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,190
and you may have want to tailor them to

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,650
get better performance out of your

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,830
system and if you don't have a

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,310
configuration file mysql the daemon will

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:09,550
start up and it will use some pre-built

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:20,560
pre configuration settings that aren't

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:22,780
great if you're just starting off use it

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,770
with the distro if you want to become a

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,860
reduction DBA i recommend going this way

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,789
if its mission critical and you're just

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,830
really need to support it needs the

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,810
latest and greatest go with the what we

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,160
give you if you're ruining it for

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,599
yourself go with what the distro has so

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,010
if you decide later to take it off you

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:48,849
can just do you know our PM minus e or f

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:53,700
get remove but for the mission critical

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,700
stuff please do it the way i showed you

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,160
ok usually mysql is started with a

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,070
rapper called MySQL d underscore safe

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,940
and you pass it the user that you

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,099
install mysql as if you haven't learned

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,620
you don't want various processes running

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,300
as root unattended on your box there's

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,130
other sessions around here that will

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,770
tell you security reasons why you don't

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,000
want to do that but most people see this

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,950
wrapper and they never pay any attention

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,690
to it and they don't realize that

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,840
underneath it's actually running a

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,659
program called mysqld we'll talk a

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,440
little bit about that later if you don't

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,090
want to start the binary by hand

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,780
most linux boxes either have the anit d

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:43,450
or the service constructs to start up

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:47,250
the software yes sir you would run that

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,250
as yes

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:54,070
yeah most people run it as mysql that's

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:59,860
just kind of the general default but you

00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:04,270
can run it under anybody so that rappers

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,910
running a mysql demon and if you want to

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:09,100
type it out by hand i used to do this

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,729
all the time wherever your install

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,139
directory is minus use your equals mysql

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,960
and when it starts up it will try

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:20,260
looking for a configuration file usually

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,120
under at sea or SC mysql and these are

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,289
the files i mentioned earlier have an

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,300
aged well just giving you pointers so

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,680
that when things start changing in the

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,650
future and you start running more and

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,060
more mysql you'll know where to look for

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:39,010
things when you start it up now on the

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,690
right hand side well it showed up a lot

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,750
better than I thought you can see how

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,289
the configuration file is partitioned

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,810
out the various sections are in these

00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,729
square brackets and there's this one has

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,580
one for the client one for just general

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,500
MySQL programs and one for the daemon

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,849
here we're setting it to go to the

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:04,750
default port which is 3 cos 3306 in the

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:06,310
old days a lot of folks would put things

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,590
on the command line when they start up

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,720
mask UL which is real great till they go

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,680
on vacation and someone else has to

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,139
restart everything and they don't

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,320
remember all the switches so as you

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,910
change things or you add features make

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,550
sure you put them in your configuration

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,410
file that way you don't have to tax your

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,360
memory as much and other folks come on

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,919
behind you and get things running the

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,590
way you used to do it when you go on

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,849
vacation and you can also add it to your

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,849
favorite change control program

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:47,350
just a little bit there might be another

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:49,780
session later today another great thing

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,340
to do if you want to play with the

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,590
changing the stuff but you don't want to

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,720
play with VI or you don't want to do

00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:00,700
that Chuck are you have any session on

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,200
workbench later not workbench itself we

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,640
also have a free tool called workbench

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,570
that will let you go through and and

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,910
change some of this stuff so there's 20

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:17,380
ways to skin a cat how many on skin cats

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:20,050
do you want once again the configuration

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:25,600
file is broken up into sections I can

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,950
see client mysql and the daemon usually

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,180
the stuff under mysqld is what you're

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,700
going to be looking for further all the

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,700
various stuff running in the main server

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,420
you'll also see sections in there for

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,880
odd programs like my I Sam check and all

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,960
that you probably won't get into as a

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:47,740
beginner okay now that you got it

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,080
running how do you stop it well you can

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,650
always do the ctrl Alt Delete on the box

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,430
which not recommended you do the service

00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:59,710
mysql stop the init d stop or my

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,730
favorite is run the mysqladmin program

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,470
to run shut down databases keep a lot of

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,930
files open in memory and if you do a

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,430
hard shutdown some of the stuff won't be

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,810
flushed out to disk and the next time

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,990
you go to run it you might be missing

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:16,840
data so make sure always always always

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:25,530
when possible to bring down your mysql

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:25,530
server as neatly as possible yes sir

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,200
it could be rude or could be another

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,910
privileged user as a general user you

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,260
normally don't have shut down privileged

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,250
privileged we'll talk about the

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:43,700
privilege is a little bit later yeah but

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,960
you don't want Joe Joe Schmo getting on

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:53,720
your box and shutting down your server

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:54,980
during the Middle today it depends on

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,279
how you set it up but usually not

00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:02,029
usually you want to run something like

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,850
this okay so you have it running and

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:07,610
bring it up you can bring it down how do

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,950
I actually get to the database well we

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,770
have a MySQL client program called

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,589
cleverly mysql and you give it a

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:20,360
database name now the second example

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:23,990
there we're showing you how you can pass

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,270
a username and a password to get to the

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,800
database if you don't give it a database

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,390
will collect to the server but it will

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,410
not have a database at the other end

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:35,839
waiting to talk to you now the third

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,910
example down here is an example of how

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,089
you can load data so here we're running

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,459
mysql to DB underscore name we're

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,110
reading from a file called script SQL

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:50,709
and we're throwing the output to another

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,709
tape to another file on standard out

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,600
well since we tend to call to so many

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,000
things MySQL people tend to get confused

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,650
between the client program which what

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,170
we're using here and the server now if

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,089
your database instance is on another

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,790
machine you have to tell it how to get

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,550
there with either the minus minus host

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,100
equals host name which can be a fully

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:20,900
qualified name it could be the IP

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:24,250
address or the minus H host the two

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,250
commands are equivalent

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,089
okay so once you connect what do you see

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,720
well if everything goes right you're

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,800
going to see a splash like this and our

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,130
ways to get rid of that if you don't

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:45,170
want your user seeing that they'll tell

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:47,440
you what your connection is the version

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:51,320
that you're running the lovely

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:56,269
copyrighted Oracle message and the

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,570
general my SQL prompt so if you have a

00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:00,860
user says I can't talk to this database

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,360
and you connect to that machine you

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,060
should see something like this if you

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:09,279
don't you might need to see the services

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,279
running or if the network's even there

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,360
so if you do a /s after you get things

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,190
running you'll get a whole bunch of

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,590
information once again we'll get our

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,580
connection ID we connected to the

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:31,050
database world this is our current user

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,580
when you have users that log in from

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,760
different places we'll talk about

00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,260
authentication later and something works

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,150
at home but it doesn't work at work or

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,710
vice versa this is what you want to

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:46,650
check on their current user some more

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:49,440
general information about the server now

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,850
there's a gut you hear that Chuck would

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,670
probably notice but probably not the

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,590
rest of you mysql can use different

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:59,100
character sets and collations which

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:02,580
means you can have the deals & M lots

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,720
and if you need them if you don't you

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,970
can just stick to the Latin one

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:11,820
character set now most people can if

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,180
they need whom lots orsa deals or sir

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,480
complex's they're going to use utf-8 big

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,440
trouble is they do not ute latin1 and

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,790
utf-8 are not equivalent so sometimes if

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,740
you're moving stuff between different

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,390
character sets you'll get goo and

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,720
there's no way to undo the goo once you

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,720
get it

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,240
yeah so so as beginners your goal is to

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,900
figure out how to keep that equal to

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,490
that and by the way is Americans we can

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,339
stick by Latin one because it's in the

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:05,070
Constitution I believe that was a

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:07,110
drummer now show databases will show you

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:12,300
the available databases to the current

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:14,910
user and in this case you can see that

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:19,500
we did a show database with the command

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:24,750
terminated with a semicolon or you can

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,270
terminate it with a /g if you're an

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,310
old-time SQL person and you come over

00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:34,170
from Oracle or db2 you probably want to

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:35,670
do the /g if you're a pearl programmer

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,839
you'll probably want to do the semicolon

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,839
do the same thing

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:54,089
since like 3.21 yeah and we even have

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:58,589
any other one we can show you by the way

00:15:54,089 --> 00:16:00,839
to get out of the client / q and there's

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,160
also a lovely / h 2 that will give you

00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:07,889
help that will scroll off the screen

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:10,250
until you learn how to uh yes sir oh you

00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:12,839
actually want me in the in the video oh

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,829
that's horrible that's going to torture

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,829
the folks who didn't actually come

00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:22,680
loading data we have some example

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,079
databases you can get from for mysql and

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,459
if you've gone through our doc sets or

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,930
you've gone through our training classes

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,259
or you've gone through a certification

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:35,279
program you've probably seen them

00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:39,899
they're called world and tequila here's

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,750
an example of we start up mysql look on

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,569
the local box and notice i didn't give

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,880
it a database name mysql comes up and i

00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:50,250
got rid of all the start missing i say

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,449
okay create a database called world with

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:59,519
a ending with a /g could be a semicolon

00:16:53,449 --> 00:17:01,769
and then i say use that database which

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,980
is kind of the CD of into the database

00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:08,220
and then i can tell it source world

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,350
underscore in 0 DB SQL and it will take

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,839
the files from the world database and

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:16,020
put into the system this is a standard

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,600
way of loading in data if you run

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,890
something like moodle or Drupal or

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,120
anything let that this is the way

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,030
they're going to load up tables behind

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,299
the scenes it's not mysterious it's

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:31,919
actually rather unmagical when you start

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:34,290
looking at it in the real world ok so

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,260
you load the data and you're not a DBA

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,190
and you're starting what can you do well

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,169
the first command you're going to want

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,900
to do is show tables this will show you

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,600
that in that world database you have

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,780
three tables city country and country

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,679
language and a very simple sequel

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,169
command is select star which is the wild

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,869
card for everything

00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:59,119
the table city or you can actually

00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:01,879
explicitly if you know the column name

00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,889
select name country code from City and

00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:07,879
you can give it qualifiers like we're

00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:08,960
populations over 10 million and once

00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:12,169
again these slides will be up on

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,119
slideshare net under slideshare net /

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,350
Dave smoke / presentations as soon as I

00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,350
can get some network bandwidth today

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,389
okay so here's a good linux admin and

00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:25,039
you want to learn how to backup the data

00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:27,679
there are lots and lots of ways to

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:33,440
backup the data usually you serialize it

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:36,289
or you do some sort of snapshot the

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,989
folks who are used to lv m snapshots you

00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:40,730
can do that most people tend to

00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:43,249
serialize the data when they start off

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:48,139
and we supply a wonderful client program

00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:50,239
called MySQL dump it's very basic it

00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:52,700
doesn't do a lot of really neat stuff

00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,980
but when you're beginners play with this

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,960
it will work over the network so you can

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,489
backup stuff from another host it's a

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,440
good way to move data sets around if you

00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:03,440
have to and you normally give it a

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,859
command like MySQL dump minus minus all

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,690
databases and give it a file name if you

00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,889
don't give it a file name walk away from

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,179
the terminal for a while because you're

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:15,799
getting a bunch of characters on

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:17,899
standard out for a while and you can

00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,789
actually spell out the man paid the

00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:23,659
manual page for this is like five or six

00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:25,909
pages printed out but as novices please

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,090
backup your data when you start off this

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,970
way there are other programs out there

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:35,200
that will do intermittent interment

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,309
parallel backups intermittent backups

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,259
you can schedule to run at various

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,700
intervals and all that but this is kind

00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:44,529
of like the beginning kind of using VI

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,529
to learn how to texted it on a Linux box

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,139
ok login authentication for those of you

00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,619
who've been playing with Pam for a while

00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:57,350
you're going to find this a little bit

00:19:53,619 --> 00:20:02,179
pedestrian when a connection is made

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:04,460
from a MySQL client to a server it looks

00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:06,520
at what host are you coming in if that

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,210
host is not allowed and approved in

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,880
user table it ignores the connection if

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,070
that host is ok it says ok what user do

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,500
they want to connect as and then it will

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:23,230
check username and password of course to

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,800
make things even more muddier all this

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,910
stuff is kept in a database called MySQL

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,410
so when someone says gee there's

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,510
something wrong with the mysql database

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:35,290
as a DBA you think oh my god that's the

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,430
user privileges database and the users

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:41,710
probably just talking about the database

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:44,560
in general now doing this by hand on the

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,090
command line you can do it there's 19

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,560
privileges you have to either set to a

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:54,310
capital y or a capital m and it's a real

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,720
good typing exercise I have dyslexic

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,840
fingers get halfway through a command

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,680
line and into messing it up thank God we

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,720
have GUI tools like MySQL workbench some

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,400
of you might like PHP man in my item

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,980
internet workbench is really nice

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,020
because it lets you point and click and

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,430
it has preset privileged groups that you

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,080
can just click for somebody the other

00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,900
big hint is when you're starting out be

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,640
stingy with permissions if you've ever

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,980
again root privileged to someone in your

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,450
company that didn't need it but you gave

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,670
it to them anyway and it been burned by

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:32,920
it you can see why this is and the best

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:36,120
thing after you learn how to shut it up

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,380
shut start up my skill and bring it down

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,010
start reading through chapter 6 of the

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,100
MySQL manual this is where a lot of dbas

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,420
get burned it's not that long but

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,520
there's a couple gotchas in there you

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:57,240
need to know about that I can't go into

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:57,240
in a simple one hour session uh-huh

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:18,260
okay again yeah yes yes yes sir very

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,920
sick Christian the the question was does

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,270
host look up affect connections and one

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,910
of the things you'll find out very

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,800
rapidly is that if your DNS goes bad

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:31,700
people will call you up and blame the

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,160
database what's happening is the the

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,600
mysql server is going out and saying

00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,030
okay this guy's coming in from this

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,670
address it's not on my table but is it a

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,110
hostname that I don't have cached and

00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,580
that's when you get the vicious cycle of

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,290
the DNS is down there for its the

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,550
database this problem even though it's

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,550
the database is fine

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,090
yeah I'm very surprised that no one in

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,740
the user community in the linux world

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,350
has not decided everyone should pay a

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,559
dollar to peek Makka petrus and crew for

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,659
DNS if you've never gone into that code

00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:21,029
or you've never heard Pete Myka petrus

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:24,210
speak about DNS it's worth the time user

00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:26,730
table grows was just about every sub

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,409
release that we have the fields that

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,460
you're going to concentrate on or the

00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:35,850
hostname the username and password now

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,260
you can set up accounts where you're Joe

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,149
coming in from home and you have

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,279
different privileges than you do Joe

00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:44,460
from the office or Joe from your mobile

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,110
device one of the things will happen is

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,179
you'll have someone complain to you that

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,830
gee this is working great this weekend

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,409
at home I come into work and it's not

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,720
right what you'll end up having to do is

00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,190
sort the host table and find out if they

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,210
have multiple logins or how they're

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,860
coming in back when I showed you the

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,809
backslash s where it shows you the

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,730
current user that's what you're going to

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:09,299
look at you're going to compare the

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,850
username and the host and if you're

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,260
walking into an established mysql system

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,049
that's been around running since the

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,850
persian 31 or version 4 do not be

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:20,809
surprised if you have multiple entries

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,809
from the same person

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,240
so how many folks do all their admin

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:38,340
through the command line on their linux

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,020
boxes here okay that's the way I learned

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,660
on UNIX that's the way I've done it on

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,700
my lunch boxes ever since when you're

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:49,410
trying to remember the various 19

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:52,410
privileges for MySQL trying to remember

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:56,030
the sequel syntax and putting all these

00:24:52,410 --> 00:25:00,060
things with the yes or no it's painful

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:02,790
use workbench it's free it has a whole

00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,370
bunch of other and from bits to it like

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,890
a query tool it also has an

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,480
entity-relationship mapper so if you get

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,920
someone else's databases and you don't

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,080
know where the various tables reference

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,120
each other you do that and get a nice

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,370
printout of what the tables look like

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,080
but the most valuable thing for a novice

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:24,240
DBA is it will let you create accounts

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,590
check out their privileges turn things

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,000
on and off on a GUI and if you're doing

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,410
it by the command line what will bite

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,180
you every time is you'll forget the

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,790
command at the very end called flush

00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,320
privileges if you change something in

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:41,160
the tape here's a man laughing he's been

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,930
bit by it yeah you make all these lovely

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,180
changes and you don't tell the server

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:48,030
that the privileges of change go back a

00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,470
reroute the privilege table and it's

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,520
like if you don't do that the server

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:57,000
doesn't know the changes have been made

00:25:50,520 --> 00:26:00,510
and you were just confused so rather

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,610
than retype all these it's easier to use

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,690
the command line now this is

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:09,690
unfortunately hard to see but we use a

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,160
backslash capital G remember earlier I

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,470
talked about the semicolon and the

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,720
lowercase G if you don't want things

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,480
going out on a horizontal format you can

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,250
use the backslash capital G and it will

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,730
output the information in a horizontal

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,730
format

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:39,590
now like I said it's kind of hard to

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:40,820
give you the basics in an hour if you

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,560
really are interested in running mysql

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:49,100
please download the slide deck a little

00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:52,070
bit later but this is kind of a vast

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,580
overview of a huge subject and I can't

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:59,570
go very much in depth on anything here

00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,030
but the trick is I started having no

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:05,890
knowledge and was able to learn it lots

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:08,330
of other folks have it's a very valuable

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,880
skill to have I used to run

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,530
certification for MySQL then about twice

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,140
a week I get calls from folks looking

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:18,710
for certified DBAs MySQL dbas are in

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,970
high demand so if I haven't scared you

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,680
away please think about training on

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,960
MySQL now you can do it through a

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,880
training class I highly recommend the

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,900
MySQL classes there's some other vendors

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,200
out the hallway that will have some

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,390
training classes a lot of areas have

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,540
good local users groups that run

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:43,010
training your local whoracle users group

00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:46,640
might have some two webinars MySQL runs

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:49,460
about eight webinars a month and they're

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,340
all free and we have a bunch that are on

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,440
demand so you can go back listen to

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,370
those the lady in the room next door

00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,340
runs a podcast every week and she covers

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:06,320
in a little 10-15 minute segment various

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,850
subjects we also have conferences the

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,100
next big conference is going to be right

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:15,500
before Oracle OpenWorld it's called

00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:18,950
MySQL connect we got just had an

00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,300
innovation day on Tuesday and the

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,780
webcast on that should be ready for a

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,880
replay there are shows like this one

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,890
self paz con I don't know if intended

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:33,440
poss contr in the year where we do do

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:35,960
sessions i recommend scanning planet

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,240
Maskull com this is a blog aggregation

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,250
site that goes over who's doing what and

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,900
there's also forums out there right now

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,710
we're getting spammed by some folks in

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,270
Vietnam there

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:51,440
trying to sell us some of their free on

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,419
refrigeration systems but some of the

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,220
forms are someone hitting a couple the

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,230
forms but this is a good place where if

00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:04,010
you have a question put it out there on

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:05,809
the relevant form another place to go if

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,890
you're a novice is I really recommend

00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:13,850
this book the author is in the room next

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:18,440
door this really is a Bible it should be

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:22,159
on your your book stand once you get

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,570
down the road a little bit further you

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:29,690
should get this book one of the authors

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:32,120
is sitting in the back this really

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,399
doesn't cover the beginning basics but

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,090
once you get limping along this will

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,730
give you a lot of great material on how

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:43,760
to speed things up how to organize how

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,320
to get into replication and don't buy

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,580
the first or second edition the new

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,419
third edition has been out for about a

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:55,370
month now another speaker here this week

00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:57,740
Ronald Bradford has a series the first

00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,130
books out there little they're short

00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:05,299
they're like 150 pages and they're very

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:08,210
concise and he's the one on backup is

00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:13,029
just coming out and the optimizations

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:15,320
been out for six or seven months if

00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:16,610
you're interested in certification this

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,200
is still the manual for certification

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:24,890
even though it's mysql 50 on the cover

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,620
and we're currently 55 is generally

00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,970
available this is also a good general

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,350
reference book it's beginning to get a

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,580
little bit dated but i doubt there'll be

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,659
a major update any time soon so if

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:42,200
you're going to use bookstore you see a

00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:43,460
copy of this grab it and I did a lot

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,630
faster than I thought it would but I

00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:51,190
wanted to have time for general

00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:51,190
questions see if anyone stuck anyplace

00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:04,440
let me go back to the griffith go back

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:10,860
to the very beginning slideshare net /

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,270
Dave Stokes last presentations or if you

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:25,110
want grab one of my business cards then

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:27,030
I can email it to you yeah so you folks

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,430
have been play with MySQL mode you

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:35,280
recommend more for beginners what would

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:37,920
you recommend for beginners you've done

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,210
my you set up my SQL servers before what

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:44,250
else would you recommend that for the

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:46,950
novices in the room the number one thing

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:51,720
that I see is assisted man is that it's

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:55,200
good to have a separate user for each

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,510
website that you're hosting so you know

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,020
it's very common to have a my SQL

00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:03,630
backend for various websites if you're

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,080
hosting several of them all on a single

00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,300
server the idea is create a separate

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,520
database for each and then create a

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,260
separate user for each and then what you

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,630
do is grant you know if you're running

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,800
something out WordPress you can create a

00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:22,800
user WP 1 and then grant WP 1 full

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,090
access to just that one database and

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,030
then the good thing about that is that

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:30,720
if someone figures out how to get in and

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:33,870
look at that one set of data they can't

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,130
see all the other data okay cool so I

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:39,450
think that's probably the main thing

00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:43,110
that I noticed in running mysql assisted

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:46,790
min cool don't we make sure you get a

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,790
dolphin recall

00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:59,090
since you're mentioning you know user

00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:01,550
tips PHP my admin has saved my butt more

00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,650
times than I can even tell you just

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,330
because of the ease of the interface as

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,120
opposed to doing everything command line

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,070
I think having that GUI tool to be an

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,050
administrator has got to be the number

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,030
one thing you know because if you've got

00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,760
to research all of those things every

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,350
single time you need to do something

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,980
it's going to take you you know hours

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:24,980
and hours so that that would be my

00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,480
advice yeah well I got a bit i'm a

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,990
dinosaur i learned on the command line

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,490
and i just gave up on it this year so

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:34,730
and i've been using mysql since three

00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:42,230
two one came out you can do it that way

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:44,980
but why to and you know once i switched

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,450
over to GUI i never went back okay and

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,650
yes for those of you without gray hair

00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,120
it was kind of hard doing all this

00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:54,470
computer stuff for the dinosaurs roaming

00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,000
around okay do we have any novices with

00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:03,020
some questions you're totally Fabregas

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,120
do you want when you're setting up it

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,090
looked like you probably covered enough

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,690
of this information with the for example

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:16,429
if you have a linux server that has no

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:19,129
GUI on it and i'm not i'm used to the

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:23,270
gooey stuff like PHP myadmin i've used

00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:26,540
that for for the my sequel setups it

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,750
looks how what would be the example of

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:33,440
the how to set up exactly to be able to

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:37,010
get to it from another machine to be

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,350
able to fire up the a gui-based sequel

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,230
management my sequel manageable xterm

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,580
into this next term onto the box do the

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,399
installation do all this lovely stuff

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,350
and then you use PHP my admin or

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,540
workbench or one of the other tools and

00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,629
you just tell it we're working on this

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,100
host and if you have the permissions the

00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:57,080
privileges the network and everything

00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,230
else set up it's like working on a local

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,770
host right okay but just just setting up

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,420
the

00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:06,800
the server to allow the remote host is

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,310
that was assumed that was part of what

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,610
was covered in the the authentications

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:16,220
part yeah a lot of that post yeah but

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,710
usually if you like on a ubuntu box you

00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,870
do the apt-get install mysql server and

00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:24,080
all the required tools it's going to

00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:26,510
open up port 3306 for you and you can

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:30,440
login across the network to get to the

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:32,570
box okay the reason I'm asking is I've

00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,430
tried that before but it says you know

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,870
something like this is restricted to

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:45,020
host 127 001 and it will not allow me to

00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:46,820
do that remotely yeah yeah yeah you're

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,760
going to have now you're going to have

00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:53,230
to get on the box xterm you're going to

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,360
have to mysql minus user root mysql

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,980
database and modify the user table and

00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,790
usually what most people do is they find

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,130
the entry for root and they change the

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,770
the IP address slot for the host tool a

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,420
wild card right it's not the most secure

00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:12,830
thing in the world and it will bite you

00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:14,900
on the butt but for general setup you

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,900
can get away with it yeah that might be

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:23,000
something like just do this until I get

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:24,590
a I get to it yeah thanks just something

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
else you can do tues if you learn how to

00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:30,830
use X Windows you can you can host your

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,650
ex windows back to another box where you

00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,950
have graphics you know I have graphics

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:39,350
ability and that works too and that's

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:44,480
that's something that if your your admit

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:46,340
doing administering of headless machines

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,020
like that that that's a really good way

00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,780
to do it I've had to do that a lot of

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,700
times and that's a that's more of a

00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:57,040
general skill to learn it uses use

00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,040
remote x windows and that helps a lot

00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:08,540
thank you very much yeah i just noticed

00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:10,520
that the ssl option is available yeah i

00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,890
guess i got a couple of questions one is

00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,910
how do you implement it and two is do

00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:20,300
you need a separate port for it no you

00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,860
don't need a sec report for it I've only

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,530
set it up once that was years ago it's

00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,530
very well documented in the manual oh ok

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,000
so just look up a cookbook and yeah it

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:35,090
is B if you go to the manual pages on

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,460
implementing ssl it's out there it's one

00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,690
of those things where I did once and not

00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,160
something I pull off the top of my head

00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,780
right here especially with all the

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,850
certificates and pointing to the files

00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:47,120
and all that but there are lots of folks

00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:49,630
who run ssl do you know will support ssl

00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:54,320
and unencrypted both at the same time or

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:56,450
can you require ssl you i believe you

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,860
can require ssl so they have to come in

00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,570
with the certificate in design and all

00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:05,170
that yeah i'm ninety-nine point nine

00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:05,170
nine percent sure but yeah okay thanks

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,710
one of the earth's we've had some coffee

00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,710
this morning toilets

00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:24,299
well if you have any questions later let

00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:27,089
me go all the way to the look we got

00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:30,089
about 14 minutes left and I want to hear

00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:35,189
about any nightmare stories in your DBA

00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:37,679
world yeah oh by the way I like to

00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:39,239
introduce one of the other community

00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,599
managers we have this is keith larsen on

00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:44,759
the back the gentleman in the blue shirt

00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,289
over there is Chuck bell who be talking

00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:48,149
about some of the new utilities we have

00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,249
including the one where you can set it

00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:51,599
up so that your if your master goes out

00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:54,509
and automatically fails over to one of

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,130
your slave servers and probably a little

00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:58,729
bit on global transaction IDs in there

00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,729
and all that fun stuff

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,370
okay yeah if you have questions on

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,350
sessions you don't see this year but you

00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,390
want to have next year please see Keith

00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,800
or myself because we're going to keep

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:24,740
coming back until you folks get this

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,000
right and we want to make sure that

00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,360
we're giving you the information that

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,920
you need and you want yes sir he wanted

00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:36,680
a horror story so I'll give you a horror

00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:39,860
story I maintained a couple of Moodle

00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:43,160
servers for our division website at the

00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:45,440
University and we are completely

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,600
separate from our IT department so we

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,790
don't get any help from them unless we

00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:55,340
really screw up okay we prefer that way

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:57,850
so anyway give phone call one morning

00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:00,200
from the associate academic dean

00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:03,920
wondering why we're running a porn site

00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,080
on our server well too liberal arts

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,250
college isn't it I'm sorry too liberal

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:13,730
arts college right yeah and I don't know

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:17,030
come to find out due to a security hole

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:19,660
in Moodle someone was injecting SQL into

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:25,160
our databases that was causing them to

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:27,710
basically have links to porn websites

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,720
somewhere else in Europe and they were

00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,570
coming through us and of course it was

00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,340
masked through us because of that so we

00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,550
had to go and find where the security

00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,010
hole was in the SQL and take it out so

00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,450
there is a good horror story when you

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,790
get that phone call from the academic

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:47,050
dean wondering what the hell are you

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,050
guys doing down in the math department

00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,640
vector geometry always blame it on

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,640
vector geometry another Moodle horror

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,250
story actually summer moved to Moodle

00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,830
qawali is another system that university

00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,630
to develop an open source and at USC

00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:05,390
which is one of the Paragons of the

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:08,510
quality movement one of our SES was

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,360
there last week and down at the database

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,500
is running slow well he got on there and

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,450
showed him wasn't the database is

00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,400
running slow was there tomcat server was

00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,320
misconfigured so what they're doing

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,910
every time the database ran slow was

00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,990
stopped the database restarts the

00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,930
database

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:26,180
during that time the tomcat server reset

00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:29,350
and work great so now they just realize

00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,350
that they don't have a database problem

00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,450
okay I'm sorry I ran out of dolphins do

00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,270
you have any more dolphins at the table

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:41,140
Keith so you have to bug somebody in

00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:43,310
this room to make sure you get a dolphin

00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,619
well thank you all for coming out if you

00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:48,100
have any mysql questions get any of us

00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,690
with the little dolphin things or keith

00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,520
we have two tracks and like i said we're

00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,630
going to be enacted back next year so

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,050
you have suggestions about stuff you

00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:59,240
want to see let us know if you have

00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,160
general questions I'm David Stokes at

00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:07,360
Oracle oops supposed to be back from the

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:10,220
screen please contact us let us know and

00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,410
please please please become DBAs if you

00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,180
go to your local mysql user group

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,400
meeting you'll find that a third of the

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,560
people there are looking to hire dbas

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,970
peter how many DBAs would you like to

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,860
hire this week five so that's the front

00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,100
row the other couple rows you're going

00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,840
to go out and look someplace else so

00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,859
wait so next week okay well thank you

00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,859
all very much for coming up

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,520
you

00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,789
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,740
ago we could not have imagined that

00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:16,930
asterisk would not only become the most

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,089
widely adopted open source communication

00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,130
software on the planet but that it would

00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:23,650
impact the entire industry in the way

00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,630
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,240
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,220
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,319
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,700
transition of power from the hands of

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,980
the traditional proprietary phone

00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,380
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,299
administrators of phone systems using

00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,529
this power our customers have created

00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:43,480
all sorts of business changing

00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:45,339
applications from small office phone

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,500
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:49,450
the international carrier networks in

00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,250
fact there's even an entire country

00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,829
those communications infrastructure runs

00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,750
on esters the gym has always been about

00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:57,460
creating technology that expands

00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,650
communications capabilities in ways that

00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,849
we could never have imagined and that's

00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,220
part of what's game-changing about

00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:05,920
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:08,019
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,150
IP phones that extends control of the

00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:11,890
user all the way to the desktop the

00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,599
launch of these new products represents

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,579
the next phase in Digium history of

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,099
innovation these are the first and only

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:19,809
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,369
power of esters when we first discussed

00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:23,410
our expectations for building a family

00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,569
of phones for use with asterisks our

00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,279
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,930
the team to build the phones such that

00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:31,119
they were easy to install integrate

00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,980
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,529
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,180
that goal user feedback is validating

00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:39,279
that when it comes to operation with

00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,710
asher space systems including our own

00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:44,289
Switchvox based product these are the

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,579
easiest to use best integrated most

00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:48,190
interoperable products on the market

00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:50,170
today the Digium family of phones will

00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,269
initially include three IP desk phones

00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,160
uniquely designed to complement any

00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:56,049
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,690
these phones are different for a number

00:44:56,049 --> 00:45:01,359
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,799
designed for use with asterisks secondly

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,410
we've made it really easy to

00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:06,789
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,470
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:10,420
to access information inside of

00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,420
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,410
between an application and the phone

00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,569
additionally we've created an

00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,670
applications engineer that allows users

00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:21,910
and developers to create and run their

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,680
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:25,630
done all of this at a very compelling

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,309
price point at Digium we're always

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,410
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:31,990
the best value in business phone systems

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,549
and also give them the power to create

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,680
their own solutions or any

00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:37,420
communications challenge well continue

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,829
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,900
astros cooler faster and more

00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:42,520
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,980
asterisk and what communications even

00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:48,420
easier and together we'll change the way

00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,420
the world communication again

00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:06,579
prospects I every way this is the way to

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:08,500
better utilize all your resources and it

00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:11,559
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:16,420
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:19,780
in open source the collaborative nature

00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,450
and of the you know of the community and

00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,339
the speed at which these are these you

00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,440
know these these deficiencies these bugs

00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:29,049
are getting discovered and then fixed is

00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,410
it like that really shows the power of

00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:34,030
the of the open source community it is

00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:38,230
global and it's definitely because of

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:44,559
the users community people are extremely

00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:46,450
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,760
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,490
guys helping each other out and they're

00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,170
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:56,190
the product is transparent for everyone

00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:59,109
everyone can look at the code base

00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,849
everyone can see how close darkest is

00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:06,700
being built nothing nothing is

00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:09,369
proprietary everything is open in many

00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,569
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:17,319
unborn health CloudStack the most

00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:21,190
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:23,859
was our first developer boot camp

00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:26,530
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:30,490
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:34,660
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:37,480
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,030
chairs in the room twice everything

00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:43,359
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:46,329
is open source and so I don't think that

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,099
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:51,130
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:53,829
computing and so i think it's i think

00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:55,210
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,319
about cloud computing you're really

00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:01,869
talking about open source cloud

00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:05,020
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:07,420
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:11,290
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:13,990
each data centers these hardware is

00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:17,470
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:20,170
to handle number one that mass scale

00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:23,349
number two it's designed to handle the

00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:26,230
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:30,400
deployments started working on contact

00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:33,670
over four years ago and it was the

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,470
original set of people working on it had

00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:39,550
a background of delivering software

00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:43,810
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:47,410
lots of users actually using it high

00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:50,500
availability is the key feature multiple

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,510
hypervisors support different network

00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,180
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,460
you better while step management server

00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:01,150
can be deployed in different physical

00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,800
machines it definitely has a huge

00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:07,780
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,359
there's a major movie studio that they

00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,569
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:15,640
to transcode video and I thought that

00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:17,290
was terribly fascinating what I found

00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:20,560
more fascinating is what they did during

00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:23,349
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,490
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:26,350
lunch was over they would this

00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:30,490
all the instances and go back to doing

00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:32,110
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:34,180
so many different aspects and there's no

00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:36,550
one person that's kind of like a master

00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,660
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:42,880
as a project is going to be one of the

00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:46,960
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:52,390
most feature fallen and and robust

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:55,290
platforms out they were Adam senior
