the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,750
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,910
possible yeah we've had a great time

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,740
when to the Billy Graham library went up

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,590
to the epicenter done a whole lot of

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,989
other cool things went implantations so

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
we're having a great time I have heard

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,280
great things about this conference and I

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,309
was excited to be invited this year and

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,340
unable to attend so thank you it's great

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,250
to have you all here this talk is called

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,780
practical computerized home automation

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,550
yes i am a post go squirt team member

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,280
that's what most people know me as but

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,270
also being a computer guy i'm a tinker

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:05,339
and sort of over the years have

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,640
developed a little sort of hobby of sort

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,369
of automating some stuff in the house

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,680
i'm going to kind of give you some some

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,280
little tricks in in terms of how i did

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,930
it the trick not as all that you know

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,900
it's kind of funny the trick with home

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,680
automation is not always technical it's

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,950
often the trick is often convincing your

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,020
family that you're doing a good thing

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,700
okay that you're not crazy that the you

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,670
know sort of boxes that keep coming

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,549
every couple weeks are not sort of this

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,740
sort of you know what your family is

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,689
grinning and bearing and also I'm not

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,159
spooking your family out which is a big

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,500
sort of trick for home automation

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:55,020
because the few cases where your work is

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,090
directly interfacing with your family

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,520
because again I don't think my family

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,170
really understands what I do on a

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,930
day-to-day basis a much or how many of

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,219
you it sort of like at all these stairs

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,860
of the screen and does things and then

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,259
checks come right is about you know is

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,480
about the level and they watch me and

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,740
may hear me talks and you know they pick

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,450
up

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,070
funny terms that i use and stuff but in

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,980
general it's not something they're

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,390
involved with on a day-to-day basis

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,600
however with home animation they can all

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,220
i really like it or not so there are a

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,890
couple spooky things about how morning

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,880
shall talk about and i think overall

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,270
you're going to find there's a lot of

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,460
really good things about it so again

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,960
usually i give this talk of my son whose

00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,580
name actually appears in the slide in

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,800
this case my wife will be sort of

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,310
pinch-hitting for him to give her

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,540
feedback on little things that she sees

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,010
the goal of this talk for me is to

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,610
basically inspire you into into doing

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,580
some home automation on your own and

00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:00,130
frankly trying to give you not so much

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:03,080
the operational or technical

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,840
understanding of home automation but

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,300
more of the procedural and the process

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,100
and identifying when home automation

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,080
makes sense for your home and went home

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,390
automation does not make sense for your

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,430
home and i think that I've sort of

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,430
gleaned over years of experimenting with

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,950
my own family and also being kind of

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,880
cautious about how i went at it so i'll

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,520
give you some tricks to the trade and so

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,440
before we start there any questions we

00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,200
do have an hour which i'm excited about

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,060
I do have a second presentation which I

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,100
might pull slides from depending on

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,650
whether we have time this presentation

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,110
along with 30 other presentations not

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,960
all our automation thankfully are at

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:48,440
that website that is my home page it has

00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,360
you know my blog and a lot of post Chris

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,760
presentations fortunately or

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,440
unfortunately and again this is Creative

00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:02,380
Commons license if anybody wants to use

00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:02,380
it okay yes sir yes sir

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,159
okay so the question is he he he played

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,170
with home automation in the past started

00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,289
using compact fluorescents and was

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,359
getting problems with some of the

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:23,240
settings I will cover that in this

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,610
session and if I have some diagrams that

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,850
kind of explain it a little bit and

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,430
there are some some adjustments you can

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,889
make which will vastly improve the

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:41,630
problem okay other questions okay let's

00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:44,720
get started okay so what what what

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,880
basically is available for home

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,910
automation and basically I'm going to

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,250
start by kind of talking about some of

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:57,949
the pre what I would consider

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,750
non-program 'ok automation so many of

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,120
you may have automation already in your

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,800
homes and not really realize it again

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,070
the topic of this conversation is

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,259
practical computerized home automation

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,849
okay so let's start with home automation

00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:15,229
it isn't computerized or at least

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:16,610
doesn't relate to a typical server so

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:19,639
first one time are so many people

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,870
primers in their homes right okay you

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,750
have to reset those every time you lose

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,400
power yeah every time at times n change

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,010
I mean the daylight savings time if

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,810
change it but yeah they work really well

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:33,400
I don't think anybody has a clapper I'd

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,169
be surprised you know clap on clap off

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,370
but it is automation right it's kind of

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:42,760
cool you know excite your friends

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,500
obviously that's a sound control system

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,419
the stored sensors i bet half the room

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,380
has some of that in some yeah in some

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:52,639
sense but usually it's it's it's

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,210
integrated with something right so it's

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,039
a sensor integrated with a light or some

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,560
type of light socket which has a center

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,570
tutor you've added a sensor to a light

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,970
you bring electrician in and he kind of

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,449
sets it up I know we had wanted old

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,270
house and it broke ones and then he had

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,009
to come and redo it but it actually

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,990
worked out well right you come out it

00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:18,220
would see you moving sometimes you do

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,350
this to it to get it to go but

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,780
again that's sort of a non programming

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,850
automation case and of course motion

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,560
sensor is the same kind of thing of you

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,350
know move your hand or walk by and it

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,790
goes on one of the problems you see with

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,490
some of these is you start to see the

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,240
limitations of the technology you know

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,490
motion sensor it never hope that doesn't

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,050
always work right it just it just always

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,760
seemed to be kind of something that

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,200
never went on exactly when you thought

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,070
it would and then it would go on if you

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,260
walk by or something crazy like that but

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,170
again these are these are non

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,000
programmatic so let's take a look at

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,610
programmatic automation this is really I

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,310
think where the excitement comes this is

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,960
where your your your skills start to

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,790
work and where you really start to get

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,360
what I want to say a multiplicative

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,530
effect with automation and again I think

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,060
that's one of the things I'm going to be

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,250
talking about sort of through the

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:19,120
through the session in non programmatic

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,850
automation each device is an island so

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,300
you have a motion sensor it's wired to a

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:28,030
bulb okay you have a timer it's wired to

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,650
a lamp or something like that okay you

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,360
even have a doling does a sensor but

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,180
again it's wired to a specific thing

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,000
what happens with programmatic

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,479
automation is that all of a sudden you

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,100
you open a whole new you now can have

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,850
your devices communicating with each

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,190
other and as soon as that happens your

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,740
your automation you take on a lot more

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,080
possibilities than you normally would in

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,640
a case where each one's an island I

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,250
almost think of it as the internet right

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,680
you know if you have a computer and it's

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,150
just the computer sitting there you know

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,310
if it doesn't have internet there's not

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,290
a whole lot you can do with it right you

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,200
can go to word processor and do some

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,370
stuff but but again a lot of devices are

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,390
really hampered but because they don't

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,590
have the internet we have the internet

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,120
all of a sudden you can go get videos

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,919
you can send email there's a whole bunch

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,540
of there's a multiplicative effect when

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,550
you're on the internet that you can do

00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,380
that you don't have when you're in a

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,940
standalone device and I think that's

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:27,820
really to me the the sort of this is

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,900
where home automation takes off and the

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,750
downside fact is I have not seen

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,719
many people kind of take this leap

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,430
they've got timers they've got dawn dusk

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,479
sensors day but but they don't really

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,839
always have the kind of multiplicative

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,070
effect that you get with a

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,570
computer-controlled automation system

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,180
where all these devices are now working

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:54,470
together and now you're sitting at a

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,029
terminal or a cron job or some type of

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,800
script that's running every time

00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,150
something happens and all of a sudden

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,710
you can make all these crazy things

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,410
happen that didn't necessarily happen

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,060
before all right so let me let me be an

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,500
under that's really where up in the sky

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,480
but I'm going to be really specific as I

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,490
go forward so let's take a look at what

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,490
things we have here so program on

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:17,650
automation specifically you can combine

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:20,890
the behavior devices so for example when

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:24,170
when we decide we're going to eat dinner

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:28,100
or lunch whole bunch of things can

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:30,920
happen in the house with one action okay

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,050
or if somebody calls on the phone and

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,580
it's a specific individual based on

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,440
caller ID I can do all these other

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,170
things they get I couldn't necessarily

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,060
do with all these were in Ireland okay

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,250
the second thing is that you know this

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,620
this limitation so again instead of

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,000
having a case where you got your your

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,640
motion sensor over here but there's

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,830
nothing you can't do anything outside

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,050
that motion sensor or whatever's

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,910
specifically wired between that motion

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,760
sensor is something else it's not a it's

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,279
not a fungible issue right it's it's

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,320
basically a hardwired in most cases

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,580
we've helped with computers or

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,560
motivation now there's no distance

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,730
requirements so somebody can do

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,890
something over here you can do something

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,750
over there you don't have the kind of

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,140
sort of rigid limitations that you

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,459
normally would have in a hardwired

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,000
automation non programming adequate

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:21,950
augmentation you can detect activity

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,110
your programs can now be scriptable so

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,050
you can do all sorts of things like I

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,880
want this to happen but only during the

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,880
day I don't want it to happen at night

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,220
or while I'm sleeping again very hard to

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,380
do in them in a hardwired system very

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,420
easy to do when a computer starts to get

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,700
involved and you can also access

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,589
external data so you can go out and get

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,640
the temperature you can go up the gout

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:46,160
and get the cloud

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,440
you can go out and get whether it's a

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,580
vacation day or not for the United

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,290
States I mean there's all sorts of

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,830
things you can do you can send SMS

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:57,290
messages you can you can receive emails

00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,850
in and trigger things you can have

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,200
people go to web pages and do stuff I

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,270
mean a whole bunch of crazy stuff can

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,670
now be done but necessarily couldn't be

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:09,080
done before so how is this possible well

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,880
basically let's take a look at the

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,790
network's you have in your house all

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,110
right you have a telephone network I

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,820
know it doesn't sound like a network but

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,890
it is right you pick up the phone you

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,470
doll something you call somebody else

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,870
it's a network all right you have a

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,910
cordless phone that's probably in some

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,880
sense of wireless network in a very

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,600
crude sense you can call from one phone

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,700
to another it's sort of something there

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,640
you might have while ethernet at least

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,620
it's some portion of your home you

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,900
probably have a wireless internet at the

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,190
same time and then you also have

00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,630
something that you don't really think of

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,870
as a network and that is your electrical

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,700
system why is your electrical system

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,350
important well your life is this is

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,940
important because like if you're going

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,330
to turn something on and off odds are

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,930
it's using electricity so oh I'm not

00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,360
really ready to run you know ethernet to

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,330
everywhere I'm really not ready to put a

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,720
wireless hotspot on every device I want

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,090
to control I probably have some

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,510
electrical cord weird electrical wiring

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:17,060
that runs between the computer and all

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,170
these other things okay I know it

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,300
doesn't sound like something you would

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,860
use often but in fact it works out

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,690
really really well and I'm going to

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,670
explain egg why exactly right now so

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,520
this is the way that the electro system

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,860
normally works in your home basically it

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,740
has a cycle of 60 Hertz at least the

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,180
United States I think in Europe it's 50

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,680
and it's basically just going up and

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,850
down up and down and that's alternating

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,380
current right it's kind of going I'm

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,570
sure there's people here to understand

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,180
this much better than I do so I'm not

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,890
going to pretend but effectively your

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,570
your electro system is doing this all

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:55,820
the time it's doing this in this room

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:57,350
wherever you are okay obviously doing

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,050
this electrical system there

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,850
our periods where the electrical goes to

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,790
the origin which is throw to the center

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,100
line right the center red line here it's

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:11,210
going to be crossing back and forth and

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,850
about 30 or 40 years ago I believe in

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,220
the 70s somebody realized that they

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,770
could send messages along this

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,110
electrical wiring system without

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,150
interfering with the actual transmission

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,850
of power so if you've ever heard of

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,300
power of Ethernet this is a similar kind

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,640
of thing although much cruder than that

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:35,450
so basically what they ended up doing

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,130
was to send signals across this they

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,550
basically create a little blip every

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:44,810
time this cycles over that origin point

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:47,810
okay so if you add up a bunch of these

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:50,750
and again you've got 60 cycles a second

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:54,830
so you've got I think technically 120

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:57,920
crossings okay in a second so you've got

00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:01,370
120 bits to work with tremendously slow

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,940
but that's okay in a lot of cases okay

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,100
you can actually encode commands into

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,720
this stream of data that's getting

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,880
broadcast crew your all your entire

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,170
house that you'll have to wire that you

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,960
don't have to really do a whole lot of

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,910
work with okay so effectively what's

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,160
happening is that every time it kind of

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,710
goes over its encoding some bits a one

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,050
or a zero there's kind of a header that

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,720
you have that indicates here comes a

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:30,890
command that's coming across my network

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,630
and effectively that allow you can put

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,550
devices in different locations that can

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,440
listen for these little blips so you

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,390
have a transmitter which is sending the

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,890
blips and then you've it's going across

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,260
the whole house and then all these

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,210
devices can actually read these blips as

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,790
they come across and then perform

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,130
actions based on on the blips that T's

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,260
come across okay so what does this

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,390
actually look like in real life well

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,100
here's an oscilloscope again I didn't

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,050
write this this is a an image from

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,480
somebody actually it's from it's from

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,460
this website right here at the bottom

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,040
but effectively that's the standard you

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,000
know sine wave coming across and what

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,500
does it look like when you're actually

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,930
sending these signals well it actually

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,970
looks like these sort of trapezoids I

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,600
guess we will call them which are

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,569
effective

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:21,399
making signals as the such as the data

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:21,399
comes across ok so I'm sorry yes ma'am

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,579
mean like a circuit breaker okay so the

00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,709
question is is there any impact of

00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,810
different circuit breakers in your

00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,089
system are they different networks I am

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,399
actually going to cover that that that

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,199
is actually a concern and there are some

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,050
ways as I said to this gentleman that

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,720
you have to kind of protect against that

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,339
okay and again i'm not i'm not saying

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,139
this is the be-all and end-all way to do

00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,029
it okay i'm just kind of giving the

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,649
ground worker way somebody did it and

00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,449
you can think of other ways to do it

00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,310
because of course this is just one

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:04,160
method we could do it wirelessly you

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,170
could do it via 802 11 I mean whatever

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,449
you know whatever method you want to use

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,949
to communicate to these devices there

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:11,690
are actually a bunch of them and I'm

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,889
going to cover them just really briefly

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,800
at the end here but I'm just giving you

00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:19,130
one example so effectively okay 1975

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,819
you've got this idea again 120 cycles

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:26,029
across 120 bits per second and then you

00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:28,250
can basically assign numbers or divide

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,370
you know asad device codes to these

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:34,009
things and you basically set up this

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,630
kind of protocol which happens to be

00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,939
called x10 but again there are a lot of

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:41,449
other ones some the other popular ones

00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:44,240
are z-wave universal power boss anybody

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:50,810
heard of that insteon is sort of a

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,730
hybrid between x10 and wireless any

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,959
others somebody anybody's familiar with

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:59,240
those are probably the big ones yeah

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,860
there's commercial protocols that yeah

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,220
they're dated by those are yeah those

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,370
are really high-end stuff yeah but again

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:12,620
it's kind of interesting again it's one

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:14,329
of the tricks with this is well this is

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,400
kind of going on topic but it kind of

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,980
relates one of the tricks with this is

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,470
if you come if you basically start and

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,720
you say ok I got to put out fifteen

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,089
hundred dollars to get started with whom

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,299
on a

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,830
in my home okay that's and I'm going to

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:32,370
do a lot of wiring to make it happen

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:35,250
right there's a lot of people are just

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,020
going to be like I can't do that like I

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,450
can't I don't really know what the

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,580
benefits going to be to my family so

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,750
therefore i'm not really sure that I

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,029
want to put out that money and then

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,409
decide that I don't want it right so

00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:48,360
we'll ought of the trick with because

00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,770
very few people have home automation at

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,200
this level and they haven't actually

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,440
seen the benefits it's really hard to

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,850
sort of get that initial expense and

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,580
that's why a lot of times you're looking

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,350
at doing something over the power line

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,809
or something very inexpensively to get

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,700
started because although you may end up

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,610
spending fifteen hundred dollars by the

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,870
time the whole thing's done okay you

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,940
don't really want to put it out not

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,190
knowing you know sort of you know being

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,529
a pioneer not really understanding what

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,480
you're going to get out of this and

00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,250
that's why I think the x10 makes real

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,529
easy or Insteon makes it really easy to

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,190
kind of get started with a couple

00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:27,029
inexpensive devices and then you

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,039
basically grow it over time and again

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,840
because you're not physically changing

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,730
the wiring your house you can always

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,169
undo it you're not bringing an

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,260
electrician every time to have it done

00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:40,679
which really you know the price just

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,720
goes berserk at that point right so

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,380
again this is just kind of a kind of an

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,100
example affect the way i got involved

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,020
with it was a kind of an odd case i had

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,890
somebody hide electrician and working in

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,200
my house and my wife wanted a switch on

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,510
one floor to control a light on another

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,950
floor so you know the like she wanted

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,320
wall switch in one place to control a

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,399
light somewhere else and we looked at

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,320
the wall you know I looked at sort of

00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,640
the wall configuration and I'm like this

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,529
is gonna be really hard so I asked

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,149
Latricia in or can you do this he's like

00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:14,549
this is gonna be really hard so I'm like

00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:16,440
okay great this is not going to work too

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,260
well any psych heavy have you looked at

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,899
some type of like you know sort of X 10

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,899
or whatever system that would allow the

00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:27,360
communication between a switch

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,799
wirelessly and switch downstairs and

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,679
would actually allow you to concern it

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,169
off and I'm like you know I really

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,450
hadn't I heard of this x10 thing but I

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:36,730
never I never really got involved with

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,960
it

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,660
didn't really know what worked he said

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,809
here does he said I've often when i'm

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,419
wiring a house will offer the customer

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:49,090
do you want some sort of home automation

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,100
like a control panel or something that

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,190
you can basically program to do all this

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,630
stuff I said you know they're like well

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,460
I don't know and he said all right let

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,580
me speck it out i'll give you two quotes

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,110
right and the quote to do the automation

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,929
is usually about seven hundred dollars

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,809
more than the non automation which is

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:10,600
completely reasonable but he says nobody

00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:12,190
ever takes the automation you know

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,559
there's something saying there because

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,120
what it's basically saying is that the

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,460
it's very hard to sell somebody they

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,040
don't it's very hard to sell something

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,540
to somebody who has never seen it or

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,660
they don't know that the benefits that

00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,950
they can get you know if sort of you if

00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,340
you try i remember when i was on the

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,470
internet nobody else was I was like yeah

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,030
you know I'm on the internet and we're

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,160
sending email and they're like you do

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,660
what like yeah you send an email and it

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,510
goes out under usenet and then you get

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,490
replies back and like nobody really knew

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,650
what that was and only really when it

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,030
became sort of ubiquitous there was like

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,860
okay now i understand i want to be on

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,210
the internet but again in the early

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,330
years if I said hey I can get you on the

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,130
Internet to they'd be like no that's

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,580
okay i'm too busy that's not really yeah

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,860
i know it sounds really crazy now but at

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,910
the time you remember it was like we

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,860
were on the internet we had our own

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,620
domain name and we're getting email by

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,900
UCP and all these things and and and

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:12,520
everyone was kind of like okay it's

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:15,010
really interesting you know yeah so so

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:19,840
again a lot of it is is really kind of

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:22,660
getting that first sort of impetus from

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,730
people and getting a thing going so this

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,350
is actually the x10 protocol again this

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,830
is not the be all end all but while just

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,120
one way of doing home automation

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,059
basically you had a housecoat on the

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,500
left which is made up of bit patterns

00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,980
and then you have devices on the right

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,140
12 16 as you can see right right there

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,400
it stops the 16 and then you have a

00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,080
whole bunch of other things allow you to

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,770
dim lights and do all sorts other crazy

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,470
things so um what are the limitations

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,240
well this kind of gets

00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,980
sort of the problem well the first

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,929
problem is again we only have 120 bits

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,150
per second so we're not going to be able

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,799
to flash the lights on 20 times a second

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,830
right that's not going to happen uh-huh

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:05,010
in fact the bandwidth is is fairly

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,039
limited you're probably going to see

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,860
about seven three quarters of a second

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,840
delay to turn something on and again

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,780
that's part of the fact that they will

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,130
send the command twice to verify that it

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,770
actually is the right command because

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,240
again line noise and things like compact

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,640
fluorescents can cause all sorts of

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,320
unusual noise in the system so a device

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,210
has to normally see the thing something

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,740
twice before we will actually act on it

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,090
poor propagation in split phase

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,460
electricity distributions and

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,650
unfortunately most houses are split

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,230
phase this gets back to the thing with

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,429
the with the panel different circuit

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,070
breakers and I'm going to go into that

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:46,169
in detail line noise like things like

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,260
complex Russians can affect you and even

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:51,299
other buildings sending x10 can affect

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,059
you fortunately allah minna you know I'm

00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:55,590
fairly sparse neighborhood so I've never

00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,140
seen that problem but yeah I can see it

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,539
being very very a big problem so this is

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,710
actually the split phase issue and again

00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:04,230
I'm sure that people understand this

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,110
better than I had I do what effectively

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,620
you have 220 coming into your house that

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,830
220 split into one ten at the break up

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,320
downstairs in the basement in my case

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,150
and you basically have your houses on 11

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,120
10 and half your houses on another 110

00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:25,250
that's normally just the way that it's

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,020
wired so effectively if you have one

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,789
segment on a 110 and you need to get us

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,919
into signal to another device that's on

00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:35,460
the other one well effectively the

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,370
signal has to go all the way back out to

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,460
not only the house but sometimes out to

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,750
the street out to the transformer ok

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,640
that's wherever that is in your

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,830
neighbourhood and then it's got to come

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,260
back out again to get onto that other

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,260
face alright and this is why sometimes

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,409
you see propagation problems within

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,210
within the particular design one cool

00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:59,549
thing way to fix this and unfortunate

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,860
this this part is no longer in

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:02,580
production but there is a secondary part

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,010
that is available

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,380
is something that will actually combine

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,330
the two phases within your home and

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,820
you're thinking well that sounds really

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,950
risky right like why would I want to do

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,630
that and you know wouldn't I kill myself

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,720
and don't have to get electrician well

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:20,880
if you have anything that runs on 220

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,890
within your home are there are devices

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,860
that you can buy which will combine the

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,539
two phases within your home basically we

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,519
think about it when you're when you got

00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:31,500
this thing plugged in and it's running

00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,899
it's running on both phases isn't it

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,549
because it's running on 220 so there's

00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:39,750
just sort of certain devices in your

00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:42,720
home that have 220 natively the classic

00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,610
case would be X 10 ones great when I'm

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,519
running my dryer but when my bro dryer

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,960
is not running it won't work right I

00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,820
don't think you want to keep your dryer

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,909
running but they have developed some

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,590
very sophisticated devices which will

00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,960
plug basically what happens is the

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,909
device plugs into your 220 and then you

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,250
plug your dryer or your air conditioner

00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:04,350
into the the back of the device so it's

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,789
basically like piggyback between your

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,850
two twenty devices and the electrical

00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:10,649
power and then again it actually it

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,269
actually bridges them together again

00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:15,350
this device would not be the one we

00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:19,380
would use we would use basically what we

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:21,899
basically a split phase joiners what

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:26,850
they call it which allows their signals

00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:28,860
to come to come through much better this

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,860
is another diagram kind of talking about

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,590
the issue with split phase and and one

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,620
of the problems that you have is that

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,820
the two phases are often opposite from

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,370
each other as you can see from the

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,740
diagram the right bottom right there and

00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,149
again this kind of fixes that as well to

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,539
make sure that they're they're kind of

00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,980
synchronized these devices you know

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,830
they're not cheaper like I think I

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,110
bought one it was sixty dollars I think

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,730
so it wasn't you know but again I was

00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,500
already down the road at this point so

00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,820
you got it it's almost like you got a

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,350
bootstrapped of thing it's like getting

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,610
on the internet well the internet goes

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,529
nobody cares about the internet until

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,730
you can do something cool and then we

00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,769
can do something cool everyone wants to

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,049
be on it well you've got to get to that

00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:12,179
point and then once you kind of cover

00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,140
that hurdle the sixty dollars doesn't

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,090
doesn't feel too bad

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,070
line noise somebody mentioned the

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,750
problem with complex for essence the big

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,230
farm I've seen is not so much complex

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,510
fluorescence but UPS devices so

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,780
Universal on your interrupted power

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:32,150
supplies that actually sit between the

00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,550
electoral system in my computer you know

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,290
what those other group dual power

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:40,100
supplies are also supposed to do they're

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:43,880
supposed to clean the power and you know

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,220
what x10 looks like noise right so

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,120
obviously you got this device in your

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,700
house that would basically hates x10 and

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,710
wants to basically suppress all that

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,970
line noise that you're trying to get to

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,160
propagate through your whole house so

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,710
the only I have not seen complex for us

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,990
in problems as much as I've seen ups

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,200
problems so I actually had the bio

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:10,390
device that sits between my ups and the

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,740
electrical plug which will isolate that

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,760
compaction basically isolate the server

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,590
at the UPS from the rest of the network

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,840
and that actually that actually worked

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,280
really well one of the real downsides

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,410
frankly with electrical power

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,950
distribution electrical signals is that

00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:29,000
you have to do a lot of this diagnosis

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,860
that unless you're bringing in an expert

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,570
who's done this before you can say okay

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,470
that's going to be problem that's going

00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,810
to be a problem that's going to be a

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,760
problem I know how to fix all those you

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,710
end up sort of being the guinea pig and

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,100
having this sort of experiment and

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:45,410
figure out well if i unplug the UPS then

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,060
oh my extent works but if i plug it in

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,010
it doesn't work right if my dryers

00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,010
running extra words my drawers not

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,810
running extend doesn't work right so you

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,790
have to kind of do some research to kind

00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,680
of learn how this works and it's very

00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,990
frustrating and the other problem is

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,630
that as you add devices to your system

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,520
as you as you plug devices into your

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:07,040
house you have the potential each device

00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,110
has a potential to somehow adversely

00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,290
affect this so there are some new

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,880
technologies that have come around

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,790
universal power bus z-wave I mentioned

00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,950
insteon which eventually basically say

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,740
okay this electrical system idea works

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:24,500
but we really need a different way doing

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,510
it I believe the universal power bus

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,340
actually sends a different frequency

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,340
signal across

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,580
your network has it has a distance limit

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,669
of a mile okay so all of a sudden you

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,490
have a much more capable system which

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:42,620
basically can do a lot more without the

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,320
type of downsides of trying to send the

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,690
part of the data across this network the

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,299
downside is that the prices are fairly

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,970
expensive so again it's a little harder

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:54,020
to get involved with but again when

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,730
you're doing I'm gonna make sure you say

00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,740
okay how much am I willing to spend up

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,750
front where I think I'm going and then

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:04,039
you know sort of what technology really

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:06,799
fits best for me so that's enough about

00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:10,340
x 10 or the actual electrical technology

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,970
lets actually see what it does right in

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:17,690
this case we have a diagram of my house

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,990
this is the first floor as you can see

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,179
on the left we have the garage on the

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,090
right the family room and then so forth

00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:27,860
now each of the circles the yellow

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,190
circles basically represents a light

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,750
bulb or multiple light bulbs so

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,070
effectively if you look at the front of

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,049
the house which happens to be at the

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,210
bottom here you can see a whole bunch of

00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:42,409
lighting at the front of the house that

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:44,570
actually is controlled by x 10 okay many

00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:46,159
of these required an electrician to put

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:48,860
in because I had to actually replace

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,299
switches and I didn't really need

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,669
electrician to put the switches in

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:55,520
except that they were three-way switches

00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:58,190
which means that when you put in a

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,190
three-way switch you have to make sure

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:04,700
that the x10 device has to be on the

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,350
load side of the circuit and I didn't

00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,970
really know how to do that so I brought

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,059
an electrician and he was able to do it

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,500
for me but again when you would normally

00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,429
the way the three there's a whole bunch

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,950
of different ways you can wire a

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,390
three-way switch but usually one of them

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,899
is on a load side and one of them is on

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:22,760
the ground side if you put the switch if

00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:24,980
you put the x10 detector on the ground

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,049
side affected the electricity is going

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,840
through the switch through the bulb and

00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:32,090
then coming to the ground before you see

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,529
that signal and obviously there's all

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:37,309
sorts of distortions that can happen

00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:39,830
when they go around so the front of the

00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,610
house actually has some lights there to

00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,679
turn those lights on I used to have a

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,500
dawn and dusk sensor that wasn't

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,120
reliable enough I end up going out and

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,660
writing a little script it goes out to

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,950
the internet finds out when sundown is

00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,750
goes to the weather service finds out

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,490
what the quote the cloud cover is and

00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,890
then I could basically predict when I

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,600
want these lights to go on and I didn't

00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:04,380
necessarily want the lights to go on all

00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,120
the way so I actually dim them because I

00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,770
find that most houses if you've ever

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,660
seen you ever see a house that has like

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,549
one really blight bright bulb and you're

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,200
like you know this really is not working

00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:15,059
here because the house just doesn't look

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,820
right because it's just this one huge

00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:19,590
porch bulb on this huge house and it's

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,690
usually too bright so basically one of

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:24,030
the nice things with x10 is that you can

00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,100
control how much electricity is getting

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,290
to that bulb so you can basically go

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,780
outside as I did with my laptop and

00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,280
basically at night and I'm based like

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,570
okay I want this to be a little brighter

00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,240
over here I want this to be a little

00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,970
darker and you can actually sort of sort

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,700
of tableaux your house okay to kind of

00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,679
give it a certain light effect which

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,419
obviously you can't do unless you want

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,820
to go out and buy a bazillion bulbs

00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,049
wattages they don't make okay and try

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,970
screwing the man until they actually

00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,040
look the way you want them to which I

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,720
don't think you're going to do so again

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,400
this is sort of the case where you're

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,179
using your home automation to do stuff

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,160
that you couldn't really do on your own

00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:03,660
if that's not crazy enough you're like

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,240
you know I kind of like the way it looks

00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:09,120
but I'm not sure if that's really the

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,580
optimal thing to do so let's let's add a

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,320
little randomness in here so every day

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,790
the lights are a little different right

00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,400
there a little brighter on some places

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,929
they're a little darker and others yes

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,490
it's kind it's not really a light show

00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:23,400
they don't actually change during the

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:26,030
night or they could write but it does

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,049
give it a little bit of a variability

00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,669
you'll drive in the house you're like oh

00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:31,110
wow the porch is really bright today or

00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:33,299
oh the you know the front doors a little

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,100
brighter or whatever sometimes it gets

00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,940
kind of dim in certain parts but again

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,220
you know you just got a little

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,669
variability there and it adds a little

00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,559
excitement any questions before we going

00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:47,250
to stay on the slide though so those are

00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,110
the light bulbs in the front as you can

00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,690
see the server is right here and we're

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,320
going to be talking about that

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,030
a couple minutes the we also have

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,630
something called chimes there are the

00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:01,340
actual red things here the red red boxes

00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,590
you see those and they're in different

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,810
parts of the house so we had a case

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,050
where we need certain times we need to

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,730
tell everybody it's time to eat or come

00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,120
down and do something or somebody is on

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:17,030
the phone it's important like me right

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,310
so it turns out that when i call the

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,560
house it looks at the caller ID and then

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,140
it it makes a noise so they know that

00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,880
who's on the phone basically but the

00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,470
problem particularly with the with the

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,960
kitchen bell which is how this all

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,990
started was it I used to have a speaker

00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,640
in the computer room and when my wife

00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,220
would say is ok it's time to eat it

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,830
would make this big chime sound well I

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,480
know how many of you been like in clock

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,360
towers or bell towers but you know what

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,310
nothing Ryan's it's really loud and

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,650
that's really not a great system because

00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,760
if anyone was in the computer room at

00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,820
the time they got like the shock of

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,510
their life ok and if I tried taking the

00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:58,070
volume down then basically they click

00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,470
here in the rest of the house right so

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,820
you've got this sort of problem where

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,830
you want to distribute the sound kind of

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,120
evenly throughout the house and you

00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,860
don't want to basically blow out the

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,530
years of the guy who happens to be in

00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:13,010
the office right so the solution there

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:15,050
were was that they do make certain charm

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,520
devices that you can again just plug

00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,970
into the wall just I think I have a

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,850
picture one right somewhere no I don't

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:26,990
have a picture sorry about that let me

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:28,430
straighten up here so you have you

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,480
basically have these charm device you

00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,310
can put them different places in the

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,580
house and they make a little ding dong

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:36,560
sound ok and again you can place them at

00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,970
strategic points in the house when you

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,070
decide you want to ring the bell it

00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,830
makes sort of a pleasant sound at a

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,700
reasonable volume universally throughout

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:48,960
the house which again is something

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,790
with a single speaker what else do we

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,500
have here well let's see we have the

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:59,310
green which are actually a wireless

00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,920
remote so you basically have like a wire

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:03,780
like a you know via remote for a TV well

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,730
now you have a remote for your lights so

00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,980
if you want to turn off lights if you're

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,359
going to watch a movie you don't have to

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,530
go in and turn off every way you can

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,570
basically just go to the remote and say

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,960
turn off the lights and then they go off

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,940
in that room and it's kind of convenient

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,710
again you wouldn't think of a remote for

00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,270
a light bulb but it actually works

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:25,560
really well particularly when like the

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,650
room is dark and you're watching

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,450
something and then somebody wants to get

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,740
up well how do you find the light to

00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,000
turn it on because the room is dark

00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,740
because you're watching something right

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,150
i mean you know the this chicken egg

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,520
thing so you've had a little remote

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,910
control you can turn all the lights so

00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,609
that actually works really well let's

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,290
see we have so we talked about that we

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,089
got the wireless remotes which allow you

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,680
to turn on or off lights through her we

00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:52,680
got the coffee maker which is always a

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,210
big win obviously you can turn on and

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,410
off electrical devices really easy if

00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,480
you can turn on bulbs you can turn off

00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,640
electro devices Eddie you can plug in

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:07,079
call if you make you plug in bingo it

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:08,940
works ok I'm sorry yes in fact part of

00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,920
the demonstration we have my wife has a

00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,589
little button on her phone which says

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,300
coffee oh I'm sorry the question was can

00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:18,630
you do can you do it with your

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,910
smartphone and yes you can there's

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,240
basically a program to button and she

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:27,060
just hits it and then it turns it on so

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:31,079
she can assuming somebody sets up the

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,510
coffee maker right then effectively she

00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,160
can go out somewhere and then when she's

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,660
on her way home she can hit the button

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,180
and know the whole food be ready by the

00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,349
time she gets home which makes means

00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,270
that I don't have to turn on the coffee

00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:45,810
maker because I usually don't do it very

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:48,030
well and she can basically kind of

00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,119
control it and my aunt is happy to set

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,940
it up so actually it's a great system

00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,750
and also there's a you can also turn it

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,880
on with a remote so there's a

00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,680
there's a remote in the bathroom so that

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,360
takes your shower she hits the button

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,320
but time she comes down coffee's ready

00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,550
right again not I don't think I don't

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,550
think half of these things you're going

00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:12,010
to use but again you start to think of

00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:14,350
okay what can I automate that works for

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,490
my for my family right if there's going

00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,050
to be things you're going to think about

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,630
that have nothing to do with what I'm

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,160
doing but when you start to see okay

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,320
what repetitive things that was my

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,140
family doing what ways can I make that

00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,820
more efficient what makes can I can I do

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,110
stuff that they didn't really wanted

00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,180
that they didn't really know they wanted

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:33,880
to do then you start to see some of the

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:37,420
potential that you can do with with the

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,570
home automation let's go to the next

00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,130
slide this is actually the second floor

00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:46,510
all the pool pump is not on a second

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:48,400
floor but you get the idea so again you

00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:51,130
have you can see a number of these

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,320
wireless remotes the green boxes that

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,180
are in different parts of the house you

00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,250
see a couple of the red chimes you see a

00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,380
couple of the bulbs okay some of these

00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:02,230
lights go on with tie it with with cron

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,030
jobs from the server so again that's all

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,790
kind of controlled centrally from one

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:09,790
location the wireless remote actually

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,500
here is really cool it's a very small

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,540
remote and you just hit a button and

00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,280
then all the lights in the house co off

00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,410
so instead of sort of having to shut off

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,390
all the lights to go upstairs or shut

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,730
the lights off to get in the bed you can

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:25,210
basically just get in bed hit a button

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:27,340
boom the whole house goes off so it does

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,050
make it easier for you to basically not

00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:33,040
have to go around and do a lot of manual

00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,690
turning on turning off that that doesn't

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,120
it doesn't work too well I mean the

00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,430
classic case is like you go in the

00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,890
bedroom you flip the light on switch

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,990
that's on the wall you get ready for bed

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,000
but then if you get up to turn the

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,470
switch off then you can't find the bed

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,600
because it's so dark in the room now

00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,920
right so when you go and you turn on the

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,930
light next to the next to the build menu

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,580
go to turn off the light and you go pay

00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,250
so anyway you see what's kind of going

00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:04,780
on so that's how you the pool pump is

00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:06,730
kind of cool that basically again if

00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,900
you've ever had to do a pool it's got a

00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,490
timer on a usual

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,950
it's gotta run a certain number towns in

00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:14,410
you know an hour or add a certain number

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,480
hours a day one of the cool things is

00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,430
that the warmer it is the more it has to

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,900
run so you can actually go out to find

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,420
out the temperature and then run your

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,869
pool pump more or less depending on how

00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,010
hard it is right so you save electricity

00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:29,079
it actually keeps your pool cleaner

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,640
because it knows kind of this is a big

00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,130
deal like September it isn't going to

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,420
run as much it is in July and again I'm

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,130
not about to go out there and like

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,799
fiddle with the little time or every

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,329
time I just not going to do it right so

00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:42,789
this kind of takes that away from me I

00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:46,569
travel a lot too so if I don't have to

00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:47,559
deal with it it's kind of better you

00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:49,089
know because I'm not going to be here

00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,369
all the time to petition all with this

00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,869
stuff so what is it what is it some of

00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:55,059
these things look like this is actually

00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:57,099
a switch on a wall the the one on the

00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,470
right is a traditional switch the one on

00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:02,170
the left is a push button next 10 why is

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,880
it a push button well because it can be

00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,559
turned on and off remotely as well so we

00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,960
can't really use an up and down switch

00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:09,940
in the same way although there are some

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,579
cases where you could but again they

00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,500
just went with a button this is a rocker

00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,450
switch again just for different day

00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,369
cooler press the button it goes on or

00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:22,450
off it again has similar computer

00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:24,339
control this is a three-way switch and

00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:29,799
you can see there's a bunch of them some

00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:31,900
of them are actually well in a three-way

00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:33,190
switch you have one detector switch and

00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,130
one non detector switch you can see

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:38,950
it'll go different this is actually a

00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,599
wireless switch which we you wouldn't

00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,010
think was possible and actually relates

00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:43,660
to what I talked about originally words

00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,940
somebody wanted to switch somewhere so

00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,619
this is just a plate that sits on the

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,480
wall so you basically just take the

00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,730
plate you take the stick them off the

00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,970
back and you just go okay stick it on

00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,430
the wall right how does that work well

00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,839
there's a little like watch battery in

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:01,869
there that lasts for like a couple years

00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:04,089
and when you press the button it sends a

00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:06,010
wireless signal not extent but a

00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:08,500
wireless signal and there's a detector

00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,809
which has low antenna on it right and

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,690
the antenna picks up the signal from

00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:15,279
this thing and it sends an x 10 signal

00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,200
across your network for you know

00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:19,599
whatever you've programmed you can

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,900
program these buttons to be certain

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,610
device numbers and

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,930
when you say or on for that device

00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,030
number this thing picks up the signal

00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,070
sends a signal across the wireless

00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,170
network and then turn and then whether

00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,970
that wherever that device is plugged in

00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,460
somewhere else it's going to turn it on

00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:37,070
okay so the cool thing is not only is

00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,040
their control along the power system but

00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,110
we now have remote controls we now have

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,240
sort of wireless switches which on't

00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,250
have two don't need an electrician can

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,240
be put anywhere you have to put a hole

00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,550
in the wall you can move it around

00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,320
whatever you want and the battery

00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,700
suppress the surprising long time you

00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,660
it's kind of interesting how well that

00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:59,540
works this is actually the remote next

00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,490
to the bed the the eff the full button

00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,670
is the one that shuts off everything so

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,020
if you press that this button right here

00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,180
you just get that there's this like sort

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:19,010
of sound which is like everything just

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:20,420
shuts down yes okay so does that do

00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:23,060
anything with the power know it does

00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,890
nothing with the power effectively it's

00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,590
merely sending a signal to the light to

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:30,590
go off somebody can just put a button

00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:33,200
and turn it on again in fact I think you

00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,940
know subconsciously we have four kids

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,320
like when it gets to be midnight and

00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,910
we're going to bed and some kids are

00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,950
still up but like you know I'm gonna hit

00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,480
that button right you know you know if

00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,680
they want to stay up there going to get

00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,050
off and they're going to turn the light

00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,790
on please it's going to push them up in

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,160
fact I've gotten a little tricky because

00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,960
I don't know if you're this way but if

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,060
you're in your house and all your lights

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,070
are on like I could stay up till like

00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,900
one or two o'clock because it's like oh

00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,110
what's wrong right I mean you just

00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,850
there's this sense that that well it's

00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,800
not my time because there's all these

00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,240
lights here and subconsciously you just

00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,370
think i'm just going to keep working

00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,800
because i got a lot of light here and i

00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:12,200
don't feel tired so one of the tricks i

00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,730
started to do was to actually program

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,550
the lights to kind of start to shut off

00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:19,490
so certain lights will turn on at dusk

00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:22,370
but as it gets later at night more

00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,990
lights will start to shut off and in

00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,240
fact i programmed it so when he gets to

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,430
midnight all the lights go off even if

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,470
you're downstairs because like if that

00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:32,660
didn't get you up then all right you can

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,480
get up and turn a light on yourself but

00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,670
hopefully that

00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,140
going to kind of push you to get up

00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,340
because you know the sense they're going

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,280
to come up at the right at the same time

00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:44,190
whether you stay up or not so there's a

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,280
certain psychological thing that you can

00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,109
program in there to basically defeat

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,790
what the light is doing to your sleep

00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:52,369
patterns and that is extending it you

00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,660
know I mean before they had electricity

00:43:52,369 --> 00:43:55,980
people went to bed like 830 right

00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,150
because that's you couldn't do much at

00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,609
night and you got up real early because

00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,240
that's when the Sun got up what happens

00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:05,190
is with the electrical light bulb he now

00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,470
your day is now extended people don't

00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,270
get as much sleep and you it kind of

00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,700
plays with your your psychology a little

00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:14,250
bit so I'm going to fight that I'm going

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,080
to play the other direction so yeah so

00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,060
they can they can shut it on and in fact

00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,619
if she hits this button or I'll hit that

00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,010
button then the lights in the house go

00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:25,080
on everywhere so you know if for some

00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,660
reason you just want it all lights on or

00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,470
you heard a noise you know what it was

00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,910
ternal all lights on you're not going to

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,920
be crawling downstairs in the door

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:33,810
because everything's going to be on I

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,119
don't think we've ever used it but it's

00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,980
there right and of course you can

00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,600
control the dimness of the bulbs and so

00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,250
forth and these other but lights these

00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,650
actually control other lights in the

00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,970
bedroom itself so you know Charlie the

00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:53,850
light to read or whatever you would use

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:55,710
that yes so could you you could you set

00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,790
it up to send it can signal the computer

00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,950
automatically shut it down yet

00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:00,000
absolutely you could yes in fact I'm

00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,000
going to talk about the computer

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,380
interface in just a minute okay so this

00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,920
is another example this is the remote

00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,780
right here sitting on the table again if

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,160
you wanted to control it this is

00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,690
actually the pool pump this is the

00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,390
switch right here and this is the the

00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,760
pump I think right there right yeah

00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,230
right that piece right there so that

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,109
actually again control turns it on and

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,700
off there is actually an open source

00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:26,600
program called hey you which will a

00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:29,040
basically could turn things on and off

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:32,580
it works really well it'll basically

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,530
control x 10 signals you can send on dim

00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,359
whatever and you can script these things

00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,480
real easily here's an example of a cron

00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:42,480
job I'm basically saying OK at nine

00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,490
o'clock turn off the bookcase light okay

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,950
and then a ten o'clock turn off the

00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,599
front lights and eleven o'clock turn off

00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:52,490
the Tiffany light in the family room you

00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:55,290
can see it kind of going down okay

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:57,750
there's actually a pool pump although I

00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,220
don't see it listed here here's one that

00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,420
will turn on the bathroom light which is

00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,400
not really a bathroom but it's like

00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,810
hallway light this'll turn on the

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,670
Christmas lights or think and I think we

00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:09,540
need decor because there's a bunch of

00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:12,210
little lights to come on around 10am and

00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,619
then you can do sort of group stuff so

00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,420
this is actually the thing it shuts off

00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:18,660
everything at night it shuts off

00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,550
everything in the first group but but it

00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,859
doesn't shut off the entry table entry

00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:25,230
way because the entryway light at the

00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:26,579
bottom it was right for the stairs and

00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,260
you know people going to need that to

00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,329
get upstairs so I'm like I here's what

00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:35,369
follow right ok let's go go up the

00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:38,400
stairs go to bed so again there's and

00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:41,280
then there's this is there's even some

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,119
beaming you can do to do some to some

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,160
kind of stuff that makes sense I talked

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,609
about computer control this is actually

00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:53,579
a pretty lousy picture of the device

00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:56,190
that actually controls the computer so

00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:58,740
effectively this device plugs into the

00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:02,310
power and it has a serial cable that

00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:06,089
goes out into the server okay so hey you

00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:08,280
basically can listen to see what extent

00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:12,030
activity is happening in the house so if

00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,730
somebody hits a wireless remote I will

00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,770
see that signal coming across and the

00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,599
computer will see it and I actually have

00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:23,099
a cron job it actually looks like this

00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:24,839
so it'll say okay on this date although

00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,119
there's no year I don't know why you

00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:30,690
know these activities happen so this is

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:33,480
actually i think the something happened

00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:36,119
with the dusk sensor and then my

00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,869
daughter I guess turned off the light

00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:42,510
and this I think I was going to bed at

00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:45,900
eleven 18 that day that we were actually

00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:48,420
pressing the that f4 button to shut

00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,310
everything off and again I have asked

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,950
Ron thing which will go through and

00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:55,500
basically listens so it runs hey you

00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:57,030
which I call x10 and it just runs it in

00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,369
monitor mode and then this is just a

00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,920
shell script the girl students is ok I

00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:01,960
sauce

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,530
somebody hit thank you it's so somebody

00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:13,450
hit uh are you sure on that number time

00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:20,380
there why the wrong time I the books is

00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:22,510
1115 that's why I'm oh there is oh okay

00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,690
great i did not know that good you said

00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,700
something so effectively we're going to

00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,080
we're basically running through the cron

00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,330
script and when we see some activity

00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,000
that matches something we're going to

00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,680
trigger you know for example here they

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,140
it's dusk time so we're going to

00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,050
actually turn on we're going to turn on

00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,670
all these lights and then 45 minutes

00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,220
later I'm going to turn on some other

00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:47,260
lights so this actually related to a

00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:51,400
problem where the dust sensor would go

00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:53,710
on and then my then the front lights

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,290
would go on at the same time and my wife

00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,580
would say well you know it doesn't look

00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,190
right that the lights are going on that

00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:02,200
early but well it's desk like what do

00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,850
want me to do and it's like well we

00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,550
either lives on inside but we don't need

00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,680
them on outside yet it just looks silly

00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,210
so I'm like all right well I'll just

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,520
wait and I'll schedule something to

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,310
happen 45 minutes after the dusk sensor

00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,260
happens okay and that's exactly what

00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:19,150
what that's doing it gives you idea

00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,190
here's the kitchen chime and you're

00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,920
actually saying time to eat and here

00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,420
we're actually sending the bell across

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,220
the whole system so she has a little

00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,620
remote she presses and then it basically

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:34,240
says time to eat and it even says it on

00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:35,920
the laptops okay so this is where the

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,330
computer is and again the computer can

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,820
do all these things again this

00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:42,430
presentation is on the website if you're

00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:46,750
curious but it can send signal turn on

00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:49,330
the lights it actually gets Sun try

00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:52,810
sunset information it can receive

00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:55,660
information from wireless receivers it

00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:59,530
can it can basically do all this kind of

00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:01,000
stuff here you know at dusk to do to do

00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,340
a whole bunch of things when it

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,780
determines the house is getting door the

00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,930
last thing I want to talk about which I

00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:11,430
have three minutes is the telephone

00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:13,250
interface the telephone interface

00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:15,680
basically is in

00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,040
credibly crude but it works really well

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,740
if that looks like a modem to you it is

00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:24,830
I don't use it as a modem although I did

00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:28,520
in my UCP days effectively what i'm

00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:31,160
doing here is I am many of you might not

00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:34,280
know that modems actually will do caller

00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:38,900
ID so you can basically plug your

00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:41,300
telephone into this Jack here okay and

00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,560
it will get caller ID sig looks just

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,320
like a caller ID with a show up on a

00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,720
phone it's showing up on the modem well

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,550
if you listen if you connect to the

00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,590
modem and just listen all the time I

00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,810
know it sounds crazy but usually just

00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,510
you open the modem and you just listen

00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,790
for stuff to come in effectively you get

00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:00,980
things that look like this this is the

00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:04,580
raw data that's coming through the modem

00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:07,730
ok so it's saying on this day I got a

00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:11,510
call from this number is actually my

00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:13,250
cell phone in Pennsylvania ok so I have

00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:15,110
a script that will just as I have a

00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:17,000
script that's listening to all the x10

00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:19,280
activity I have another scripts is

00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,490
listening to all the caller ID activity

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,100
and when I get some caller ID I

00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:28,670
basically take the telephone number I go

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,650
to my rolodex or my Mike White address

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,030
book my telephone address book and I

00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,620
look to see is that number match

00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,350
anything in my address book and if it

00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:39,620
does I can print some really nice text

00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:41,810
here that says hey you know at that time

00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,190
boosting Christine are calling from the

00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,110
cell phone and that happens to be the

00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:47,030
number and I can optionally sound a

00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:50,420
charm for certain people if they are

00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:52,160
part of the family okay so just again

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,930
just to have x 10 and i look for

00:51:52,160 --> 00:52:00,410
activity and I can do trigger things in

00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:03,500
the same way I can basically listen for

00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:05,500
caller ID ID activity do things like I

00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:09,200
log every call that comes into the house

00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:11,660
okay I can dial the phone too I can

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,820
actually I can actually hook up my

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,140
address book so I don't have to go if I

00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,240
just want to call somebody I just go

00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:20,720
like da you know I just go to the

00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,970
rolodex I hit C for cell phone or W for

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,290
work or H for home it says you won or

00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,300
lie

00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:27,100
too well I don't want boom dolls the

00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,900
photo just pick up the phone I don't

00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,970
type it out because frankly I get it

00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,150
wrong half the time anyway and it's just

00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:39,100
not a good use of my time okay so not

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:41,440
only can you use the caller ID okay not

00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,840
only can use the caller ID I've just

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,840
gained another five minutes not only can

00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,030
use the quality to get to get

00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:53,290
information coming in but you can also

00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:55,510
use it to dial out okay so family

00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:57,700
suggestions and again I think this gives

00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:00,850
me a little time to have a very tiny

00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:02,200
demo in in the session and I'm going to

00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:07,210
do my best to see what I can do with

00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:09,130
that okay so um basically family

00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:11,080
suggestions adding orientation changes

00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,710
your family's home environment be

00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:16,330
careful start small I will tell you one

00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:18,790
of the tricks that I learned actually

00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,050
from this book here which happens to be

00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:23,110
an o'reilly book about home automation

00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:27,190
is start slow and make incremental

00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:29,080
changes okay do something in home

00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:31,750
automation and then let it sit for a

00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,820
month and wait to see how your family

00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:36,670
reacts and wait to see if your family

00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:38,470
comes back to you and says you know it

00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,600
would be real you know it's really I'm

00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,890
getting used to this thing and then we

00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,190
really need if you could do this other

00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,810
thing okay then you know then you know

00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:52,300
you've won but don't do that thing right

00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:55,030
away okay wait two weeks okay then do

00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,950
that thing that they want and then if

00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:59,050
that's successful then you can you can

00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,030
kind of start to move along and you get

00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,410
less criticism of what you're doing

00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,090
because now your family's kind of

00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:05,680
invested in it it's sort of a

00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,000
psychological thing but you may be likes

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,680
the environment to be changed nobody

00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,950
wants to change from Windows to Linux or

00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,710
linux ubuntu or god forbid they change

00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:16,630
genome 223 right i mean it's just yeah

00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:20,560
it's an inside joke but it drives people

00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:23,380
crazy it's driving me crazy frankly so

00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,640
so people don't like change forced upon

00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,560
them they want to be really in control

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,000
that and your family's home is like your

00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,140
family's home so that's really the last

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,200
environment they want you to be

00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:35,930
tinkering with so you often want to

00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:38,450
start very slow go small

00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:41,510
don't try and take on everything at once

00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:43,370
but as you see it working with your

00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:45,770
family then you can kind of continue to

00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:48,230
do more stuff except that some home

00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:50,030
animation tests are not possible I don't

00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,500
think motion sensor I've never done in

00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,780
one motion sensor I just don't think it

00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,000
works reliably enough for what I'm doing

00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:58,550
I'd rather find something that I can

00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,590
really measure and again because of the

00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,700
way the system is all automated and

00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,140
controlled and I can get on the internet

00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,060
and I can do all these crazy things for

00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:08,150
my server there's a lot of things I can

00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:10,130
do very reliably I don't need that I

00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:13,640
just found and found I need I need

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,230
motion sensing very much and because a

00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,150
lot of times you have the probably like

00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:19,220
you walk in the room and then it takes

00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:21,140
five seconds for the light to come on or

00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,790
something it's just really awkward and I

00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,200
think it just kind of defeats your

00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,480
purpose I'm not saying it doesn't work

00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,030
I'm saying be prepared for some things

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,970
you're not going to be doable or

00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:33,620
acceptable and again at the end you have

00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:37,700
succeeded when your family asks for home

00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:39,140
automation editions okay so that's a

00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,410
book that I use to kind of get some

00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:45,490
ideas you know don't end up like how

00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,500
which ends up killing is residents okay

00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:50,540
I do have another talk which I'm not

00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:53,090
going to be able to cover again it's

00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:55,640
basically just it's another way of

00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:57,020
looking at home automation I'll just

00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,540
kind of fly through it really fast very

00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,480
similar to what you saw before but it's

00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:05,350
basically more oriented toward sort of a

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,030
dataflow approach to home automation

00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:10,610
looking at sort of how to run rate some

00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:12,830
of these scripts basically having

00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:15,440
somebody press some caller ID comes in

00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:17,570
and all these things happen again a

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,950
little more kind of software oriented

00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:24,050
dialing the the you know dialing from a

00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:27,140
directory and so forth doing things like

00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:29,210
outside temperature activity you know

00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:31,520
activity from your family for somebody

00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:34,130
presses a button you know it does all

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,530
these kind of things so again just if

00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:41,900
you ever find it useful feel free to use

00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:45,560
that so for the huge tiny amount of time

00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:49,290
I have remaining what I'm going to try

00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:53,160
and do is I don't I don't think I have

00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:59,940
internet so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:56:53,160 --> 00:57:06,510
going to call my house there we go and

00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:12,530
I'm going to see if this will work so I

00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:15,920
got the speaker on hey are you there

00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:17,610
okay can you guys here's okay so

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:25,110
unfortunate don't seem to have any

00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:27,620
internet Matthew yeah so that was the

00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:30,090
house talking that would be pretty cool

00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:32,670
so I'm not sure what we can actually do

00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:34,860
here I guess maybe I could call and we

00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:37,500
could hear it go ding ding does that

00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:40,110
work oh yeah why don't you call the

00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:43,940
house babe here we go what's going to

00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:43,940
call nearest one hold on

00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,200
the phone ring now

00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,820
well it's not going to work yeah I what

00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,610
I was really hoping to do was to use

00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,080
gmail and get the video working and then

00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,480
basically allow you to see the lights

00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,700
going on and off unfortunately my phone

00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,890
is not fast enough to do that here and

00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,680
the internet locally is not fast enough

00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,180
to do video so anyway we tried so thanks

00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,190
very much appreciate I will be up here

00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,790
for questions I have run out of time

00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,790
thank you

00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:31,160
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:33,380
ago we could not have imagined that

00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,599
asterisk would not only become the most

00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,730
widely adopted open source communication

00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,770
software on the planet but that it would

00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:42,290
impact the entire industry in the way

00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:44,270
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:46,910
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:48,859
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:50,930
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:52,339
transition of power from the hands of

00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:54,619
the traditional proprietary phone

00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:57,020
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:58,940
administrators of phone systems using

00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,170
this power our customers have created

00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,119
all sorts of business changing

00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,980
applications from small office phone

00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,500
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:08,089
to international carrier networks in

00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,890
fact there's even an entire country

00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:12,260
those communications infrastructure runs

00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:14,390
on esters the gym has always been about

00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:16,130
creating technology that expands

00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,290
communications capabilities in ways that

00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,490
we could never have imagined and that's

00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:21,859
part of what's game-changing about

00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:24,559
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:26,660
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,790
IP phones that extends control of the

00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,530
user all the way to the desktop the

00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:32,240
launch of these new products represents

00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:34,339
the next phase indigenous history of

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,740
innovation these are the first and only

00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:38,089
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,770
power of esther's when we first

00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:41,420
discussed our expectations for building

00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:44,030
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,799
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,569
asked the team to build the phones such

00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:49,760
that they were easy to install integrate

00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:51,619
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,170
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:59:51,619 --> 00:59:55,819
that goal user feedback is validating

00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,920
that when it comes to operation with

00:59:55,819 --> 01:00:00,349
astro space systems including our own

00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,930
Switchvox based product these are the

01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:04,220
easiest to use best integrated most

01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:06,829
interoperable products on the market

01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,799
today the digitally of phones will

01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:10,910
initially include three IP des hommes

01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,799
uniquely designed to complement any

01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,690
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:17,359
these phones are different for a number

01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:20,000
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:21,440
designed for use with asterisks secondly

01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,049
we've made it really easy to

01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,430
autodiscover and revision the phones

01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:27,109
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:29,080
to access information inside of

01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:31,080
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,070
between an application and the phone

01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,200
additionally we've created an

01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:37,330
applications engine that allows users

01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,570
and developers to create and run their

01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:42,340
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,290
done all of this at a very compelling

01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,970
price point at digium we're always

01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:48,070
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:50,590
the best value in business phone systems

01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:52,300
and also give them the power to create

01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:54,340
their own solutions or eating

01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,050
communications challenge will continue

01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,490
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:59,530
Astra's cooler bastard more

01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:01,150
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:03,640
asterisk and web communications even

01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:07,350
easier and together we'll change the way

01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,350
the world communicates again

01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:55,229
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:51,929 --> 01:01:57,390
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:55,229 --> 01:02:00,869
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:04,669
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:08,189
happening in open source the

01:02:04,669 --> 01:02:09,989
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:12,119
of the community and the speed at which

01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:14,099
these are these you know these these

01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,380
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:19,259
discovered and then fixed is it I think

01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:22,259
that really shows the power of the of

01:02:19,259 --> 01:02:24,709
the open source community it is global

01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:28,259
and it's definitely because of the users

01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:34,140
community people are extremely friendly

01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:35,939
and always ready to help if you go an

01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,159
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:02:35,939 --> 01:02:40,799
helping each other out and they're all

01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,479
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,499
product is transparent for everyone

01:02:42,479 --> 01:02:48,689
everyone can look at the code base

01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:50,900
everyone can see how close duck is being

01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:56,400
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:59,009
everything is open in many ways it's

01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:03,509
absolutely vital to the the unborn

01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:07,709
health CloudStack the most exciting

01:03:03,509 --> 01:03:10,570
event in recent memory for me was our

01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:13,180
first developer boot camp

01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:15,820
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:19,690
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:23,980
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:26,800
up with 87 people and had to go get more

01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:29,350
chairs in the room twice everything

01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,590
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:35,650
is open source and so I don't think that

01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:37,420
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:40,450
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:43,150
computing and so i think it's i think

01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:44,500
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,640
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:51,190
talking about open source cloud

01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:54,220
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:56,350
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:03:54,220 --> 01:04:00,610
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:03:56,350 --> 01:04:03,310
in each data center is these hardware is

01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:06,790
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:09,490
to handle number one that mass scale

01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:12,670
number two it's designed to handle the

01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:15,190
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:19,720
deployments we started working on pop

01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:22,990
deck over four years ago and it was the

01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,760
original set of people working on it had

01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:28,870
a background of delivering software

01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:33,100
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:36,730
lots of users actually using it high

01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:39,820
availability is the key feature multiple

01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:41,830
hypervisors support different network

01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:44,500
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:46,750
you better while step management server

01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:50,470
can be deployed in different physical

01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:52,120
machines it definitely has a huge

01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:57,100
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:59,680
there's a major movie studio that they

01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,860
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,960
to transcode video and i thought that

01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:06,610
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,880
more fascinating is what they did during

01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:12,670
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,020
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,640
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:17,910
the instance

01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,460
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:22,230
vast it touches so many different

01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:24,089
aspects and there's no one person that's

01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:27,750
kind of like a master of all those

01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:30,630
realms I think clouds stack as a project

01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:32,910
is going to be one of the leaders simply

01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:37,589
because it's some of the most feature

01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:42,089
fallen and and robust platforms out

01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:44,599
there I don't senior living through the

01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:44,599
clouds dag
