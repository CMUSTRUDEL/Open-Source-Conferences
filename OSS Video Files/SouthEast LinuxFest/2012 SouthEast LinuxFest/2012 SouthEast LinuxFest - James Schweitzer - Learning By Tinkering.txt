the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

more information about the southeast

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,439
linux fest visit w wh linux pc org the

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,609
the following diamond sponsors in 2012

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,869
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:33,090
good morning welcome to self 2012 this

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,579
is mr. James Schweitzer he works with

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,200
open source at IBM and he's going to be

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:44,250
talking to us about learning by

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,789
tinkering hey I'm unmute so I'm ready to

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,590
go ok he already introduced me as James

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,020
White's was that makes easy I do have to

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,780
go off here and say that I do work at

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,520
IBM but pretty much anything I put in my

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,710
presentation would probably be be

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,420
disavowed pretty quickly by the

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,879
bureaucracy even though most of my peers

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,950
probably like it so this is not official

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,590
IBM so ok that keeps my job secure for

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,090
another week or so and we'll go on to

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,250
this one tinkering and education I found

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,100
a lot of cases it's very entertaining

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,409
for children to actually do things as

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,159
opposed to learn them or see them in a

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,840
book when you when you actually do an

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,150
experiment that changes the color or

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,790
something or build something they can

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,130
use later on it seems to stick in the

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,990
head a lot better not for everybody

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,220
because you know differentiate education

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,740
lots of different things when you're

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,990
playing with this let's go ahead and get

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,939
started here I'm going to turn it into

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,619
an actual presentation and I'm going to

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,390
start with my first one here bow and

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,759
arrow now in most cases it's actually

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,439
not that difficult it is incredibly

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,140
difficult because I might call my tenth

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,149
iteration of the bow and arrow trying to

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,680
make one this one here I actually got it

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,069
would boast calm because they're

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,590
professionals and do it mine are

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,660
actually pretty sad I got to the point

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,750
where i can put like a

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,210
the backup do drywall as I've learned in

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,220
my garage I'm playing with that one but

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,620
if the the I think the key is here is

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,910
why it's just something that's fairly

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,940
entertaining because right now in

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,120
popular culture you can see I was

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,340
walking through a I was walking through

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,620
the sporting goods sections of a local

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,600
store in Charlotte and I'm seeing

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,650
teenage girls standing around looking at

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,510
bows and arrows pretty exciting and I

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,970
blame it all on the hunger games right

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,500
now but I think we got this one that's

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,680
what I'd be the new green arrow by the

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
way so if we looking out there let's

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,820
something fun to play with this we can

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,400
pass around give you guys something to

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,040
play whoo look at on this one I didn't

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,930
bring the arrows because I was at a

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,990
previous conference they followed me

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,580
through the presentation and look a

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,080
little bit nervous when I did that one

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,080
over a paz con but

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,800
ok I'm back for you in here ok don't

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,710
stand on the wire that was that's

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,910
another key lesson here today but I've

00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:23,440
learned as you go into this it's like

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,450
there's a lot of interesting things you

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,180
can dig out on it when you shoot an

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,090
arrow to physics of how it flies the

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,410
woodwork of actually creating the arrow

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,240
the history to come from it that's an

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,190
English longbow obviously you can go

00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,800
back to the battle air and and tie

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,340
things in so it has it has the fun of

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:49,930
actually putting in a of tying in a lot

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:52,989
of history with it too ok this one here

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,390
is actually because I've actually got

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,150
out my daughter started calling monopoly

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,420
monopole so as I get started off as I'm

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,270
having a corrector on the presentation

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,760
but actually I think we started going

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,340
into the conversation to a game and why

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,680
everything was named after a street in

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,780
Atlantic City and you started going some

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,720
of the other things wider railroads they

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,090
are all ones that serve Atlantic City be

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,890
a no Pennsylvania now kind of things so

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,410
actually it's like using a game is

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:26,050
another way of as a teaching tool even

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,560
something as simple as monopolies and

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,880
one interesting thing is when you play

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,979
it always turns out that a high

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,050
percentage of people who win are the

00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,560
first one who gets a set of like one of

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,210
the of one of the boards also you got

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,590
percentages to we get there with like

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,280
Tennessee Avenue and that kind of stuff

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,630
up here in the orange section ok like I

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,000
got to learn up and yet again that I'm

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,030
actually that's ones people land on the

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,070
most but if you end up getting any three

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,900
set and you have like one or two of the

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,850
other ones that one keep anybody else

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,490
from getting a set it's almost like the

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,520
way patents work in a sense you're

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,200
basically you basically deny anybody

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,540
else and then eventually you start

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,210
taking over everything from just owning

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,410
one set so it's actually one of those

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:17,440
interesting ones too I'm next military

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,300
so a navy actually so that's why risk is

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,590
actually it's an entertaining game so I

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,500
played it ever since I was

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,270
kid but as I went in there there's some

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,740
other really interesting things if you

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,680
look at the board in the dynamics and

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,800
how it moves now when you look at world

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,130
politics if you take Brazil North Africa

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,860
South Europe and the Middle East you

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,690
actually dominate for content continents

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,450
keep anybody else I'm able to get them

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:47,770
and yes so it's interesting block but

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,450
then I get to go didn't I always drop

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,880
into the navel conversation how the

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,680
British dominated the world on this one

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,210
from one little dot and really didn't

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,910
have him that they did hit all choke

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,010
points hit Gibraltar hit the Straits of

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,750
Makkah hit South Africa before they

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,310
built the Suez Canal and took the Suez

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,480
Canal when a wouldn't actually build

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:08,770
that and of course this extension of a

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,410
historical extension of us a naval power

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,530
of the United States grabbing Panama and

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,600
other like and other checkpoints and

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,490
actually they be able so risk is

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,740
actually a very poor analogy for how the

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:25,060
world actually works but it's a good

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,110
starting point for conversations and I'm

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,730
sure you can do that with a bunch of

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,800
other games too it's really just

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,660
breaking down and discovering what's um

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,390
what's hitting in some of these things

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,950
and some of the hidden messages

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,260
especially to go to jail and monopoly

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,550
that happens a lot too so so

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,140
unfortunately that happened in real

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,680
world so you get to get into some of

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,330
that political stuff okay Charlotte

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,370
FBI's haven't noticed it's going to get

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,440
the democratic national convention in

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,700
here and of course the first thing I

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,890
thought of is when they were talking

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,090
about the NATO summit in Chicago and the

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,680
people getting arrested for making

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,900
Molotov cocktails was making napalm so

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,170
okay good reference book illustrated

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,040
guide to home chemistry for make we can

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,750
pack that through just as a future

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,660
reference I do not suggest if you're

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,730
like going to occupy or tea party the

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,040
DNC or anything like that making napalm

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,070
and taking it but but that is the first

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,210
thing that really popped to mind so and

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,950
actually it's much better than the

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,640
Molotov cocktail and I just think about

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,250
that it's some of the rules that come

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,070
around with chemistry on this one I was

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,800
working in Texas and I found out I

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,200
in order Urlacher tubes or containers a

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,670
little triangle things because people

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,920
are using them in meth labs so they

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,870
outlawed them or alcohol the ability to

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,240
order them so you have to actually have

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,070
special permission that kind of thing or

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,150
if you go through some other options on

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,800
this one when I made gunpowder well

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,750
that's that just happened to be too weak

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,850
to TSA decided to like use their little

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,250
scrubbing things on my bag so that was

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,420
another that was another interesting why

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,440
you always get to the airport two hours

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,850
ahead of time and take the sharp edge

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,160
off your soldering iron for go through

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,500
the testing too but that's another story

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,330
but I'm but is the interesting thing but

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,490
again it's the legal consequences

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,900
sometimes a deal into this and you go

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,280
you get to bring in it's like you're

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,670
tinkering and playing with chemistry

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,900
sets at home probably a good idea too

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,520
well I won't say I don't inform the

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,080
police on this side and this side but a

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,770
lot of the things you're doing or

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,539
something that could be construed is

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,210
questionable my other people by the way

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,880
if you do make the Napalm don't set it

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:43,530
off on asphalt it does asphalt is

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,780
flammable so I have a nice mark on my

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,480
street in front of my house now keep a

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,550
fire extinguisher nearby but it's

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,410
actually incredibly easy to you all you

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,930
really need is gasoline in a styrofoam

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,570
yes like keep adding styrofoam until

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:02,280
it's all the gasoline is soaked up but

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,170
another story ah this I got yesterday so

00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,150
this is showing what I did last night as

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,600
opposed to like practicing my

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,130
presentation so by the way I grew up and

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,840
was educated in KY early in the state of

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,680
South Carolina so if you have any

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,980
questions about my the since i'm not a

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,690
native English speaker feel free feel

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,750
free to throw question out any time you

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,480
guys want to but this is what I did last

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,600
night and actually tux was there that

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,580
was just serendipity he's I've had that

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,080
thing like for decades and it just had

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,060
to be sitting by my TV that that's about

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,500
as far as I got was a command prompt so

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,690
that's what she that's what you get with

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,670
like red eye and four hours or four

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,770
that before a presentation but if

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:55,080
anybody wants to see one life feel free

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:56,760
to open the box and take a pic now it's

00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,590
a you were asking before about hear it

00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,820
on the Audrina Arduino boards and

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,070
actually I do like to play a lot with

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,850
those there's a few interesting things

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,850
out there most of its brand new and lots

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,290
of things you can play with but this

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,270
thing's would be the hot thing of the

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,770
week so I kind of went ahead and threw

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,770
that out and had to come in place

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,080
another interesting site here I

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,540
introduce my older daughter to Tinkercad

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know if anybody's actually tried

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,330
that before but she actually make your

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,150
3d objects so we're using with a 3d

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,890
printer I probably would have showed you

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,430
guys a 3d printer but right now it's in

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:45,870
parts and in my yard or am I still in

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,610
construction so it's again just

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,050
something neat to play with you get to

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,760
do the three-dimensional thing you get

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,290
to learn from something like this making

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,160
things making objects in three

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:58,110
dimensions and playing with them and and

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,390
it's very easy and by the way my

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,220
daughter is um my older daughter is 10

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,860
my younger ones eight they both can use

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,020
it without much trouble and they make

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,280
interesting things and we haven't got to

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,910
the point where you can actually print

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,280
them out but we're getting close so as

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:18,000
soon as I as soon as I figure out how to

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,290
make the printer work here's one that's

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
interesting and actually you can see i

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,440
modified it cuz i'm better if would work

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,870
that I because my 3d printer doesn't

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,210
work yet so I can't do the little

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,170
plastic thing and print it out but this

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,580
is actually a three-dimensional scanner

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,720
and we can if we get through the

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,450
presentation I went ahead and brought

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,800
the box and we can actually plug that in

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,270
and show it Laser still up anyway so I

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,600
think everything's too far away on that

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:50,130
with the line laser but basically it's

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,980
using a old ps3 camera and line laser

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,579
and if you go to maker scanner and a

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,339
link into how to actually

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,049
do this this was a nice afternoon where

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,749
for work after I got all the parts in

00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:04,179
place I got a found all the parts laying

00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:05,739
around and I'm painters tape from where

00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,079
I was working so I was actually able to

00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:11,259
take this on an airplane so one other

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:16,059
thing and I only got a short delay well

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:23,920
the TSA in Los Angeles entertain me or

00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:26,369
ask questions about it another thing on

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,480
this one has a robot operating system

00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:31,389
there's something else it's very

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,179
entertaining and playing with I didn't

00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,529
drag the NXT around because as I flew in

00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,089
last night I couldn't find it my

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:39,670
daughter let it loose some place in the

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,790
house and probably the battery is ended

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,350
up dying but I know it's there someplace

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:48,279
but a robot operating system actually

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,720
has a nice driver for the NXT but it

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:55,889
also works on multiple more mature

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,299
robots to ones based on Arduino Tsar

00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,759
hopefully one based on a Raspberry Pi in

00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:02,410
your future we'll see how it goes but

00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,379
it's a good starting point and it is

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,119
open source always a good thing to start

00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:14,139
with feel free to ask questions or like

00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:19,779
throw out ideas here because yeah

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:21,730
actually that's the point i was at help

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,879
anybody I any questions anything they

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:30,429
want to talk about go out there go ahead

00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:33,100
yes on that one odd the Debian one is

00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:36,699
the quickest one to download frankly and

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:42,249
I figured that would work so on the

00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:44,769
first shot I'm I'm pro no he asked me

00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,660
which one I started on 2 pi they have

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,999
four distros on there i think as an arch

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:56,610
linux on that one I'm really more of a

00:13:48,999 --> 00:14:03,079
fedora fan for what I do so but hmm yes

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:05,820
it's a very development board yeah yeah

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,370
yeah again it's just one of those things

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,079
where I actually I like the door because

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,930
the plant translates writing to work

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,740
what I do for a living is generally you

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,500
touch red hat or susi in less susi now

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,480
but when you're doing that when it's

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,100
actually a nice translation actually I

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,690
have a hard time remembering the

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,329
different commands and translating it

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,320
then even when you go back to like what

00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:31,890
uh what are those things traditional

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,019
eunuch sees like AIX and you don't see

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:40,130
hp-ux much anymore and solaris is

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:44,640
starting to disappear but yeah so yeah

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:46,920
Oh different things all right any other

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,260
questions or things on there because I

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,670
know I forgot like a million things on

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,680
this one and I think they're like the

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,440
things I've built on thing I could throw

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,360
things out on that one we did do the six

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,670
inch telescope on a reflector which I

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
got to take a picture of him didn't

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,050
bring this time it dropped a paz con and

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,250
that's probably another reason why they

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,470
were following me around and have a

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,720
wagon with like you know telescope lives

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:14,130
five foot long and I was carrying bows

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,320
and arrows and that kind of stuff so so

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,079
I toned it down for this one because I

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,910
have to live here mainly because I still

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,350
live in the county so if they call the

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,360
police I don't want to get on any kind

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:29,839
of list but other projects or other

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,839
things or

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,149
there's a few things he's asking if I

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:43,149
what I've done with Arduino or played

00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:45,519
around other arm based things I have

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:49,690
tried a small working robot from

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,459
freescale but frankly the almost all

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,620
their drivers were built around windows

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,300
so I got to the point where I could get

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,010
everything to move on Windows and then I

00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,050
tried to move it over to linux and the

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,920
drivers have to be rewritten and I

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,839
struggled with that so but again I don't

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,490
blame it i think i think freescale is a

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,399
good product it's just a matter of like

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,860
my lap is skill programming on that side

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,230
and my insistence on not having a

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,820
windows machine in my house so that's

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,630
part of it all about the part of the

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,089
problem there as we go the other way

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,320
with Arduino 'he's there are lots of

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,680
things you can do and it's a remarkable

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,410
air you can get like information from

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,540
Popular Mechanics within the last 3-4

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,029
months actually had a build your first

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,889
robot agree no base one that's a very

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,680
nice one and very simple kit to start

00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,569
with parallax just came out with a

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,730
modification their Board of Education

00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:44,649
they've been doing basic stamp forever

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,920
and I remember building like one of

00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:52,540
their robot arms I got a decade 15 years

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,010
ago we're using their basic stamp now

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,019
they have a board of education which

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,730
plugs on concord we know and you can act

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:01,720
in all their their entire range of

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,880
sensors sparkfun is another great place

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,819
for getting a learning sparkling zircon

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,309
they got like 50 different things you

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,650
can do on this side a time that are very

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,419
well set up and another thing that can

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:17,439
play around so a lots of places you can

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:19,660
get references on this one one thing I'm

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,850
doing Ford we know I'm actually thinking

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,620
of changing jobs and changing locations

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,260
so I haven't quite got all the way on

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,390
this one yet changing jobs with an IBM

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,080
by the way so it's like if they my HR

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:34,960
people are watching salam is actually

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,179
building a greenhouse with water sensors

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,750
there's actually a nice one on that one

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,720
and I'm trying to think of

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,930
DF robotics actually has sells the water

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,580
sensors so this again tons of stuff out

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,520
there and things you can fly with and

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,960
start with on that one and actually when

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,030
we think about the raspberry pi is

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,800
actually a good example one thing I was

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:59,870
thinking about on that is I remember

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,880
growing up as a kid and this is like 30

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,030
years ago I'm 15 years old I got my

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,910
first computer in Atari 800 which I

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:12,680
spent hours typing in programs on out of

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:15,020
magazines and I realized that I was

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,420
thinking today it had 48 km memory I

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,620
remember how excited I was when I got it

00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:24,080
a disk drive it had they could store 140

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,640
k program on it and then using the hole

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,290
puncher so I could flip it over and

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,010
store another hundred 40k on the other

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,100
side and realizing this raspberry pi i

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,500
plugged in an eight gig SD card with the

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,290
program and use gparted of course to

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,860
expand it so it could use the entire

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:45,530
amount off the image they created its

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,370
built-in memory it's ten times more

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,260
powerful and if I remember right that

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,830
Atari 800 cost me about three hundred

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,960
and eighty bucks at the time so this $35

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:01,370
raspberry pi is ten percent of the cost

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,040
and hundreds of times more powerful I

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,600
could you say you can run web servers on

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,160
it fairly easily but that's like the

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,760
first thing that popped into mind is an

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,650
embedded web server but it's more

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,240
empower phul enough to run some of the

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,150
things for some of the basic programming

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,370
languages like MIT scratch on that one I

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,060
think it can wing that I know a

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:26,440
relatively used laptop can so it's like

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm pretty sure you can do that thing

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,810
cool okay so you got it in so you've

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,300
seen the territory you got yours quicker

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,290
or money okay so yeah here by the side

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,200
of thing they're finally starting to

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,060
ship on those things it's uh which ones

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,800
you get it from

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,600
graduate oh it does cool I haven't

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,130
gotten that far yeah just like I was

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,310
getting really tired last night vision

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:53,280
yeah but you got it on that side it's

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,780
all time no that's perfect and just for

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,390
repeating on the question he was saying

00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,510
that scratch was already built on to the

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,820
Debian distro for the Raspberry Pi okay

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,230
I'm babbling but anybody else got

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:11,880
questions or something else who wants

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:13,950
out well i wish i was actually there is

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,720
one in charlotte that some fairly

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,140
aggressive its hide in wealth to

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,610
charlotte lug but unfortunately my

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,270
travel it makes it extremely difficult

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:28,650
i'm actually not in charlotte most of

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,770
the time so everything I do is like

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,180
pretty much I live out of that bag

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,400
whatever I can fit in the bag and take

00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,620
with me or bring home but the important

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,750
thing is it's like when my children get

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:45,650
involved with it afterwards as a lot of

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,180
things that we've done with that it's in

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,030
having a hackerspace it's like real this

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,760
weekend time so yes I probably should be

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:57,000
involved yeah but it's always a timing

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,830
thing but right now I have enough tools

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,060
to keep us busy maybe when they get

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,620
older and we need things that are a

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:07,080
little bit more destructive will

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,160
consider that so okay anything else out

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,920
there but that no it's a great

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,930
opportunity it's like to do that if you

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,990
look at my garage right now as I realize

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,600
it's like my wife piles stuff on top of

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,250
all my stuff so I have to clean before I

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,510
can actually do anything on the weekends

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,560
but that's another story conflict

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,560
another one of those things different

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,500
between 15 and 45 but any other

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,620
questions yes with you having kids that

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,620
are

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,990
hard to find sites for them yes they

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,920
don't know see they don't know job of

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,880
there any sites that you could recommend

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:47,120
that are good for hacker sites based I

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,370
mean makes good DIY or just came out

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,540
yeah why like a learner's spark funcom

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:56,580
has an address a brand new site and that

00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,160
actually has a ton of life simple

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,970
projects that are very easy to do with

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,590
that age group and slightly older we

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,679
actually spent a lot of time in the age

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,750
group with Legos at this point so and

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,460
she's uh she's actually starting to

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,830
robot the older ones starting to robot

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,290
class at the lego store up in north

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,850
charlotte next week so she's already

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:23,190
hopefully had a head start and she'll do

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:25,620
well with that but so there's a lot of

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,330
interesting things out there but it's um

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,549
yeah the younger ager groups are a

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,580
little more difficult right now we spend

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:34,169
a lot of time actually teaching them not

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,710
to put your fingers under the rotating

00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:40,650
haunt us all and that kind of stuff so

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:43,049
or but I mean I let my daughters like

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,910
set off the Gunpowder because frankly I

00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:49,080
make it so poorly that it doesn't

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:50,820
explode it has sparkles so I didn't let

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,740
him touch the napalm so there are

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,049
balances on this one you know teaching

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,500
them some of the basics like wearing eye

00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:00,690
protection wearing gloves keeping a fire

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,540
extinguisher nearby I know little things

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,890
like that is where I'm target on this

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,309
one as the electronics and the

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,530
programming go my younger daughter is

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,650
actually making stop-motion movies with

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:17,640
her Legos now so so we're slowly getting

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:19,710
there so it's but all depends I guess on

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,700
how mature to kid is and how much you

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:24,600
trust them so or actually their kids

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,240
they're going to hurt themselves

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,140
eventually anyway okay I washed out the

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,720
screen any other questions anything else

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,120
doing because I'm sure I'm well ahead on

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,890
time he hasn't shown up he hadn't put up

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,020
my five-minute warning things

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,510
holy crap yeah I always speak too fast

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,740
that's one of those that's that's why

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,230
they don't give me the good speaking

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,360
spots yeah as we can demonstrate the

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:56,510
scanner let's see we can make a wing

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:59,600
here at this thank you see this is what

00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:03,730
a red-eye and not sleeping like not

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,730
sleeping on a regular basis does to you

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:18,530
those NXT Legos they actually have a

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,760
book series like just like the one I've

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,940
been doing at my daughter's all like

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,260
breaking stuff Mayan pyramids they

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,730
actually don't actually it's not an

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,470
instruction booklet these Legos

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,240
challenger here put this block I'm here

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,100
the basically tell you i have a problem

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,170
to solve you got to get this robot into

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:38,290
a small passageway and trip a trigger

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,290
plate then they kind of design

00:24:49,070 --> 00:25:01,380
my daughter's been truly what did you

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,890
searchable we look at the NXT robot look

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,530
for my own okay as I repeating my

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,650
question NXT robot Mayan is a good

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,660
learning resources something if you find

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,720
it out give me the name so we can repeat

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:34,770
that further presentations or the

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:36,540
television person okay well no said it's

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,220
very similar to scratch actually the way

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,110
they put it together with a little bit

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,110
little blocks that you click together

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:51,780
see here the my adventure James blue

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:57,020
Kelly okay the mine adventure by James

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,020
Floyd Kelly whoa

00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:11,400
see oh yeah you see this is how I mess

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,309
up here it's like how many times I have

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,990
to do to upgrade my box because I don't

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,520
know two commands and I'm mixing them up

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,919
of young commands and that kind of stuff

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,230
that here we go this actually kicks off

00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:30,630
whoo there we go and so you got the

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:33,270
camera and if I turn on the laser oh not

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:38,850
know I sorry see that's another thing

00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:43,230
learn to turn around come on computer

00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:45,030
there we go all right and of course I

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:49,169
actually didn't I didn't do any of this

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:51,030
stuff obviously but you see the top

00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:53,429
green line tells you the top at a scan

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,559
middle green line and then we throw on

00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:58,260
the laser and the idea is to get that to

00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:08,370
the point where it's kind of in the

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:10,380
middle and let's see here I want you yes

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:14,610
I actually forget how to do this has

00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:19,590
been a week or two and yes I know that's

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:24,090
scary on that side see get the laser on

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:28,170
there I'm supposed to cover let's see

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:29,910
here okay normally on this one here is

00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,230
you need a nice bat white background to

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:36,480
make it work but we're going to cheat a

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:42,740
little bit anybody got an object mmm

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,740
yeah that's a box it's a square Louisa

00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:54,470
here we go looks like i put this actual

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:54,470
program back up there let's see here

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:03,000
okay start scan here we go we start so i

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:09,720
get friggin upgrade not looking here we

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:13,830
go there we go nice a box there let me

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:19,220
see here turn this off click on start

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:21,809
scan yeah we'll call point cloud again I

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,280
did my shul earlier which you can see

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:27,480
how long it goes like wow that's not

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:36,150
that is a long time ago yeah I'll

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:40,429
replace it cover the laser done Center

00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,429
the laser boom centered

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:51,540
I look like about 25 50 centimeter see

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:53,980
you that's probably a little more okay i

00:28:51,540 --> 00:29:05,640
don't think i have to be perfect on this

00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:05,640
one yeah I do but it will be okay oops

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:15,499
just replace it let's say that girl

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:24,409
there I cover the laser done senator

00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:30,919
laser oh that's right yeah I got a

00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:32,529
little angle here this is what happens

00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:42,159
when you make it with like painters tape

00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:42,159
and other fun things like that yes yes

00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:53,330
oh yeah now I can actually do it this is

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,080
actually a fun part you have to move

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,549
this thing back and forth really slow

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:03,950
look it's not dealing here may be too

00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:05,539
flattered mmm yeah it's there I can see

00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:11,840
the little blue dots but i think i got

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:19,669
to too boring a coverage here okay let's

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:22,749
try it again with an angle yeah see if

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:22,749
we get something like that

00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:33,349
Deborah laser I cheat what my cover

00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:42,349
laser actually turn it off we sent her a

00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:43,789
laser yeah I still centered and I can

00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:48,139
see the little blue dots on I don't know

00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:49,820
if you guys can see it on the screen but

00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:54,409
normally this thing gets covered up with

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:58,309
a nice like blue presentation doohickey

00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:59,659
as we go back and forth the laser yeah

00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:01,999
that's the real problem is I don't have

00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:04,399
the right background I like picking up

00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:06,259
too much other stuff I actually take in

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,739
the scanner this can't reach some of the

00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:14,679
other things that are out there yeah no

00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:14,679
no laughing OH whitesell only works good

00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:23,719
there we go yeah I'm has to now I'm too

00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:29,329
far away why I did this I did it on a

00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:32,739
wall so if you actually deal with the

00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:32,739
actual software here

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,210
I have a nice white wall behind me but

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:47,480
it's again another one of those

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:52,470
interesting things replace covered laser

00:31:47,480 --> 00:32:02,520
and you can throw other questions as you

00:31:52,470 --> 00:32:05,130
want to you on this one I have one and I

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,380
have the book this some and I actually

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,660
have an old are like a four wheeler my

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,520
girls at outgrown that I'm i was going

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,000
to glue it on too I had it working with

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,190
like a webcam before and oh yes if I

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,290
ever tried to connect by the way I had

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,470
it working with a webcam driving around

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:25,890
the backyard using actually this laptop

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:28,080
at one point but it is controller but it

00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,930
kept running into a fence it didn't turn

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,520
soon enough but hopefully the connect

00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:36,000
i'll be able to upgrade that but that's

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:44,100
going to be another project let's get

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:47,970
into frames and turn to laser on I'm

00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:51,540
sorry that's working a little better yes

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,610
there is a some is it's actually and of

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,440
course Microsoft is actually embraced it

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,500
yeah I'm not getting a good luck on this

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,940
one I'm getting a few points as he is

00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,220
you look on there on the screen you can

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,260
see a few small blue dots so they might

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,670
not have the resolution up there but

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,530
normally what ends up happening on this

00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,510
picture is you get a cut you just swing

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:13,880
it back and forth on out and it turns

00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:16,880
blue but you go through just a few the

00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,100
design criteria

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,990
the device is laser have to be so far

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,030
away from the camp it does i'm actually

00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,850
you have a you have a set on how far

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,480
away it is normally to the false 50

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:32,900
centimeters when i did it before the

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,990
camera to be separated like they do for

00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:39,380
the angle so at least according to the

00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:41,360
wiki actually i haven't the physics have

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,300
sold me off a little bit on that but in

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,880
general yes it does it does need to be

00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,220
separated by a small distance and

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,890
actually this is pretty close to what

00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,200
the the printout is just doesn't have

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:58,580
the fancy things on there like a little

00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,380
turning knob and everything else so the

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,470
offset of the angle actually makes it

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,930
possible to to get the three dimensions

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,510
to the laser the lasers which are

00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:11,120
actually focusing on painting the object

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:17,300
with there's actually another one it

00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:19,909
came out here yes hmm Oh as a line laser

00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,560
it's like three bucks on amazon or you

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,330
can get it from buy com a bunch of other

00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,240
place they ask me where I got the laser

00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:30,950
from so yeah it's just called a line

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,470
laser line laser red 3 ohms the cameras

00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:35,600
far more expensive but frankly you can

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:38,510
pick them up for like 20 bucks on as

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,879
refurbs connects are also very good at

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,730
that too from in the ass early you can i

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,899
picked up a connect for this little over

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,100
sixty dollars there's a refurb device

00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,899
and you just look around on the website

00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,159
do you find them especially these things

00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,580
you're going to like throw around and

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,870
take apart and play with actually that's

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,890
why i was looking forward to like sure i

00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:03,560
got my Oh Kendall that's what they call

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,930
them I got a kindle in but the truth

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,880
when you look at the Kindle when you

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,740
start taking it apart by parts that

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,510
little screen is like 80 bucks and you

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,940
can get like a refurbished kindle I had

00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,230
a special deal in conf like 50 and then

00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,880
there's like a whole you got the inside

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,260
computer in there which I think would be

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,270
a little harder to work with but a

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,460
battery and a power supply it's already

00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,620
hooked up for that too so scavenging

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,210
parts is actually one of the funner

00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,040
things that you can do this

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,910
I'm scared just about a hundred and

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:35,180
fifty stepper motors from old copiers

00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,550
yeah copies are really really yeah laser

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,470
printers to in the same idea there's

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,530
someone that one and when you start

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,730
dealing them he was talking about scum

00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,910
getting old stepper motors out of

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,560
copiers and anything is yeah when you

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,560
really break it down as almost all these

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,940
like electronic devices a stepper motor

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,300
Heather you have two wires sometimes

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,940
three no I'm getting mixed up on out in

00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,260
the Apalachee brush motor sorry I'm

00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,070
going on that one I'd say that's the

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:09,740
thing I don't actually know the

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:12,500
terminology I'm just winging it okay

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,990
cool yeah there's always something to

00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,089
take apart that's one of the keys on

00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:20,900
that one had some taking apart as almost

00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:23,060
as fun as putting together so okay well

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,320
I'm failing on this one generally I had

00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,830
it the only time I've done this before

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,240
the big white wall behind it so for the

00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,390
camera is there anything specific for

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,700
just any webcam I haven't tried it with

00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:39,680
any webcam other than these Sony's the

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:42,530
Sony's seem to have a very good yeah I

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,050
say they focus very well they they seem

00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:48,140
to have a better range of range and

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,369
other webcams I was going to try of

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:53,089
another one but again that's one of

00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:54,589
those timing things and and I got like

00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:56,720
three of those laying around the house

00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:59,960
people like people dump these things all

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,670
the time so for some reason doesn't seem

00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,119
to be nearly as popular as it used to be

00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,890
so or ever was was it ever popular I

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,540
don't know the ps3 with the connect with

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,970
a little glowing ball okay it's one of

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:18,470
those things any other questions

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:21,530
somewhere else we can throw out give you

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,450
guys some time back alright well I

00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,670
appreciate it if again if anybody wants

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,520
to come up and play I'm more than happy

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,270
to hang out for a while but thanks for

00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,330
your time

00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,330
you

00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:46,140
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,090
ago we could not have imagined that

00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,310
asterisk would not only become the most

00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,440
widely adopted open source communication

00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,480
software on the planet but that it would

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,000
impact the entire industry in the way

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,980
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,619
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,570
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,670
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,080
transition of power from the hands of

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,330
the traditional proprietary phone

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,730
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,680
administrators of phone systems using

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,910
this power our customers have created

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,859
all sorts of business changing

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,690
applications from small office phone

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:21,210
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,830
the international carrier networks in

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,600
fact there's even an entire country

00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,210
those communications infrastructure runs

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,130
on esters the gym has always been about

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,840
creating technology that expands

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,000
communications capabilities in ways that

00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,380
we could never have imagined and that's

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,020
part of what's game-changing about the

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,480
gym today we're doing it again this time

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,580
by introducing a new family of HD IP

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,859
phones that extends control of the user

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,630
all the way to the desktop the launch of

00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:47,150
these new products represents the next

00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,800
phase indigenous history of innovation

00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,750
these are the first and only IP phones

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,340
designed to fully leverage the power of

00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,960
estrus when we first discussed our

00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,760
expectations for building a family of

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,920
phones for use with asterisk our

00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,660
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,280
the team to build the phones such that

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,500
they were easy to install integrate

00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,330
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,910
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,530
that goal user feedback is validating

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,660
that when it comes to operation with

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:15,060
astro space systems including our own

00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,640
Switchvox based product these are the

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,960
easiest to use best integrated most

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,540
interoperable products on the market

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,540
today the digitally phones will

00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,590
initially include three IP des hommes

00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,540
uniquely designed to complement any

00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,400
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,070
these phones are different for a number

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,740
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:36,150
designed for use with esters secondly

00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,590
we've made it really easy to

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,170
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:42,240
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,190
to access information inside of asterisk

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,790
allowing tight coupling between an

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,750
application and the

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,940
additionally we've created an

00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,040
applications engine that allows users

00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,280
and developers to create and run their

00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,050
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,000
done all of this at a very compelling

00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,680
price point at Digium we're always

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,780
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,360
the best value in business phone systems

00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,890
and also give them the power to create

00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,050
their own solutions or any

00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,790
communications challenge will continue

00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,200
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,270
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,010
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,560
asterisk and communications even easier

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,760
and together we'll change the way the

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,760
world communication again

00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:39,290
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:41,450
way to better utilize all your resources

00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:44,900
and it makes managing all your resources

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:48,730
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:52,220
happening in open source the

00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:54,050
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,150
of the community and the speed at which

00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:58,160
these are these you know these these

00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,470
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,080
discovered and then fixed is that like

00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:05,780
that really shows the power of the you

00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,400
know of the open source community it is

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,600
global and it's definitely because of

00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:17,930
the users community people are extremely

00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:19,670
friendly and almost ready to help if you

00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,130
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,240
these guys helping each other out and

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:26,150
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,980
manner the product is transparent for

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,000
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:34,220
base everyone can see how close that is

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,070
is being built nothing nothing is

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:42,710
proprietary everything is open in many

00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:46,910
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:50,690
unborn helped I'll stack the most

00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:54,440
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:57,440
was our first developer boot camp and

00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,860
our call gay people I give me two weeks

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,030
notice to come attend I was expecting 25

00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:09,200
or 30 people so we ended up with 87

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:11,510
people and had to go get board chairs in

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,390
the room twice everything within cloud

00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,880
computing is commodity and is open

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,700
source and so I don't think that you

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,470
will you'll see anywhere where open

00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,500
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:27,200
computing and so i think it's i think

00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,550
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,290
about cloud computing you're really

00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,290
talking about a source cloud computing

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,630
cloud zac is a robust solution for large

00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,000
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:44,960
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,290
data center is these hardware is going

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,530
to fail and cloudstack is designed to

00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:53,990
handle number one that mass scale number

00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:56,720
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,970
that inevitably happens in large

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,810
deployments we started working on

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:06,140
contact over four years ago and it was

00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:08,810
the original set of people working on it

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,920
had a background of delivering software

00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:17,180
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:20,780
lots of users actually using it high

00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:23,870
availability is a key feature multiple

00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,880
hypervisors support different network

00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,550
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,830
you better while step management server

00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:34,520
can be deployed in different physical

00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:36,170
machines it definitely has a huge

00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:41,150
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:43,730
there's a major movie studio that they

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:47,030
were using CloudStack they were using it

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:49,010
to transcode video and i thought that

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,660
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,930
more fascinating is what they did during

00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:56,720
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,900
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,790
lunch was over they would

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,840
helping instances and go back to doing

00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:05,460
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,560
so many different aspects and there's no

00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,930
one person that's kind of like a master

00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:14,040
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:16,260
as a project is going to be one of the

00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:20,310
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:25,740
most feature fallen and and robust

00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:28,670
platforms out they were I don't see your

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,670
