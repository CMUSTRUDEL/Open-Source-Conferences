the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,029
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,560
possible if you're not running KDE then

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,000
that would be a big install so cute

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,040
tractor doesn't require a whole bunch of

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,489
KDE stuff but it does run on the same

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,000
technology that KDE does a couple of

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,840
different things well actually whoo-hoo

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:56,660
in here right now edits audio on a

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:56,660
semi-regular basis is it discolored yeah

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,940
so no one really edits in here is that

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,189
what I'm getting or is everyone just

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:14,250
refusing okay um I don't know that's a

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:16,369
hard question okay that's annually yeah

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,369
totally what do you what do you use

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,369
annually

00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:29,020
okay yeah what about you what do you use

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,009
yeah yeah sure depends on what Flags you

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:48,770
use dan what do you use you sound really

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:50,600
excited about that okay well I mean

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,250
audacity is a great audio editor and if

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,469
that's what your your frame of reference

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,640
is it's completely different because

00:01:54,469 --> 00:02:01,929
audacity edits the actual audio files

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,829
the audio clips it's a waveform editor

00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:09,019
whereas Q tractor you'll find there

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,090
there are tracks in huge factor much

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:14,450
like one of those fancy mixing boards

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,190
that you see at in studios audio studios

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,319
things like that where they've got those

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,610
little sliders and they're turning the

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,099
singer down while they're turning the

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,110
drummer up or whatever so it's it's a

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,790
different style of working and whether

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,660
that's appropriate for whatever you're

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,060
doing depends largely on on what kind of

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,709
functionality you need most of the cool

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,769
things that you can do in q tractor for

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:41,510
strictly audio editing you can fake in

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:43,010
audacity but there are a lot of cool

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,019
things that you can do in q tractor that

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,180
you couldn't do in a waveform based

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,850
editor like audacity so they both have

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,040
their strengths but sometimes you might

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,280
feel that you need to upgrade from just

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,780
the straight audacity projects so at the

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,620
point when you're finding that you're

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,590
creating like 24 tracks in audacity and

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,109
overlaying in effect you know so that

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,000
you can have reverb last longer than the

00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,290
actual audio clip things like that if

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,480
you're finding that you're doing that

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,660
then it might be time to look at

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,000
something that's track based so I'll get

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,209
into that right now I guess first of all

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,620
in order to run queue tractor you you

00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:29,209
need q tractor but before that you need

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,549
q jack or jack really so jack is a

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,860
command-line application and a daemon

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:36,200
that kind of runs and sort of manages

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,719
all the different sound coming in and

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,209
out of your computer

00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:42,739
and it does that very specifically it

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,530
was very specifically designed as I

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,969
understand it for audio editing so if

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,209
you can think of it like if you've ever

00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:52,310
had like a you know I guess like a USB

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,900
hub or even a networking switch where

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,139
you can plug in lots of different things

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,519
and then kind of tell them all of those

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,310
things that you've plugged in to go to

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:06,530
to another place that's kind of what Q

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:08,780
jack is so people can I mean you can use

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,719
jack on the command line but people

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,609
typically just use it in its gooey form

00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,340
which looks a little bit something like

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:19,970
that it's called Q Jack CTL q Jack

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,190
control and it's a pretty pretty simple

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,440
application if you let it be simple you

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:28,460
can get into the nitty-gritty and really

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,240
make it very complex I find that as

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,849
someone just generating audio for fun

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,770
and even for like multimedia productions

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:39,590
like films and stuff like that that I

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:45,080
work on keeping it simple actually works

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:49,159
really well for me so around the time of

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,050
the Linux kernel to dot 638 dot 4 I

00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:55,940
think because i remember it was right

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:59,509
before it was right after slackware 1337

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,159
came out so that had to dot 637 in it so

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:02,780
around the time like right after that

00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:05,180
there was this big patch was like I

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,810
guess a 200 line code patch to the

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,430
kernel that they made and it suddenly

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,650
resolved like all of these audio latency

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,620
problems so what people were finding

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:18,349
before this to dot 638 dot for Colonel

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,180
was that if they were trying to generate

00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:22,639
that they were asking their computer to

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,289
generate sound effects like reverb and

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,909
stuff like that they would they would

00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,710
experience all this weird like skipping

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:30,919
and stuttering in the sound and it

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:35,180
wouldn't sound very good so after they

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,099
made this big patch in to dot 638 most

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,020
of those problems actually went away so

00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,520
if you read online Oh in order to do

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,430
audio on Linux you have to have a low

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,650
latency kernel or a realtime kernel that

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,270
that may or may not be true I find for

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,210
myself that that's actually no longer

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:54,169
true as long as I have any colonel

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:58,100
all above to dot 6 i'm sure you can see

00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:00,740
that 22 dot 638 dot 4 i'm running 3 dot

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,210
3 dot 4 then it just works everything

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,300
just kind of like it just it just

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,190
generates audio for me so that's a good

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,169
thing that means that if you if you're

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,569
seeing online all over the place all you

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,370
need to look out for this and that you

00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,490
probably don't if you just do if you

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,470
look at your kernel you name space dash

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,000
AV on the command line it'll tell you

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,449
what your running and if you're running

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,840
anything after 2 dot 6038 dot 4 then

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:34,580
you're probably ok to just start making

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:36,560
audio yes they do kernel.org i don't

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,690
remember the exact path but if you look

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,060
around on Colonel org the patches are

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,370
there and I mean if you're if you're

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,900
doing like hardcore like multitrack

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,509
recording like where you're actually

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,919
recording your drummer and your guitar

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,870
player and your singer all at the same

00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,610
time on different buses going into your

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,139
computer and maybe you're applying

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,090
effects while that's all happening

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,340
you're probably going to need some of

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,199
that but i think you'll see just from

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,400
what we do today that that really

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,990
worrying about that isn't something that

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,509
you're going to have to even think about

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,750
anymore so that's out of the way

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,250
automatically to start Jack sort of

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,570
running in the background you simply

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:17,240
launch q jack control q jack CTL it pops

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:20,630
up this little window and you press the

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:25,449
start button and this is what you should

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:28,449
see is just you know that it has started

00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,449
yeah

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:44,870
depends on the yes oh nice what was the

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,140
question oh yeah pulse do you need to

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,140
shut down the the listener asked do you

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:55,790
need to shut down other services on your

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:58,520
computer like especially pulse up until

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,170
very very recently I think most people

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:05,600
found that it was better to shut down

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:08,660
pulse as of I think wind was fedora 17

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,930
released like six days ago or something

00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,350
up I know for sure that they have got

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,840
the bridged pulse and Jack thing

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:26,150
fine-tuned and actually working so now

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:29,980
you don't really have to do that no it

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,060
actually talks pulse and Jack talk now I

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,260
mean I haven't looked at the code and if

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,020
I did it would all look like gibberish

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,610
to me but as I understand that is what's

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,219
going on is it so it's called the ball

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,240
of the pulse Jack bridge so they're

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,640
they're actually talking to each other I

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,560
I think it would again depend on what

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,350
you're what you're going to actually be

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,960
doing like if you are doing multitrack

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,240
recording in a live situation you might

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,250
find that you know really fine-tuning it

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,830
where you do shut down other services

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,030
might be better for you or just making

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,320
sure that you've got a very very

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,320
powerful computer you know I mean

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:30,500
yeah yeah I think previous what he's

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,029
experiencing is that he would try to

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
launch something that was then trying to

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,570
invoke pulse and then our door would

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,790
would complain that that that in order

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,760
to start pulse he'd have to shut down

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,800
jack or you know whatever so I think

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,839
that's been pretty much solved at this

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,589
point but very very recently from what I

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,060
understand the previous previous to like

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,709
a couple of days ago or a week ago I

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,870
think most people were actually for

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,700
their audio systems they were using a

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,130
distribution that either made it really

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,110
easy to uninstall pulse or they were

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,000
using a distribution without pulse

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,579
slackware doesn't have pulse that's what

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,350
I run on so I'd never really had to

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:17,779
worry about that is that the yeah i know

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,839
the command you're talking yeah PA

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:22,100
suspend will actually suspend pulse but

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,240
i don't know what i mean like you say if

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,699
you had need to look up something online

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,620
will that then try to launch pulse and

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:34,370
stuff like that so okay and then it's

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:40,550
off okay so suspend pulse PA suspend try

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:43,100
it out so yeah that that's pulse vs jack

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,560
it's getting a lot better that's i guess

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,140
the bottom line there one thing you

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,910
might have to worry about and you might

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,550
not you might never ever see this but

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,360
one thing that the the computer will

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,339
want you to do is to allow Jack and

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,019
again jack is like this background layer

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,820
that's kind of running in the background

00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,040
you're never going to really interact

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,250
with it but it's just kind of humming

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,920
down there in the background in order

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,260
for it to do real-time or near real-time

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,720
events your computer wants it to have

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,589
special permissions to actually perform

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,880
those that's managed two different ways

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,960
on depending on whatever system you're

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,780
using

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:35,180
on most i believe it's managed with pam

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:41,990
p am it is not managed on Pamela and

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:45,080
slackware um but there is a I mean it's

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:49,460
it's basically the same idea yeah that's

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:54,980
it so you might have to go into a config

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:58,940
file and give it permission to launch

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,680
certain applications with with a greater

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,150
priority so that the colonel doesn't

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,730
constantly try to interrupt those

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,860
processes I'm not a programmer I don't

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,840
know what I just said but all I do know

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,580
is that there's like a text file on your

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,920
computer somewhere that you might have

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,160
to list all the audio applications that

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,470
you want to launch with with better

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,690
permission then what like it would

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,910
normally be able to run at so in this

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,130
case this is set our limits which is

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,630
fairly slackware specific so you might

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,520
not see this unless you're running

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,070
slackware but there is there's something

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,040
very very similar to this for your Pam

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,650
dot limits or security limits something

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,260
like that it's in / etsy and if you put

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,540
in the group the audio group is usually

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,070
what it's called and you're a member of

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,750
the audio group probably unless you

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,430
explicitly removed yourself from that

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,500
group you're probably a member of that

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,970
group and then you give it the name of

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,090
the application that you want to be able

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,610
to run with those higher permissions or

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,470
priorities rather and you give it a nice

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,170
level of negative one so it's not very

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,680
nice a greater real-time priority and

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,820
some thing about memory and locking it

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,430
and stuff like that which I don't really

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,250
know I just copy it from from online so

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,290
that kind of thing so I put it on Jack D

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,270
I put it for Q Jack control i put it for

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,600
q tractor and if there was anything else

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:21,470
that needed better permission to run I

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,140
would I could add it there but that's

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,450
just like to make sure that jack doesn't

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,340
complain when you start it up that it's

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,020
trying to run and run and run and run

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,820
and your kernels like what is this

00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,950
process I need to do other stuff right

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,840
now you want to tell their computer no

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,620
don't I want you to just respect Jack

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,220
and let it do whatever it needs to

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:44,190
any questions about that so it's set our

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,950
limits if you're on slackware pam p am

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,390
that already exists on your computer you

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,220
just need to kind of look into where the

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,500
config file is that you need to change

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,029
to add that program and it quite

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,730
possibly if you're using a fancy

00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,380
distribution that's kind of geared

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,300
toward audio production they might have

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,860
done that for you already like quite

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,960
likely they they have that in their

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,060
install script or whatever so you might

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,620
not even actually have to do it but if

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,450
you go to q jack control and you launch

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,100
it and it starts complaining or it

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,350
doesn't start or it can't start or

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:21,990
something like that that's one thing to

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:29,760
double-check so now I'm going to launch

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:31,980
Q tractor and this is Q tractor there's

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,870
two different kinds of sounds that you

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,000
might want to play around with well

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,740
actually three kinds of sound that you

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,460
might want to play around with NQ

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:44,370
tractor one is like pre-recorded loops

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,000
you know like a drum beat that someone

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:50,160
has created and then has released to the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,709
public for you to use maybe royalty free

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,200
or whatever a great source of that stuff

00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:59,400
would be like freesound.org they're a

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,570
great site for well for all kinds of

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,400
things actually they have they have

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,740
sound effects and all that but they also

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,510
have loops like drum loops guitar loops

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,970
just all kinds of loops so freesound.org

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,350
is really good and that's all really

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,959
nice because it's all Creative Commons

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,339
so you know that if you use that and you

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,560
want to keep your own project Creative

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,779
Commons then that's that will all be

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,180
sort of compatible there's other sources

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,670
too though I mean there's there are CD

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,310
sets for sale of just loops you know

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,110
they're just like hundreds and hundreds

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,760
of loops for all the different kinds of

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,029
musical styles you could ever want if

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,550
you go to any given magazine store it's

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,589
a bookstore it's what existed before

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,600
ebooks came around there they still

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,640
exist in some places if you go there you

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,470
can find these paper versions of e-books

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,480
and look in the back and there's like

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,590
CDs full of loops and stuff like that

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,840
there's also

00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,910
sometimes like I know that I think it's

00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,340
computer music or keyboard one of those

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,260
two they actually at least up until I

00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,700
mean I haven't checked lately but I mean

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,700
for a very long time they were shipping

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,950
with a bundled CD with their magazine

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,470
that would just have a bunch of loops I

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,670
mean it was kind of a you just get what

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,980
you take because you know you're just

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,510
buying the magazine but whatever you're

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,920
looking for you can probably find it

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,300
there's there's loops out there that you

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,280
can use that you're allowed to use

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,890
they're probably either royalty free or

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Creative Commons so that's like

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:24,340
pre-recorded audio that stuff is really

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,940
easy to get into q tractor you see over

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,880
here kind of do this trick no I don't

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,730
have that turned on you see on the the

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,950
right-hand side of the screen this big

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,170
blank window this is the files window

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:42,640
this will keep track of any files that

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,380
you have turned or associated i guess i

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,930
should say with your project right now

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,240
projects empty and actually i like to

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,830
save my project first and foremost even

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,630
though it is empty i just like to kind

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:55,770
of give it a home so that's pretty

00:16:52,630 --> 00:17:01,080
standard we'll just call it self 2012

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,080
and we'll save it in my music folder

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,900
ok so now now this project exists i kind

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,020
of like to do that just to to

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,240
instantiate its home on my drive so now

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,799
i'm going to import some files so if i

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,600
just right click on this panel on the

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,049
right and add files i can go through my

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,470
hard drive which conveniently has

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,200
pre-built loops that i was using anyway

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,799
so i'll just import a couple of them I

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,360
don't know what they're going to sound

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,590
like I don't really remember what these

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,090
are but we'll find out together okay so

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,880
they're just dumped over here on the

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,309
right so this is kind of like my music

00:17:46,880 --> 00:18:01,820
library now so I could just grab this

00:17:49,309 --> 00:18:03,470
loop drop it in it's like so drivi yeah

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,160
so you can just kind of dig through

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:12,169
loops and construct a song like that I

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,650
was a lot more than I minted pool in

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,650
actually

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,360
yeah alright so maybe you can construct

00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:49,400
loops obviously from this and if you

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,140
loop things that sound similar enough

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,120
together and a lot of times the loop

00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,440
sets that you'll get our specially

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,809
designed I mean they're designed because

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,799
they know that you're going to that

00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,929
you're probably going to loop them

00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:04,250
around and try to construct a song so if

00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:06,740
you do that then you can possibly create

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,970
a new song from pre-built loops that's

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,470
the same loop i think that i keep

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:33,799
playing trying to find one that's

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:36,049
similar yeah let's do that so you keep

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:40,820
looping that around enough and after a

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:43,130
while you get a song so that's kind of

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,659
like the loop based process I mean

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,940
you'll hear a lot of people talking

00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:49,429
about that you know with like programs

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,140
like well GarageBand certainly which is

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,289
I mean that's kind of like their big

00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,610
thing you pull some audio files that

00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:56,960
they give you and you put them in

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,500
different order and suddenly you have a

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,880
song but I mean it works like if your

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,919
goal is to just mess around with some

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,690
sound and make a groovy little song that

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,549
you want to play for your friends then

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,620
that kind of thing works and if you dig

00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:11,090
through your audio enough audio loops

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,940
and put them together you'll you'll end

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,320
up with something interesting and there

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,460
are worse ways to kill some time so I

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,840
mean that's just something that you can

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,000
do looping the actual files you can just

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,429
do like if we like this loop as our

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,779
first loop you can just simply do you

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:32,029
know a normal copy and then paste and

00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:34,399
you'll see that it asks me where exactly

00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:37,270
I want to paste it or i can paste repeat

00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:40,549
meaning that i know i want to loop this

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,640
particular clip like eight times because

00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,049
i can't get enough of this drum beat

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,460
then i could do that but i'm not going

00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:50,510
to do that to us i'm just going to paste

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:54,370
it once and then we've got you know that

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,370
loop and then we cut to a different loop

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,520
that's probably enough to play around

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,120
with so we'll just keep it at that so

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,010
pre-built loops those are really easy in

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,900
terms of getting audio in from an

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,510
external source like if you play guitar

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,280
or you play some instrument or you're

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,720
going to sing along with these pre-built

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,960
loops or whatever you're going to do

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,740
that's getting sound in de q tractor

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,500
from some external source this requires

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,700
a little bit of patch bay work because Q

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,860
tractor I mean depending on your

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,330
computer q tractor doesn't necessarily

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,690
know where you want the sound to come

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,590
from like if you just hit record well we

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,880
can't right now because we don't have a

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,710
track for it but if we were to hit

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,180
record when we were ready for that it

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,890
wouldn't know where to look we have to

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,100
tell it hey I want you to be taking

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:44,080
sound from my fancy external mic or I

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,170
don't have a fancy external mic so just

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,610
grab sound from my built-in laptop mic

00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,080
which probably wouldn't be the best

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,820
sound quality but I mean if that's what

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,330
you've got that's what you've got so to

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,780
define those sorts of things technically

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:03,930
it's done in q Jack control which was

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,930
was that that guy right there the small

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,000
the small little guy running in the

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,370
background that we get to ignore I don't

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,990
generally go out to q Jack control to do

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,400
this because that's the nice one of the

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,830
nice things about Q tractors that the

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,450
same programmer writes both programs q

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,640
tractor and Q jack control so you can

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:27,370
actually do everything from within here

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:30,970
so if we go to view windows connections

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:33,010
I have it short keyboard shortcut to see

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,880
that's not the default but it's a pretty

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:40,090
handy one then you get a list of all the

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,360
possible audio devices that you may or

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:49,600
may not have plugged into your computer

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:54,070
so you've got on one side you've got

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,560
your master out of Q tractor and it's

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,450
going to the playback of your of your

00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,950
computer which is why when I hit play in

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,490
Q tractor we're actually hearing it

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,290
through the speakers these little lines

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,210
these little noodley lines between the

00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:09,309
two windows you can imagine those

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,020
as patch cables as audio cables and

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:14,409
you're plugging it in from your

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,730
synthesizer or your your I don't know CD

00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:17,260
player or whatever you might have

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,980
plugged into a speaker that's that's

00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:24,880
what you're doing here the capture

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,470
device of my system is right now really

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,789
really simple there's only one capture

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,940
device on my system and that's the

00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:35,289
inbuilt mic so this is really easy on a

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:37,090
on my desktop at work I've got like 80

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,070
different input devices I've got like

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,299
this sound card that has so many input

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,830
devices that I don't know what to do

00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,750
with half of them and then some of them

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,120
are kind of fake outs because they're

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,740
actually inputs I guess for my graphics

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,409
card or something which I know I don't

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:54,549
use that way so I'm not really sure what

00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:56,679
all of them are what what I do is I just

00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,809
kind of play around with the with the

00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,909
settings until I find until I can kind

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,980
of identify for myself which capture

00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:05,950
devices what is what actual physical

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,830
hardware device that I can actually see

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,120
on my computer if you know your system

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,130
really well you might already know that

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,600
stuff I tend to get confused about it

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,029
obviously in this case it's really

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,360
simple and it is set by default to go

00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:25,539
from from the from the microphone in my

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,250
laptop over to the input of Q tractor

00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,260
i'm not going to i'm not going to

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,520
actually record because i'm i'm pretty

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,149
sure with all these different

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,919
microphones and speakers I'm we would

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:38,169
get a lot of feedback but i'll show you

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,750
how to how to go right up to the very

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,330
last moment before we set right before

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,120
we hit record so you need to before you

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,159
can bring in new audio that doesn't

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,740
exist yet you need to create a

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,169
destination for it and that is simply a

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,659
track so you go up to the track menu and

00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:57,399
you say add track and it asks you for

00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:01,570
certain details about it it's usually

00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:04,090
good practice to define what the in what

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,549
that track is going to contain if this

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,880
was going to be the vocals then that's

00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:13,419
what i would put in that it's uncle's or

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,190
vocals it's an audio input right we're

00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,659
not doing midi yet because we haven't

00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,750
talked about midi yet so we're doing

00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:23,630
audio

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:25,610
the input is is the master input of Q

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:29,920
tractor and remember that that's mapped

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:32,450
to the capture device of my microphone

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,700
so i should really just be able to say

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:38,990
okay there so now I've got a vocal tract

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,360
it's empty it has nothing there these

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:44,510
little buttons on the side of the of the

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,980
tracks are ms does anyone have any idea

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:57,650
what that and stand for no actually it

00:25:48,980 --> 00:26:01,250
doesn't something else what yeah record

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,830
Odin did it just say that I was hoping

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,050
someone was going to guess Richard

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:08,120
Stallman yeah but no one but Ruby and

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,880
square was pretty good too yeah so this

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,800
is record mute and solo so if we wanted

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,440
to record then we would just hit our

00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,720
that arms the track for recording it's

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,400
not actually recording yet so what you

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,200
would have to do at that point is you

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,460
would hit record and I'm not going to do

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,310
that because I don't want the feedback

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,660
it would hurt so we would hit record and

00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,000
then you would hit play to start the

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,860
transport recording so it's very much

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,790
like an old tape cassette system where

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,860
you would you'd hit you'd hit record and

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,290
play I think right is that correct yeah

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,150
you hit record and play and that that's

00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,730
saying okay I want you to write to this

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,710
tape as well as advanced the tape that's

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,050
what's happening here you hit record and

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,270
then play and it would start recording

00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,670
from the default input which is that

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,710
microphone on my laptop which i'm not

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,350
going to do right now but will record

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,690
midi instead so i don't know i mean any

00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,520
questions on that it's pretty simple

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,500
once you see it I mean if you've got a

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,390
USB mic it's the same thing right it'll

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,910
just show up in your connections window

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,890
and instead of instead of just being

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,350
called capture underscore one capture

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,150
underscore to it might look like I don't

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,070
know the brand name of your USB

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:19,970
microphone so if you have like a blue

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:22,670
mic or that's the only one I can think

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:25,580
of right now but a blue mic that's USB

00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:28,340
it would pop up as a new as a new input

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,570
and you could select that and send it to

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,580
the master input of Q tractor

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:36,389
and maybe disconnect the one from the

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,590
internal microphone which is more often

00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,120
than not what you would want to do you'd

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,429
probably be recording from your external

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,860
mic not not from the internal mic of

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:48,809
your of your laptop unless your laptop

00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:50,940
microphones really good okay so the

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:53,100
other kind of audio and this is kind of

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,850
what sets Hugh tractor right now apart

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,730
from certainly our door well certainly

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:04,590
certainly audacity rather and and still

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:08,100
our door our door 3 is starting to

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:11,220
integrate some MIDI functionality but

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,559
right it's it's not it's it's not there

00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,570
yet I mean they're working on it and it

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,940
will be soon so if you're just in love

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,340
with gtk you can you can do that you'll

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,500
have just as good just as much luck with

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:27,659
it as you would this I imagine but it's

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:30,029
just not there yet so MIDI is a protocol

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:33,029
actually that they invented I don't know

00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:35,429
like probably back in the 80s where they

00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:37,440
started doing like digital synthesizers

00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:39,509
and they realized that it was really

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,759
complex for a musician for a keyboardist

00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:43,440
to be pressing all these keys on like

00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,759
eight different synthesizers and they

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,419
figured out that if they sent really

00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,789
simple in little pulses to each keyboard

00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:53,070
they had 128 channels they could send

00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,500
all kinds of music tracks to each

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,360
synthesizer and have them start playing

00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,759
in unison and you could then record them

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,710
and you'd have like this this you know

00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,960
symphony of different synthesizers

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,389
playing in rhythm all at the same time

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,889
without you actually having to

00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:09,570
simultaneously play everything so it was

00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:12,179
a big deal and it turns out that it's

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,909
that it was written really well enough

00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,820
so that it survived all the way until

00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:19,860
now and has even kind of crossed over to

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,899
being something that you can do

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,149
internally inside of the computer you

00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:25,649
don't even have to really have

00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:27,779
synthesizers all over the place right so

00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:29,610
back in the 80s you'd literally have

00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,019
like a big synthesizer and you might

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,149
have it plugged into some kind of MIDI

00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,590
interface and then you'd have that midi

00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:35,960
interface plug into your computer and

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,460
you'd be programming all these little

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,500
dots and lines and stuff that you want

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,149
to trigger certain notes to be playing

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,130
you'd send that to the interface you'd

00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:43,910
sin that the

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,190
interface would send that to the

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,100
keyboard you don't really have to do

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,220
that on the on today you can but you

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,750
don't have to but it's good to kind of

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,820
keep that in mind because that's kind of

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,650
the model that we're still using so

00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,780
again to create a new track we would go

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,160
to track and add a track but this time

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,680
and we'll call it something I guess

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,450
we'll call it synth one and this time

00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:12,500
we'll say that it's it's a MIDI track

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:14,810
it's not an audio track we don't have

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,880
any instruments loaded for this yet we

00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,590
don't have a synth yet right we've got

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,360
the computer but we don't have our

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,060
imaginary synthesizer that we're going

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:27,790
to play so to get that we switch over to

00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:31,910
this tab on the right called plugins and

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:34,760
we can add a new plugin and there's a

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:37,660
bunch of different soft sense like

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,370
software-based since available for Linux

00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,600
they're pretty much all free but I'm

00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,880
sure you can find some that aren't if

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,350
you tried but I mean so some really

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,750
really good ones are out there that you

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,450
can just install straight off of

00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:54,830
whatever repository or website you want

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,960
to grab them from there's a calf plugin

00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,700
called mono since there's fluid synth

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,710
which uses something really cool called

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,840
soundfonts which are like little tiny

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,850
miniature bite-sized samples so they're

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,150
really really small file sizes that

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,340
sound like you know huge like stuff that

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,620
people sample like very carefully and

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,810
and they sound like real instruments

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:18,140
essentially being played but they're a

00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,810
lot smaller than a big sample bank and

00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,550
you've got two of my favorites ry synth

00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,140
and X synth they're actually really

00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,490
really I think one is a fork of the

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,980
other or something so they're really

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,970
similar we'll just go with X synth right

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,740
now so if I select that one it kind of

00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,210
tells me what different patches I have

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,190
loaded into it I don't really need to

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,680
pay attention to that right now but

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:42,410
that's so now on my MIDI track I have

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:45,940
basically plugged my computer into an

00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:49,580
imaginary invisible synth called X synth

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,080
and so it's kind of ready to go so we'll

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,620
go back over here now we can kind of

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,879
tell q tractor what we want to use so we

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,829
can go down to

00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:59,479
what instrument i'm using right now it's

00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:01,789
set to nothing but since i've plugged it

00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:03,709
in to the my invisible x descent I'll

00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:08,599
just tell it yeah I want you to start

00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:10,129
playing my ex synth for me and which

00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:11,839
instrument do I want well there's a

00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:14,179
bunch of different instruments that that

00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,799
are pre-programmed into X sense you can

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,659
get into modeling your own sounds as

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,119
well if you want X synth is pretty

00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:23,719
flexible but we'll just grab the first

00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:25,579
one and we'll say okay okay so now we've

00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:27,829
got like this invisible since we've got

00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:31,459
our computer pretty much ready to go in

00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:32,959
terms of controlling it the weird thing

00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:36,739
about MIDI data is that it doesn't

00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:38,509
really exist yet so we can't do we need

00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:42,049
to create not just a track for it we

00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,909
need to create a clip for it so a clip

00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:45,379
is exactly what gets created by default

00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,959
when we start recording sounds from the

00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:50,119
real world but there is no clip for MIDI

00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:52,969
yet so we'll make a new clip which I

00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,009
usually do with this little graphical

00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:57,559
button up here where it says new clip I

00:32:55,009 --> 00:33:01,249
think it's in yeah here it is clip menu

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:03,709
and then new and then we get what a lot

00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:05,419
of people call our piano roll so this is

00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:08,749
kind of like one of those player pianos

00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,669
like we're like little dots are all over

00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:12,199
the page and they turn it on and it

00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:15,440
starts playing the piano automatically

00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:17,959
this is exactly the same thing so if I

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,459
grab my little pencil tool here or I

00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:22,539
don't even have to do anything yet I can

00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,539
just kind of audition it

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:42,740
so I could I can draw in all the

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:45,259
different notes that i want that that's

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,909
the aha voice right there so because

00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,860
we've defined it I mean we can change it

00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:55,720
to its its MIDI so we don't have to keep

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,720
the aha voice that i chose immediately

00:33:56,499 --> 00:34:03,649
yes ok so MIDI wants to be change I mean

00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:05,179
it wants to be saved I should say which

00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:08,470
I guess it just did automatically for me

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:11,060
which is weird it didn't use to do that

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,919
but yeah so now if we if we play this

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,490
back it should be playing my loop at

00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:20,050
first and then my MIDI should come in

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,050
and then we should change loops so

00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:32,179
and that's that's what we got so far

00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,580
admittedly not the best thing you've

00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,540
ever heard but this is how it all starts

00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:40,550
this is how hits are being written today

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,350
so yeah so I mean that's pretty simple

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:48,970
again I mean any questions so far I

00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:51,970
think it's pretty simple really yes no

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,970
question

00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:05,170
so someone asked if there's an

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:09,250
arpeggiator function not not so much

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,580
that I can recall built-in mic actually

00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:15,970
I'm pretty sure it's not built in so but

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,500
if you get like a midi controller so

00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,300
this is just like this was actually

00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,130
really overpriced I wish I could say

00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,140
this this little thing is like 12 bucks

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,150
it was like 45 bucks which is a really

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:27,400
bad deal but I needed something and so I

00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,890
just I bought it but anyway it's really

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,470
it's it's a basic little keyboard it's

00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:34,470
this is not terribly touch sensitive

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,780
yeah in fact it's not touch sensitive at

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:44,320
all so you you know you get one velocity

00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:47,740
no matter how hard you hit but I mean

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,780
whatever its USB so you plug it in well

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,580
you open up the box and you take out the

00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,380
little disk that comes for windows and

00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,810
mac users and you throw that in the

00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:00,280
trash can then you take this and you

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:03,490
plug it into USB if you're lucky it'll

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,900
just work like I mean it's just working

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,850
for me but i think i probably have

00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,050
presets and stuff like that it's not

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,000
hard to get this thing to work though

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,160
what you do is you go back to queue

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,280
tractor you go back to the connections

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,690
window where we again define like okay

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,090
we're sending a signal to our computer

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,790
from something we want you to send it to

00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:26,890
hear we're no longer dealing with audio

00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:29,500
so we'll go over to midi and midi and

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,470
you see here that I've got a MIDI

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:36,220
through I've got an LP k 25 which is

00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:38,680
what this is an LP k 25 and then I've

00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,330
got the default q tractor MIDI stuff

00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,950
which we don't need to to worry about

00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,869
because we've got this so we've got the

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,060
MIDI device outside of our computer and

00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:54,160
we're sending it again already kind of

00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,960
hooked up for me to to Q tractor so it

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,060
was already plugged in for me but if you

00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,770
plugged in your device you got your

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,869
track setup you've got your MIDI data

00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,180
all configure you got your synth

00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,400
configured and you start pressing it and

00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,950
you're not hearing anything don't panic

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,500
just go to your connections window go to

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,820
the MIDI tab look for your device it

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,260
should show up as a

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,940
a as a source as a readable client from

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,680
huge actors point of view this is a

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:24,880
readable client because it's going into

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,620
q tractor you you click on the the MIDI

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,360
channel that you want or the MIDI data

00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,280
that you want to send and you just

00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:39,610
connect it to this guy so if I

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:41,020
disconnect this now I I do have a preset

00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,690
setup that's why it's just working

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,880
there's I have a patch bay set up so

00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,980
that if i have this plugged in it it

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,210
patches it for me so you'll just have to

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,980
take my word for it if i had

00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,410
disconnected that and if my computer was

00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,210
less friendly and then let me do that

00:37:53,410 --> 00:38:00,040
then you would not hear anything I can I

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:02,320
can see and now we'll connect it and

00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,980
then there would be a line there and

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,590
then that would happen so it's super

00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,390
simple not a big deal at all but what

00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,880
what's cool about this then is that you

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:16,290
can go in here and you can say you know

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,110
I don't I'm not really feeling the I

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,620
can't get this this quite right it's

00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,620
awkward

00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,880
actually I don't even think I needed to

00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:46,760
do that sorry I could have just deleted

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:50,570
that entirely yeah so we'll arm this

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,130
MIDI track for recording will say that

00:38:50,570 --> 00:39:09,260
we're going to record and we'll hit play

00:38:52,130 --> 00:39:12,590
and as you can see we've got the MIDI

00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,180
data Oh an arm it just so we don't

00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:24,020
accidentally record over what we just

00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:24,890
did and it's just playing back so the

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,410
cool thing about one of these

00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:30,220
controllers is that they have our peji

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,220
ators a lot of times

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,030
you

00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,230
I'm amazing right I'm just like yeah

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,870
that's that's what these guys get you so

00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,720
and like I say this is like a really

00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,610
really bad this is this is not i would

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,280
not recommend this one it's overpriced

00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,800
and under featured but there are really

00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,090
nice ones for about twice as much but

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,430
you get a whole bunch of nice features

00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,700
are you know better arpeggiator is more

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,410
options control over over a lot of

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,930
different aspects of the notes touch

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,240
sensitivity stuff like that so they're

00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,710
they're easy to they're easy to find

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,730
they're everywhere they're there by

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:12,610
roland there by oxygen there by arid all

00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:15,250
akai yamaha i think probably has some

00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:19,060
and you just plug them into USB and more

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:21,760
more it's very likely that your computer

00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,580
will just see it as a midi device and be

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,090
able to use it to control a cue tractor

00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:30,280
now since it's MIDI data you can go in

00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,080
once you if you just approximate playing

00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,030
it in and you realize that you're not

00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,980
very good at playing then you can go

00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,740
back in and you can you can adjust

00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,230
things or you can say well i really

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:43,780
liked how i started but i hated

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,120
everything after after a certain point

00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,330
so i'll just delete that and then I'll

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,410
just you know copy the notes with just

00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,410
normal control see

00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:08,430
and just completely change you know

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:09,809
everything and that's kind of the

00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,309
advantage of MIDI but I mean especially

00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,950
if you if you've got a tune in your head

00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,839
and you're not good enough on that weird

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,240
piano roll looking thing if you can just

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,369
kind of get the notes in on a keyboard

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:29,240
you can go back in and retouch them

00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:29,240
however you want them to really sound oh

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:36,569
yeah and there's one other thing about

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:38,520
editing called quantization so if you

00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:40,020
got out of the notes right but you find

00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:47,849
that you're just like a little bit off

00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:49,500
on your time you can go into tools you

00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:53,160
can select the notes that are a little

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,549
bit off go into tools and you can

00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,099
quantize them meaning that if you you

00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:03,930
know you want them to definitely hit on

00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:05,970
on the beat on every I think this would

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,950
be quarter note which I don't think

00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,450
would really yeah that would work so we

00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:13,049
could quantize it to every quarter note

00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:16,349
or if we admit to actually play it on

00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:18,349
every eighth note or whatever so you you

00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:22,619
can really and you can transpose you can

00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:24,650
do lots of different things with with

00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:27,329
any any aspect of the MIDI data

00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,190
including like velocity so this keyboard

00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:32,029
doesn't have touch sensitivity so you

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:37,200
can go in and actually raise or lower

00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:39,390
how hard that note hits and kind of

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,970
impose sort of a little bit of I don't

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:45,109
know humanity on to something that the

00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,109
computers just playing back

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:57,049
does it sound that different actually to

00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:59,089
me but yeah yeah so there's I mean

00:42:57,049 --> 00:43:01,430
there's fluid there's a sound fonts that

00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:03,019
do velocity really well and you can go

00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,430
in there and like tell it well I really

00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:06,109
meant this piano part to be really

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,359
really soft and then I wanted that big

00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:10,039
cord to be really loud and you can you

00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:16,329
can do that manually if you don't have

00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:22,069
touch sensitive keyboard um let's see

00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:26,079
how am i doing on time I'm good how many

00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:29,450
more minutes Oh perfect okay great so

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,910
the other I mean the really cool thing

00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:38,329
about well another cool thing about Q

00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:40,039
tractor is that you can do all kinds of

00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:42,410
different effects on whatever you play

00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,539
or whatever you've brought in like if

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,509
it's these pre-built loops or your voice

00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:51,019
whatever you've got in Q tractor since

00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:55,489
each one is on a separate track it sees

00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:58,519
all of these as well sort of like

00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:59,690
separate separate instances of sound if

00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:04,309
that makes any sense let me demonstrate

00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:08,469
something really quick just to kind of

00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:08,469
show you the difference

00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:28,450
so this is obviously audacity and I will

00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:28,450
grab something

00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:51,420
oh I just tried to import a zip file

00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:53,010
sorry just don't want to keep using

00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,700
those same sound loops but I guess we

00:44:53,010 --> 00:45:01,589
will alright so here we have something

00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:04,079
in audacity sorry so you just have to

00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:05,819
get used to that drum beat so let's say

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,799
that we we love this drum beat because

00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:11,220
we keep using it but we want it to have

00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:13,230
a little bit of depth maybe so we go

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,970
into the effects we go down to whatever

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,450
affects we most like and I think it'll

00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:20,490
be really obvious if I use a reverb

00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:29,099
effect so I'll throw a little bit of

00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:44,309
reverb on there or a lot bit that was a

00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:47,940
lot but let me do that over maybe still

00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:49,950
a lot but listen to do you see how it

00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,809
cuts off at the end there that shouldn't

00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:54,059
happen right I like that does that's not

00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:56,039
how voices or sounds work in real life

00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:58,829
like if you're in a big Cathedral and

00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,599
you shout eppo you know you'll hear

00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:02,190
yourself like echoing and it just kind

00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,990
of gradually fades out it doesn't just

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:08,940
like okay I'm out of echo now and it

00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:10,950
just stops so that's how audacity sees

00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,920
things and like I said you can you can

00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:15,329
kind of fake that you could say and this

00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,460
is how I do it when I am working in

00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:24,210
audacity I just create another track

00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:29,490
stereo track in this case and I grabbed

00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:32,279
the the last note that I want to sound

00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,500
like it's echoing paste it underneath it

00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:36,390
this is like a common old like

00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,339
trick where you know if you want sort of

00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,829
an effects but you don't want to screw

00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:46,319
up the layer that that it's on you can

00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:47,880
just grab that thing and then well what

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:54,480
you'd really have to do is generate more

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:58,190
silence so that the reverb carries over

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,190
and then you put the reverb on this guy

00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:11,840
not terribly happy with this reverb tail

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:16,790
level reflection area so you have

00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:18,650
something like this right so it just

00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:24,170
keeps going and going and going it

00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:25,970
doesn't just it doesn't just cut off

00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:30,890
like it would if we had just put that

00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:39,890
reverb effect on that last note like

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:41,330
this it's nothing there so the reason

00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,460
it's doing that is because like I say

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,250
you're actually editing like the the

00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:49,599
sound file in in audacity that's not

00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,599
what you're doing in queue tractor

00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,370
in q tractor we are applying effects to

00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,410
sort of like well what we're really

00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:07,170
doing is we're placing a new processor

00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,030
an effects processor between the the

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,390
sound being played in the computer and

00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:14,190
it being put through your speakers so

00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,230
you could almost imagine it like if we

00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:19,260
were going into here and adding a new

00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:21,270
panel for effects so we've got our

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,030
little we've got a track with this drum

00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:28,350
beat on it if I grab my mixer window

00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:36,060
which you can do with view windows mixer

00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:38,300
it pops this up and let's see so we've

00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,300
got

00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:51,050
can't see it so we've got this track

00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:52,880
here to add a effect into it you simply

00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,560
right click on sort of this empty space

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,560
here it's supposed to be sort of a

00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,450
little hardware rack really but doesn't

00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,940
look like it but it's an empty space

00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:05,180
here so if you right click and click add

00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:07,250
plugin now you can add we wouldn't want

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,680
to add a synth because we're happy with

00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:13,250
the sound that exists there so instead

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,530
we'll we'll add for instance a reverb so

00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,200
I'll just grab the same reverb plugin

00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:21,890
that we were using before it's the G

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:26,080
verb plug-in from the lad spa well from

00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:26,080
the Steve Harris set of lad spa plugins

00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:36,910
we've got our yeah yeah I sure do

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,170
yeah so yes so the question was these

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,670
these plugins that i'm using are not

00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,710
specific to q tractor and that is

00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,440
absolutely correct yeah so all of these

00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:19,960
plugins there you know like everything

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,060
else in free software there it's very

00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,420
modular right so you might install Q

00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,040
Jack control and then Q tractor and then

00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,079
you won't you'll go in to create your

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,320
MIDI file and you'll say oh I've got no

00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,089
sense or oh I wanted to add a reverb

00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,190
effect and there's no reverb there well

00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:38,680
that's because you need to also install

00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:41,890
like the plug-in or the yeah the plug-in

00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:45,040
sets for those synthesizers or those

00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:48,430
effects so the really popular one is the

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,470
Steve Harris lads beset it's literally

00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:56,170
like a hundred plugins or something it's

00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:58,900
just reverbs flangers phasers just all

00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:01,150
kinds of effect compressors eq all kinds

00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,520
of different effects for free and then

00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:05,800
they work I mean I you i'm using the

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,540
same reverb for instance in q tractors i

00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,369
was just using an audacity so it's

00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,510
completely it doesn't really care as

00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:13,329
long as that application that you're

00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:15,550
using understands lab spa or whatever

00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:17,349
you need dizzy or whatever then you can

00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,150
use that plugin in that application so

00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:21,420
that's really nice because it is i mean

00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:25,450
again it's very modular you can you can

00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:29,859
change things over like that so yea lad

00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:31,480
spa is one calf CA LF is another trying

00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:32,950
to think of there's a couple of there

00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,740
there are more those are the two that

00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:39,970
comes immediately to mind for like

00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:41,290
effects like this so the feedback that

00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,630
we were just hearing is because i had

00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:46,030
left the the microphone capture device

00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:48,310
on so you saw that the solution there

00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:49,930
again is not really to panic you just go

00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:54,400
to your connections window which is in

00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:57,220
the view windows connections and you get

00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,400
your two panels of things that are

00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:03,220
happening on your audio system and you

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,810
find the the capture input that that is

00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,700
capturing the sound that is causing fees

00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:09,160
the feedback in this case and you simply

00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,599
disconnect those two those two ports

00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,230
from each other and it's just like

00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:16,140
you're literally just going to an audio

00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,370
recorder and unplugging the microphone

00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:20,660
so

00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:26,150
now we shouldn't get that feedback it's

00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:28,370
good so we've applied a reverb effect to

00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,320
this first track so if we play it back

00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:33,050
we should just hear if I've set the

00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:41,360
reverb stem I appropriately we should

00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:43,880
hear some reverb here that's not even

00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:50,420
remotely correct but again you get the

00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:55,600
idea I need to put a much more we need

00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,600
to dampen that I think which is that way

00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:06,460
really reflection not so much and dry

00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:06,460
level we need dry see what happens here

00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,950
it's better it is that's pretty rieber

00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:15,380
me but you get the idea right so as you

00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:17,240
can hear like maybe you heard because I

00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:23,089
was talking but listened even after I

00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:24,950
play even after i press stop you still

00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:26,810
hear that reverb effect right that's

00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,060
because it's not cute writer doesn't

00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:31,430
care if sound is being played it's got

00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,020
that reverb on the track and so if the

00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,790
sound comes through that effects

00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,339
processor then it's generating the

00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:39,440
reverb sending it to your speaker and if

00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:42,290
you stop playback you'll still hear that

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,270
effect or if you you know if you if it's

00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,820
the end of the line for that drum track

00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,800
I'm going to mute this horrible synth

00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,050
line but if it's the end of the line for

00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,720
that drum track will still will still

00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,160
hear the reverb from track 1 we don't

00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,990
have reverb yet on that on the

00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:04,730
changeover on track to so we won't hear

00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:06,670
your reverb there so you can still hear

00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:12,010
the reverb over that second track right

00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:15,050
so that's how you do reverb on a track

00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:16,970
based level now if you wanted that same

00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,410
reverb effect on your second drum track

00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,510
if you're trying to kind of marry those

00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:24,080
things together then you can always just

00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:26,540
right-click no you can't you can drag it

00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,550
and drop it and you can either move that

00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,349
reverb effect over to the second track

00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:32,839
or you can simply copy it over there and

00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:41,000
then you would have the same reverb

00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:43,760
effect on both on both track 1 and 2 any

00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,950
questions so far I think that's most of

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,960
what Q tractor does that's unique from

00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:50,710
like audacity and stuff like that but if

00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,710
you have questions so far

00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:02,670
yes it does have a metronome function

00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:03,869
which I never use so I'm probably not

00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:08,839
going to remember off the top of my head

00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:17,489
where it is I think it is in options

00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:19,469
view options and you can go to somewhere

00:55:17,489 --> 00:55:22,049
in here I think there's a metric yeah

00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:26,009
here it is so you enable the metronome

00:55:22,049 --> 00:55:27,420
the different kind of sound I'm not

00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:29,039
remembering how to turn that on from

00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,380
here though oh here actually this little

00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:40,739
button right there metronome that should

00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:43,199
probably do it no I never use them the

00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:47,189
metronome because that's just not how I

00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:49,019
rolling but yeah it does have a

00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:50,519
metronome I've I've heard it before I

00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,239
know it exists I just don't remember off

00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,769
the top my head how to turn it on but oh

00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:58,170
that's probably yeah okay that would

00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,969
make sense let's try that will add a

00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:01,769
blank track will make it an audio track

00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:05,339
this is good review for everyone to see

00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:08,189
and then we'll arm that for recording

00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:10,559
and then we'll hit record and we've got

00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:15,449
our metronome activated we think so

00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:17,910
we'll hit play perfect no metronome but

00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:20,069
yeah it trust me it exists it can be it

00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,410
can be turned on I just I didn't

00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:29,279
anticipate that question I didn't cheat

00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:32,839
and read ahead yes oh sure in view

00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:32,839
options here

00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:44,320
oh thanks hey great okay let this should

00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,320
work this time

00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:54,550
no still didn't work

00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:07,780
oh I didn't why didn't you say so before

00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:09,190
I tried it again oh well I don't really

00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,510
have an instrument I don't remember

00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:14,200
doing that before and I know I've heard

00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:15,970
it in here I could be wrong maybe I'm

00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,110
thinking of a different application that

00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:20,590
I've heard it on but I'm pretty sure it

00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:24,580
was here because I just wrote a book

00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:26,200
about this thing so it's there I it's

00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,970
it's somewhere in my head I just can't

00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:33,370
remember like how to get there yeah the

00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:35,500
addition for soon is coming soon any

00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,330
other questions not about metronomes any

00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:45,310
any question about anything other than

00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:48,070
metronomes yeah okay so to like balance

00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:50,050
the track essentially yeah so that's a

00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,210
that's actually a really good point so

00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,790
if you if you've finished your your

00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:57,610
composition you're really happy with it

00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:59,620
you want to then obviously export it as

00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:02,110
a file that you could then send out to

00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:04,090
friends or put on your musical player or

00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:07,210
whatever burn to a disc whatever you're

00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:08,410
going to do with it a lot of times

00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,450
that's called bouncing and other

00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:13,510
applications so if you've if you've used

00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:16,780
other sound software you might call it

00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:19,680
bounce a track or exporting that's my

00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:22,630
that that might be how you think of it

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:28,180
however you think of it what you need to

00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:32,470
do is create a new track for where the

00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:34,060
audio is going to go and I don't fail

00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,430
this as well because I have not done

00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,380
this in a while but we'll give it a will

00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,730
give it a go so you get you create a new

00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,270
track I'm going to go ahead and name

00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:45,690
this one bounce so we know what it

00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,690
contains

00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:59,790
and then in my connections window I'm

00:58:51,810 --> 00:59:02,880
going to pipe the output of Q tractor to

00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:04,560
the input of Q tractor which seems

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,650
really dangerous and you're like surely

00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:11,040
this can't be right but it's it's

00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:15,420
actually right so now if we arm our

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:20,790
bounce track for recording we hit record

00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:26,190
and play we're at the end of the yep

00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:32,670
sorry go back to the beginning and then

00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:38,370
hit record and play you can see the you

00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:39,630
can see those sound waves here and you

00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,860
would just let that play through and

00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:43,110
obviously you would let it continue

00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,760
through the very last moment of reverb

00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:46,730
that you want to capture or whatever you

00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,200
are you're doing and then you've got

00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:51,270
you've got this track that contains

00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:58,830
everything so you basically done a mix

00:59:51,270 --> 01:00:03,300
down yes yeah we can should be able to

00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:06,980
hear that I mean it certainly looks like

01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,980
it it should be there

01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:21,360
so it gets basically everything you know

01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:23,220
in your queue tractor project it's just

01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,350
it's i mean it is what we just did we

01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:29,190
took the output that it's sending to the

01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:31,980
speaker to another place of it you know

01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:34,590
to the input of itself so once you arm

01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,330
this a for recording that becomes the

01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:38,220
input and it records whatever it's

01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:41,550
sending out to the speaker it's kind of

01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,230
like T the T EE on the command line you

01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:45,420
know you're you're getting to send the

01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:50,610
output to one thing as well as to

01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:55,950
another place so now what you'd want to

01:00:50,610 --> 01:01:01,350
do is simply export just that track okay

01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:03,420
export the track as an audio track so

01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:05,520
I've muted everything else or I could

01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:12,180
alternately simply solo this one it

01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:14,310
would be the same same effect as an

01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:17,070
audio file and you can save it out as

01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:20,070
whatever you want to hear it's coming up

01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:21,540
default as an OGG file you don't

01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,370
necessarily have to do that there's a

01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:27,060
lot of different options again in view

01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:29,700
options I think it's probably in yeah

01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:32,220
audio the capture and export I just have

01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,170
set to augs but you know you've got I

01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,390
mean in real life you would probably not

01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:38,580
be exporting I wouldn't be exporting to

01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:42,060
OGG probably you'd probably export to

01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:43,890
like a wave or flac something that's not

01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:46,100
going to try to compress it for you

01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:51,090
unless that's what you're looking for

01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:55,530
and anyway you simply export that track

01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:57,960
as an audio file and and then you've got

01:01:55,530 --> 01:02:00,510
just the the mixdown of your audio in

01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:04,830
one track that you can distribute online

01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:09,140
or to friends or whatever any other

01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:09,140
questions yes

01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:14,170
oh yeah thank you yeah yeah so I can't

01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,640
believe I forgot that because that

01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,349
that's actually a new feature that's

01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,510
something that our door oh the question

01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:22,000
was can you do automations in your track

01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:24,099
yes you can that's something that our

01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,410
door has had for a very long time and

01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:29,349
cue tractor being I guess probably a new

01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:31,510
air project has just recently obtained

01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:35,079
but it's really really nice it's it's

01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:39,549
really cool and you can automate really

01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:43,690
everything so it it's right here in this

01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:46,480
track there's a little mountain range

01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:53,500
icon that's the automation icon so if

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:58,539
you turn that on for a track you can

01:02:53,500 --> 01:03:01,150
select whatever attribute of that track

01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:05,289
you want to change so it might be simply

01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:06,640
you want to fade in on that track or you

01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:08,829
might want to pan it from left to right

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:13,480
or something like that you can do that

01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:17,289
you can you can make that happen so I

01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:19,390
having the wrong tool you can you can do

01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:23,559
that with the automation tool which is

01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:26,849
right up here at the top automation tool

01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:30,160
it's a little arrow with a star by it

01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:31,960
you grab that and then you can you know

01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,630
it mean we've all seen this I'm sure you

01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:36,250
know it's just saying okay I want I want

01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:43,660
it to maybe start out really really

01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:46,059
quiet using a mouse pad or a trackpad

01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:49,599
for this is not recommended by the way

01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:53,200
but yeah you can you can change all that

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,349
stuff what's really nice though is that

01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,180
I mean you can certainly have more

01:03:55,349 --> 01:04:00,400
automation than just one you don't have

01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:02,980
to just choose one attribute you could

01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,319
change the the panning at one moment and

01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:07,359
then switch over and pant and change the

01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:09,039
gain or something like that you can also

01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:11,019
change all the different kinds of

01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,539
attributes of any plugin on that track

01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:16,029
so if you want it to start out as normal

01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:18,640
drums and then as it goes on to get

01:04:16,029 --> 01:04:22,150
rever be as it goes you can add that as

01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,789
well so you might you know alter the

01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:27,979
reef

01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:30,079
herb the tail decibel level of your of

01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:32,419
the the of the sound coming back from

01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,859
the reverb so you can change that again

01:04:32,419 --> 01:04:35,390
you just have to make sure and this is

01:04:33,859 --> 01:04:38,119
the the thing that I forget all the time

01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:40,900
is to be in the automation tool that

01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:42,799
will trip you up but yeah you've got

01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:44,749
everything and that goes the same for

01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:47,959
for MIDI data if you've got if you want

01:04:44,749 --> 01:04:51,140
to change the velocity of MIDI data you

01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:53,569
can do that without track automation you

01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,519
can even think you can switch what's in

01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:57,380
that sits playing or which wich patch

01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:00,099
it's playing on the scent so there's a

01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:04,419
lot of stuff that you can do on the fly

01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:07,910
just as an automation thing on the track

01:05:04,419 --> 01:05:09,499
with the automation button that was a

01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:20,439
good question because I almost forgot to

01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:22,729
mention that anything else well oh

01:05:20,439 --> 01:05:25,459
really I don't okay I haven't looked at

01:05:22,729 --> 01:05:27,679
that on hydrogen so oh the question was

01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:31,069
can you sync for instance a program like

01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:32,809
hydrogen with Q tractor and the answer

01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:36,109
to that is yes I don't know what how

01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:39,949
they do it in order but hydrogen and Q

01:05:36,109 --> 01:05:41,689
tractor both use the same MIDI clock so

01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:44,390
hydrogen is just like a drum machine so

01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:46,789
if you really hated this Bongo loop that

01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:50,390
I somehow found and assaulted us with

01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:52,699
for an hour then you can just go out to

01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:55,429
hydrogen and make your own drum beat in

01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:57,919
a very traditional kind of like I don't

01:05:55,429 --> 01:06:01,640
think I have it installed right now just

01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:03,619
because I've yeah no i don't but it

01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:05,269
hydrogen is really nice it's a it's like

01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:06,469
having it's like going out to the store

01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:07,999
and buying a drum machine and bringing

01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:09,589
it home and you've got all you can make

01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:11,869
your own drum kits and you can use

01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:14,599
samples to trigger different sounds and

01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:17,209
you can then loop those so it's it's a

01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:19,729
midi program so it'll pop up when you

01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:22,159
want to you want to pipe it into q

01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:23,599
tractor it's something that would be

01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:28,249
available to you in your connections

01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:30,640
window as and i think i haven't used it

01:06:28,249 --> 01:06:33,650
in a while i think it comes up as a midi

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,839
device that so so basically when the

01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:36,590
computer senses oh my gosh the midi

01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:39,110
thing says start

01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:45,410
playing now then it'll play at the same

01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:47,630
rate and stuff like that so you might

01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:50,410
have to set the beats per minute

01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:53,240
manually I don't know if there's like a

01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:55,130
magical sort of like make these to play

01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,240
at the same rate but they should play as

01:06:55,130 --> 01:07:01,760
long as you've got them both at the same

01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:06,340
BPM they should play at the same BPM any

01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,340
other questions yes

01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:15,810
hmm

01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,570
no but that is actually something I was

01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:26,580
talking to scott l from the ubuntu

01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:29,790
studio project about that very thing

01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:32,370
like just saying hey what if we got g

01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:35,910
verb or yeah a guitar distortion pedal

01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:37,680
and said if you want you know crunchy

01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:40,020
guitar try this setting if you want

01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,270
cathedral sound try this on G verb if

01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,730
you want like you're talking to a tin

01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:46,500
can try this you know you and that's

01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,870
that's a great idea and we'll have to

01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:53,760
start doing that I guess the talk is

01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:57,930
over I'm sort of feeling but feel free

01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:59,820
to go to Slacker media info or just see

01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:02,610
me outside at the booth I'm like right

01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:05,310
across the way and I I have a lot of

01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,410
resources there for making music and art

01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:10,200
and stuff on slackware but it's

01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:12,350
applicable nevertheless everything thank

01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,350
you

01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:09,450
prospects I every way this is the way to

01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:11,370
better utilize all your resources and it

01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:14,430
makes managing all your resources pretty

01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:19,290
easy all of the innovation is happening

01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:22,650
in open source the collaborative nature

01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:25,320
and of the you know of the community and

01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:27,210
the speed at which these are these you

01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:29,280
know these these deficiencies these bugs

01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:31,650
are getting discovered and then fixed is

01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:33,360
it I think that really shows the power

01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:36,120
of the you know of the open source

01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:38,270
community it is global and it's

01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:41,820
definitely because of the users

01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:47,700
community people are extremely friendly

01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:49,500
and almost ready to help if you go an

01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:51,720
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,360
helping each other out and they're all

01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,040
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,030
product is transparent for everyone

01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,980
everyone can look at the code base

01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:03,720
everyone can see how close darkest is

01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:09,570
being built nothing nothing is

01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:12,240
proprietary everything is open in many

01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:16,440
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:20,190
ongoing health cloudstack the most

01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:23,940
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:26,730
was our first developer boot camp

01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:29,400
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:33,360
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:37,530
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:40,350
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:42,900
chairs in the room twice everything

01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:46,230
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:49,199
is open source and so I don't think that

01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:50,969
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:54,000
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:56,699
computing and so i think it's i think

01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,050
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:10:56,699 --> 01:11:01,790
about cloud computing you're really

01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,790
talking about a source cloud computing

01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:08,130
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:10,530
deployments you'll have dozens of data

01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:14,550
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:17,790
data centers these hardware is going to

01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:21,030
fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:23,489
handle number one that mass scale number

01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:26,219
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:29,100
that inevitably happens in large

01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:33,270
deployments started working on cobb deck

01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:36,540
over four years ago and it was the

01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:38,310
original set of people working on it had

01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:42,420
a background of delivering software

01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:46,680
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:50,280
lots of users actually using it high

01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:53,370
availability is a key feature multiple

01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,380
hypervisors support different network

01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:58,050
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:11:55,380 --> 01:12:00,330
you better while step management server

01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:04,020
can be deployed in different physical

01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:05,670
machines it definitely has a huge

01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:10,650
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:13,230
there's a major movie studio that they

01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:16,530
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:18,510
to transcode video and i thought that

01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:20,160
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:23,430
more fascinating is what they did during

01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:26,219
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:27,390
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:29,220
lunch was over they would just

01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:33,330
all the instances and go back to doing

01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:34,980
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:37,050
so many different aspects and there's no

01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:39,420
one person that's kind of like a master

01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:43,560
of all those realms I think CloudStack

01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:45,780
as a project is going to be one of the

01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:49,830
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:55,230
most feature fallen and and robust

01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:58,160
platforms out they were out on senior

01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:58,160
living through the clouds dag

01:13:10,989 --> 01:13:13,050
you

01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:21,420
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:23,369
ago we could not have imagined that

01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:25,590
asterisk would not only become the most

01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:27,719
widely adopted open source communication

01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,760
software on the planet but that it would

01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:32,280
impact the entire industry in the way

01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,260
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,900
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:38,849
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,920
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:13:38,849 --> 01:13:42,360
transition of power from the hands of

01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,610
the traditional proprietary phone

01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:47,010
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:48,960
administrators of phone systems using

01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:50,190
this power our customers have created

01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,139
all sorts of business changing

01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,969
applications from small office phone

01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:56,489
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:58,110
to international carrier networks in

01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:59,880
fact there's even an entire country

01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:02,489
those communications infrastructure runs

01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,409
on esters the gym has always been about

01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:06,119
creating technology that expands

01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:08,280
communications capabilities in ways that

01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:09,480
we could never have imagined and that's

01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,880
part of what's game-changing about

01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:14,579
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,679
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:18,780
IP phones that extends control of the

01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:20,550
user all the way to the desktop the

01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,260
launch of these new products represents

01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:24,360
the next phase indigenous history of

01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:26,760
innovation these are the first and only

01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,050
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,760
power of asterisks when we first

01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:31,409
discussed our expectations for building

01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,019
a family of phones for use with asterisk

01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:35,820
our requirements were pretty simple we

01:14:34,019 --> 01:14:37,559
asked the team to build the phones such

01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:39,780
that they were easy to install integrate

01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:41,610
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:44,190
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:45,809
that goal user feedback is validating

01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:47,940
that when it comes to operation with

01:14:45,809 --> 01:14:50,340
astro space systems including our own

01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:52,920
Switchvox based product these are the

01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,239
easiest to use best integrated most

01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,820
interoperable products on the market

01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:58,820
today the Digium family of phones will

01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:00,869
initially include three IP des hommes

01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,820
uniquely designed to complement any

01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:04,679
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:07,349
these phones are different for a number

01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:09,989
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:15:07,349 --> 01:15:11,429
designed for use with esters secondly

01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:13,039
we've made it really easy to

01:15:11,429 --> 01:15:15,449
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:17,130
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:18,840
to access information inside of

01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:20,410
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:23,050
between an application and

01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:25,210
phone additionally we've created an

01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:27,340
applications engineer that allows users

01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:30,550
and developers to create and run their

01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:32,320
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:34,270
done all of this at a very compelling

01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,950
price point at digium we're always

01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:38,080
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:40,630
the best value in business phone systems

01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:42,190
and also give them the power to create

01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:44,320
their own solutions or any

01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:46,060
communications challenge well continue

01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,500
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:49,540
astros cooler bastard more

01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,160
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,620
asterisk employed communications even

01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:57,120
easier and together we'll change the way

01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:57,120
