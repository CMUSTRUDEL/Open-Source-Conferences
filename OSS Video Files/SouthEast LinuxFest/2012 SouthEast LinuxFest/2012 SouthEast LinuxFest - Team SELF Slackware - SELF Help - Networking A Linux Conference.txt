gotcha okay well first of all we had

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,110
planned on putting slides together this

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,289
morning to have something to show you

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,250

beautiful but selves and as you might

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,330
have figured out we've pretty well been

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,700
putting out fires all day and all night

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,290
last night and we use beer for some of

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,409
those last night i'll have to be honest

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,030
but um we've pretty well been too busy

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,380
sadly to put together any type of

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,750
presentation and so this will be our

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,570
presentation i'm really sorry I really

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:32,509
am but it is what it is we can't really

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:35,549

development team which sounds all fancy

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,509
but really isn't pretty well carry the

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,729
light loads I'm not really qualified to

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,130
be much more than that but you know xorg

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,040
stuff like that also founded the slack

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,780
builds org team back in 06 along with

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,110

using slackware since what I've been

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:59,090
used in slackware since about nineteen

00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:01,270
ninety-eight i believe and well I try to

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,740
be an email consultant

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:12,400
mighty close to that how about let's do

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:16,180
the hand mic that one's better anyway

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:21,310
right okay okay anyway I try to do email

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:24,960
consulting on the side and I work with

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,580
slack builds org also and we've been

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,310
going crazy since we got here on

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,480
Thursday you want to take it first start

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,150
okay so I don't know how much background

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,560
you guys know about what was supposed to

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:44,260
happen and what actually happened about

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,600
three months ago the southeast linux

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,900
fest had talked with several different

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,450
perspective internet providers and

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,300
settled on time warner Time Warner Cable

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,780
said oh yes we have we are we already

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,340
provide cable to the hotel and so being

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,350
able to provide internet would not be an

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,010
issue at all we should be able to

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,750
provide you a cable modem put it

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,140
wherever you'd like you know closet out

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,150
in your work area whatever and we can

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,580
give you a 50 megabit connection for a

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,500
very reasonable rate and so the

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,810
southeast linux fest of course say yeah

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,650
that sounds great and we haven't thought

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,840
much about it since then roughly I think

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,550
I may have some of the timeframes not

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,430
quite right but I think a week or so

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,260
maybe two weeks ago Jeremy got a call or

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,820
email from someone with time warner and

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,110
he all this is in his name you know

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,550
Jeremy sands a coordinator of this and

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,520
somehow Time Warner had noticed that his

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,080
address is in South Carolina and so they

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,520
said hey wait you don't live in our

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,310
service area we can't provide you

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,680
service and so Jeremy sent a nice

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,830
message back and ice is probably not the

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,940
right word but you get the idea that

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,890
Haley would I want this from a house

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,900
this is for the Blake hotel so that got

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:07,750
fixed up and then we arrived what they

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,460
did we get here Wednesday well Thursday

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,810
30 the date you know Thursday the day

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,200
before all this was scheduled to start

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,040
we came up early Thursday morning

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,360
expecting that time

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,950
owner would be out to set up the

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,950
internet and indeed they had come out

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:26,110
Wednesday and came into the hotel looked

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,760
at the wherever the patch panel down in

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,120
the basement everything comes in here

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,800
and said oh we can't do this sorry we

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,320
can't set up any type of internet we

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,050
don't have the right stuff coming in and

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,270
so then Jeremy called them back after

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,040
that and said no you idiots and I think

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,690
that's kind of the word to use no we

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,180
don't want you to provide more service

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,550
to the hotel we want you to do what you

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,920
told us you would do when says pull some

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,310
coax from somewhere in here wherever you

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,380
come in drop us a cable modem and so

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,750
they came back out Thursday while we

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,180
were here to do that and it was at that

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,250
point that the tech that came out

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,150
happened to look at the coax in the

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,970
hotel and it's receive-only coax and to

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,630
make a long story short time warner said

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,900
sorry we can't do anything for you

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,790
however the tech said well we don't mind

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,320
pulling coax across the parking lot and

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,260
running into the building somewhere else

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,150
if the hotel is okay with that and so of

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,190
course we asked the hotel and the hotel

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,750
says oh yeah that's fine with us because

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,940
after all we're giving them a lot of

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,980
money and sure that's fine if you want

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,680
to run coax across a parking lot we have

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,630
no problem at all and so we told Time

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,340
Warner that and the time warner guy says

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,090
well that's fine i don't mind doing it

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,260
that's no problem at all but the access

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,110
point is out here in the middle of the

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,060
sidewalk and so to run coax or whatever

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,970
any type of cable out of that access

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,310
point we have to cross about that much

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:58,600
sidewalk which requires approval from

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,580
the city and so we got in touch with the

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,430
city and the city said oh yeah that's no

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,840
problem at all will approve it but Time

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,550
Warner has to make the request and so we

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,170
got back in touch with time warner and

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,420
it was about that point that we haven't

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:18,670
heard from him again and so this was the

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,400
day before the conference roughly around

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:23,940
noon when we all this kind of got kicked

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,940
in motion

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,950
so you know that's that tells you how

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,160
our event started off we really thought

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:41,729
this was going to be much easier and so

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:41,729
from there David David tell that story

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:52,240
ok so we're setting up our network

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:55,630
without internet and where we are

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,420
running the cabling find the access

00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,950
points trying to get them spread out so

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,180
that we have good coverage not too many

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:07,180
people on the single access point and

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,070
we're running down the walls trying to

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,260
hide the cables and trying to hide the

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,410
access points so people don't trip over

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:19,260
them kick them whatever happen to notice

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:23,500
a cat5 cable dangling from the ceiling

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,510
so we decided let's hook up to this cat

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,050
5 cable and see what we have there and

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:39,400
lo and behold we hit the Gateway for the

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:43,960
hotel Internet so yes this is secret so

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:48,190
then we we decide well we already have a

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,580
super long 200 yard or 200 foot run just

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,440
to get up there so rather than try and

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,250
do just some kind of coupler or anything

00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,790
we took a router and turned it into a

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:04,360
dumb switch and basically converted our

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,620
switch into the router repeater so that

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:12,550
we could get down this long run on the

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:14,290
wire and that's been working ok ish yeah

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:19,060
they got it capped off it's about two

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:22,990
megabit we ran speedtest on it it's ok

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:26,320
but the internet at the hotel is not

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:30,400
very good the front desk people have

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,700
issues their systems lag and we've been

00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,750
seeing that on our stuff directly tied

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:42,830
in so it's it's not been

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:44,330
been real good okay sure we really have

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:49,460
done some interesting stuff on the

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:50,510
inside which yeah we you want to get to

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,530
the internet that's the main thing

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,870
you're going to want from the network

00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:59,420
but that's not the only thing we have

00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:03,920
set up well initially it was three VLANs

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:06,980
virtual lands we have one for the staff

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,320
one for the vendors and one for the

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,990
public yeah VLAN for those of you don't

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,910
know it's a all right no I'm going to

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,710
have you explain what a beam is had to

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:27,050
get somebody neways talking about to do

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:30,620
this part a VLAN it's actually the

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,780
standard 802 dot1q but that's not real

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,400
important basically all it does is it

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,150
the data link layer where your mac

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,130
address is in a packet it adds an

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,050
additional field which is you know

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,710
basically a binary numerical

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,550
identification and you can do it either

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,360
on your on your box on your switch you

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:58,430
know various different locations and

00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:00,620
based on that based on that VLAN tag you

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,390
can have you know multiple subnets on a

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,240
single interface you can route them

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:08,210
differently yadda yadda for example

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,610
these are these access points you'll

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,460
notice that they're offering self public

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,850
self vendor and self staff those are

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,790
VLANs 10 20 and 30 whenever you connect

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,570
up the access point adds a VLAN tag and

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:26,480
then when it gets back to our our Linux

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,760
box we can serve a different DHCP range

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,530
based on that tag we can serve you into

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,300
a different subnet we can route you

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,240
differently we can offer different

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,190
services based on that so it's really

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,770
very simple and ridiculously powerful

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,510
when you consider it because you know

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,490
otherwise if you want you know different

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,860
subnets and you want to actually filter

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,390
on it or a route based on and such

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,470
you're going to have to have multiple

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,670
nics

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,360
you know you're going to have to have

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:55,820
one Nick for public one Nick for vendor

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,640
one Nick for staff and one net for your

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,800
internet and then we would actually have

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,830
to have a fifth Nick for our second

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,960
internet which we'll get to in a bit so

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,790
you know it's it's ridiculous right now

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:13,330
we're just running everything on to and

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:17,120
you know that seems to work real well so

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,650
anyhow what we did was once we got you

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,750
know the land here set up we had to

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,090
figure out what the hell we going to do

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,180
with this teeny little to megabit

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,880
connection and 700 people wanting to use

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,230
it and you know we had promised the

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,420
vendors they would have full internet

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,000
access so we had to give it to them and

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,620
there's quite a few vendors and you know

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,020
you can imagine that many people can

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,410
probably bring a 2 megabit link to its

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,850
knees and then you know staff is going

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,740
to need it for various different things

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,410
you know pool in the registration

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,150
database from their servers and whatnot

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:55,880
so you know there's that's a requirement

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,700
just around the conference and from

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,120
there we had to decide you know what are

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,520
we going to do for public and so we had

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,740
to do you know a best-effort we had to

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,830
notice some local services here and our

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,660
see Damon and stuff we allowed ICMP out

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,770
I think we allowed secure shell out as

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:19,400
well we couldn't allow HTTP because it

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:21,020
was just going to be too much oh yeah we

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,520
bought the ssh so I think we were

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,500
worried about people tunneling and once

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,230
you start getting people tunneling then

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:33,350
yeah that too megabit connection is

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:37,910
dial-up that's what I would have done

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:40,100
too that's the tragedy of the Commons

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:45,680
for you you can Wikipedia that now that

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:50,930
we got net if any of y'all want to go

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:53,060
come on I'm just rambling yeah okay hehe

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,590
thank you for stretching your 30 second

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,590
explanation out in 25 minutes

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:03,040
okay we've got our three VLANs as you

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,530
can see on the access points the they

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,950
correspond to what we have on the

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:14,580
ethernet also we've been different

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,690
levels of terms of service for those and

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:21,010
I'm going to that's going to go to

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:28,480
Robbie on that we've got separate

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:31,540
network ranges for each one of those we

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,750
don't care about what the actual IP

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:42,580
ranges are but we've given each

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:45,060
different privileges to each range yeah

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:50,320
what else do you want to cover on that

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:53,710
okay has everyone seen the at least the

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,020
self server at some point I guess I

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,490
guess if you tried to give out over HTTP

00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,980
you would have seen that because we were

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,030
basically capturing everything for a

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:07,360
while there as Rob here was pointing out

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,880
you know we we finally got some decent

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,890
internet but but before we get into that

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,260
what I was having to do with the the two

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,610
megabit connection is you know I you

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,710
know I don't know how many of you are

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,640
still limited in your home internet it

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,830
seems that most people these days have

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,720
it you know a cable connection or DSL or

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,480
something and I'm one of the unfortunate

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,770
ones to live far enough into the woods

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,570
that my internet options are dial-up or

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:37,000
some sort of mobile broadband and by

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:42,340
mobile broadband I think the broad part

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,200
of that is usually a big stretch but so

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm on basically cell phone connection

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,460
for my home internet still that that's

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,820
all I can get so the whole qos stuff was

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,390
something I had to learn at least

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,800
passively so early on or else my wife's

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,240
forays into YouTube and whatnot would

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,400
make the connection completely unusable

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,650
for me and that wasn't an option so

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,410
prioritizing SSH and various other

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:07,510
things early on was something I had to

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,860
learn and so I thought okay well I can

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,319
do that here and

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:15,400
so that's basically what I've done is on

00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:18,630
the two megabit connection we had DNS

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,089
traffic of course had first priority and

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,780
ssh had priority because you know the

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:27,640
staff and whatnot still needed SSH out

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,380
I'd have to pull it up to see you

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,770
exactly how prioritized everything but

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:36,670
there's qos in place for prioritizing

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,750
different forms of traffic and then you

00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,090
know I don't know how soon we wouldn't

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,520
get into this but anything he might have

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:50,429
anything else that before we get into

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:52,900
the new internet Republican yes so today

00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,030
Jeremy approach this and this has been

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,510
something he'd kind of talked about last

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:02,080
night wanting to do but he said well you

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:05,530
know i have 4g service from my sprint

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:11,230
phone and i'm getting 15 20 megabits

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:16,299
down on it can we use it to put all the

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:20,799
public self public traffic out on yeah

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:22,630
we can we don't really want to but we

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:29,260
can that's a little bit at work but i'm

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:34,960
sure we can do that and so i may let you

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:37,419
talk about this we home on a surface is

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,750
simple enough because you know you just

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,700
add another interface and you r out some

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,049
of the traffic out onto that interface

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,370
you know that's just a simple set up a

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,500
new routing table and boom everything's

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,140
fine the trouble is Jeremy said oh wait

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,380
no we can't do that because sprint looks

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,390
at does some deep packet inspection and

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,070
when they start seeing different user

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,340
agents that are not possible on a mobile

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,950
phone they send resets basically they

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,320
terminate the connection and so that's

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,140
great so okay he said can we tunnel that

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,600
through you know something openvpn ssh

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,240
town or whatnot and so okay we can do

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,710
that and that sounds a lot simple than

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,470
it is and I'm going to let Robb go into

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:23,350
some of that okay

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:28,710
we set up a VPN tunnel from Alan's

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:30,730
laptop which is stuck in the staff room

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:36,220
Alan's without it for the rest of the

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:42,480
show and from there it goes to a one of

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:50,260
our remote sites which is a in Indiana

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:55,150
you know what's name that company amna

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,980
City yeah we have a VPS with them and

00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,580
they've been we've been with them for

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,860
quite some time we've got everything

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:09,090
going through one of our IP addresses

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,090
there we bound that IP address which is

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:21,090
Alan's bringing up right now oh no ok

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,920
we're on the hotel okay anyway it's some

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:28,660
self dot slack builds org is the name of

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:31,060
it I don't know how that worked cuz we

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:36,400
got there yeah that's what I was

00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:38,950
thinking how can we do oh that's wrong

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,060
bigger land okay that's why we got that

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:45,280
address yeah everything goes through

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,620
this VP and well we had trouble setting

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,680
up the VPN of course we're trying to

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:55,330
tunnel through a 4g cell phone which is

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,150
it's not exactly tethered i guess it's a

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:03,090
wireless access point that you're his

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:07,810
laptop is connected to as a client well

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:10,090
you openvpn is best over UDP for

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:15,760
numerous reasons you don't want to run a

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:21,450
TCP tunnel inside a TCP stream you

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:23,810
really only need one instance of the TCP

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,050
error Corrections

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:31,220
error Corrections and error Corrections

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:35,360
and God I'll spit this out guaranteed

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,980
delivery right packet sequencing with

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,620
UDP you don't get any of that which is

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,630
exactly what you want for a VPN it'll be

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,670
reassembled on the other end as needed

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,820
and and packets that are needed will be

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:50,630
requests requested well we found out

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:54,980
that the cell provider does not allow

00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,660
any UDP out we tried it on various

00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,670
different ports and we were just weren't

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,200
getting anywhere we were seeing actually

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:06,340
we were seeing the packets getting there

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,340
but it wasn't allowing them back in so

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:15,160
even right 53 we tried to tunnel over

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,690
the DNS port which is often open but

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,640
they have that redirected to their own

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:27,440
name server so we weren't able to do

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:32,960
that we did get it working on TCP port

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:35,690
443 which is your HTTPS port which is

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,030
about the most common alternative for

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:42,140
people like us who are forced to do the

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:45,410
bad thing and tunnel over TCP what it's

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:50,170
working now so right now sprint thinks

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:53,360
bank of america has moved to omni city

00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:55,460
because there's a crapload of 443

00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,560
traffic passing over that network right

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:05,740
now i mean you couldn't get it with two

00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,740
pickup trucks it's but uh

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:14,710
so let me collect my thoughts because

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,300
like we said you know we wanted to do

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,450
the presentations and have the slides

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,400
and config files and all that jump but

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:28,330
until about 30 minutes ago they weren't

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:30,720
even you know solid so anyhow once we

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:34,090
got the tunnel up what we had to do was

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,670
connect my laptop up to the server here

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:40,750
and do a sourcing at a masquerade

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,630
iptables you know network address

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,690
translation so that the server could go

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:49,210
out over that and we had to do that over

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,920
the ton zero interface which is the the

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,510
virtual interface that gets created for

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,940
the VPN and then we had to figure out

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,580
some way to route the public over that

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,520
and the vendors and staff over the other

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:08,830
so we don't completely saturate you know

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,510
just the 4g wireless because i mean we

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:16,059
only have limited bandwidth either way

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:18,670
you know and robbie and rob all they

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,590
come up with some some nice custom route

00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,809
tables with you no additional right

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:26,320
tables and i was a little bit above my

00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:31,990
head i won't lie to you and if it's

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:34,120
above well I'm short so never mind but

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,800
once we got that took care of you know

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,330
things started passing and then squid

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,480
just up and died on us for no particular

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:43,840
reason and we still haven't gotten that

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,200
straightened out so there's no web cache

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,280
you know if you hit a web page we wanted

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,960
to be a first person to hit slashdot.org

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,880
cash it and then we don't have to go out

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,650
over the net we can just source it here

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,160
locally and then you know update every

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,770
15-20 minutes whatever but that's no

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,190
good so please try and be a little

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,410
conservative with that 4G because it's

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,960
actually Jeremy's phone and I'm not

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,800
entirely sure well screw him use it to

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,800
your heart's desire

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:25,020
do you have a question in the back saw

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:26,790
your hand up earlier questions how many

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,990
hours of sleep we've had in the past few

00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:32,610
days you know I don't know we had that

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,770
first night I meant to mention that

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:38,460
thank you that first night we all turned

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,920
in about four in the morning and of

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,050
course the conference started at nine

00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,730
friday morning so you can do the math

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:49,620
there there were about three maybe four

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,880
at the most last night for those of you

00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,470
that hung around the bar ladies you

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,700
noticed we didn't go into around two

00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:02,610
then the conference started to get it

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:05,700
done so okay I didn't get here at nine

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,309
this morning I think and you know I

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,280
don't know probably averaging five or

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:13,740
six hours we're doing okay we're nerds

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,809
we don't use much sleep as a normal

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:23,900
population right I just want to add a

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,900
caveat to that question David snores

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:35,190
would you like to respond I'm not in the

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,250
room with him but allen also snores I am

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,740
in the room with Rob and Rob snores and

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:48,059
growls and snorts and all sorts of other

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:49,679
stuff no lie at the last self afterwards

00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,840
you know I stay in a motel when I work

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:57,390
up in Atlanta because I don't live in

00:26:51,840 --> 00:27:00,150
Atlanta because I got sins and I let I

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,470
let Rob out here and Robbie stay with me

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,010
one night so they wouldn't have to drive

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:09,630
the whole way through and I think we

00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:11,340
turned in about midnight that night one

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,160
o'clock in the morning this sumbitch is

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,200
snoring wakes me up and I can't go back

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,640
to sleep so I went to work that morning

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,640
at one-thirty

00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:32,900
and still couldn't sleep because it was

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:34,310
ringing in my ears but uh yeah that's

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,900
neither here nor there we should

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,900
probably get back on topic shittin we

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,130
yeah y'all want the topic you want this

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:51,410
stuff so the question was did you want

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:55,420
the topic or do you want this stuff okay

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,420
I have one this is funny keep going oh

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,580
that's a good question do we have a

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,940
phone number for time warner that we can

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,970
I do not have a phone number for Time

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,970
Warner

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:41,370
he's been wanting to do that since

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:42,960
yesterday okay so he wants us to tell

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,690
you about the access points we like so

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,870
much we've actually got two different

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:51,690
ones or both engadget and I tell you

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,490
what that's such an easy question my

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,380
chauffeur just walked in the back there

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,270
in that plaid shirt I'm going to ask him

00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:09,930
to come up here and answer that question

00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:13,740
for me those were ingenious ap's by the

00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:14,820
way not in gadget but kevin was so kind

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,050
to bring those to us and they're

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,760
wonderful all I didn't tell you though

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,760
by those all right what's the question

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,830
yeah they're ingenious I've got them

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,330
deployed in a number of places I've got

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,860
one facility they make indoor and

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:40,410
outdoor grade access points um I've got

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,200
a couple facilities 80 acres plus that

00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,630
I've got covered with those things they

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,980
lay to do multiple ssids unifor ssi to

00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:51,630
ease / / access point of vlans leaving

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,550
me set up as routers client bridge he's

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:59,720
got a whisk you can actually set those

00:29:53,550 --> 00:30:01,710
up to to pull that in not only what else

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:11,450
they're typically less than hundred

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:14,630
bucks apiece 2929 yeah yeah they're uh

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,070
I've got a couple of facilities I've got

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:20,640
links that are about three quarters of a

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,250
mile found them on a couple of water

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,490
tanks actually broadcasting doing data

00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:30,180
back call for its a water meter systems

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:34,370
work very well very stable there's one

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:38,190
report the I think it's a 26 11 model in

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:41,130
Texas they built to 300 foot towers 20

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,710
miles apart and with just the standard

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,380
and

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,880
they got a link and they're using that

00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,620
as a twenty-mile link with those things

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:53,200
some of their they're pretty pretty

00:30:47,620 --> 00:31:03,730
strong thank you 20 miles in Texas

00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:05,649
that's line of sight right the question

00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:23,909
was what's the platform they run on and

00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:23,909
it is something bootloaders red boot

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,260
okay so it's a debian base with some

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:43,630
busybox junker apparently we can't

00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:45,100
confirm that one hundred percent we

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,909
should we should call them and ask for

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:52,659
the source code and if they're in Taiwan

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:54,010
is probably not going to happen they'll

00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:59,350
communicate with us about as well as

00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:01,860
Time Warner did too I think maybe

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,630
something else you were asking baby is a

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,830
there's only four for this this whole

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,350
area we've got covered there's one

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,350
where's the fifth I didn't place a fifth

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,899
okay I apologize 05 I only place for I

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,460
wasn't aware of the fifth one but this

00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:24,580
this whole area that's covered i mean

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,940
there's five aps and with some better

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:30,789
spacing you could cover a lot more area

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,080
but three of them are the standard what

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:34,779
you would think of when you think of an

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,490
AP two antennas on there two of them are

00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:39,580
the smoke detector styles and like you

00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm I'm kind of crazy about those I have

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,830
a feeling I'll be buying a couple of

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,049
those real soon now any other questions

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,419
and we're case is not clear we're kind

00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,659
of winging it at this point at this

00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,659
point

00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,049
what are we using for DNS Rob all this

00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:04,080
one's yours actually Alan is the one who

00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:09,029
set it up but we've just got done well I

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,210
fixed it yeah we've just got internal

00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:16,470
we've got a self dot land zone which is

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:21,860
all our forward names we have a separate

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:27,840
reverse zone for each of the what six

00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:31,470
subnets we've only five for the wireless

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,440
you set up six zones Oh didn't you 32-33

00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,960
3000 yeah yeah now this all could have

00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:45,840
been done in one zone but Alan does the

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:49,169
best he can but anyway it does work and

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,759
when you when your client requests a

00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:57,720
dhcp address the dhcp server tells the

00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:00,960
name server and your name is registered

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,970
in the self dot land and your IP address

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:12,389
will resolve to that name oh I'm sorry

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:16,280
it's ISC dhcpd and bind bind name d any

00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:20,669
other was that what you were asking okay

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:26,129
all right any other question I want to

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:28,500
thank Jeremy for nothing and the self

00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:31,230
staff have been really helpful all of

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,480
them have been really good to us the

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,510
hotel has done a good job I wish they

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,129
had some better infrastructure but you

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:43,169
can't really blame the current employees

00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:46,280
for that and again thanks to kevin and

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,280
thank you all

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,500
yeah thanks to kind of clarify saan that

00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:29,170
let's let's just be honest we had no

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:35,660
friggin idea what we were getting into

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:38,030
the last year yeah in it and really i've

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,160
heard jeremy described 2009 the same way

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,320
you know 2009 southeast linux fest he

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,640
had no idea none of us really had any

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,890
idea what we're getting into that year

00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,250
and it's had worked out and that's kind

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:51,500
of where we were yesterday you know we

00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,360
had a lot of ideas in her head of how we

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,780
were going to do this but quite frankly

00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,710
our only experience with this conference

00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:03,200
was as attendees and speakers and so

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:05,210
last year I was kind of half joking when

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,970
I told Jeremy hey next year we'll take

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,950
care of the network stuff and then the

00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,110
next thing I noon this year was rolling

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:16,150
around and he says oh by the way I got

00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:20,810
all down to cover network stuff damn and

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,890
so yes yes and and so here we are so we

00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,430
really didn't know what we were getting

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,870
into or what we were going to have to

00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,390
work with and you know I told you the

00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:32,720
time warner story already so a bit of a

00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:34,670
fiasco there but this this was a big

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,120
learning experience for us and the

00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:40,270
biggest problem was we had all talked in

00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,740
case it's not clear we we all our

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:45,950
friends real life and online and so you

00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,170
know we all had have an IRC server on

00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,640
our one of our co load servers and so we

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,470
talked there and kind of had a game plan

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,120
for what we wanted to do without

00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,070
specifics of course but we knew what we

00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,670
wanted to do and then we get here and

00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,070
all that's gone to hell in a handbasket

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,960
so all pretty much all of this was

00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:08,030
improvised it was ok so we can't do that

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,560
so now what um and so I guess where I'm

00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,980
going all this I said a lot of words to

00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,400
say this I apologize for this not being

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,690
exactly what we hoped it would be

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,910
although I hope you can at least agree

00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:23,900
that we made the best of what we had and

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,250
so you know if not then file complaints

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,990
with Jeremy and he can find somebody

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:35,750
else to the network next year he might

00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:37,550
have to anyway it's a valid point any

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,890
other questions comments random thoughts

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:43,940
he might walk to anyway no there's that

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:45,800
yes sir oh definitely question was did

00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,550
we have fun and the answer is certainly

00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,370
we were having fun still did you have

00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:59,170
fun nice if you guys are enjoying it

00:37:52,370 --> 00:38:02,450
that's what really matters any others no

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,920
okay well that's great we're going to go

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:13,480
find a beer store and buy some more for

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:13,480
this evening how do you turn this off

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:29,450
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,609
way to better utilize all your resources

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:35,060
and it makes managing all your resources

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:38,890
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:42,380
happening in open source the

00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:44,210
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,310
of the community and the speed at which

00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:48,319
these are these you know these these

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,630
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:53,210
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,940
that really shows the power of the you

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,560
know of the open source community it is

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,760
global and it's definitely because of

00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:04,130
the users community people are extremely

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:09,349
friendly and they're always ready to

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:10,849
help if you go on tire see any day

00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:13,160
you'll see these guys helping each other

00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:15,500
out and they're all doing it like in a

00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,390
selfless manner the product is

00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,170
transparent for everyone everyone can

00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:23,630
look at the code base everyone can see

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,240
how close darkest is being built nothing

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:31,339
nothing is proprietary everything is

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:36,829
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:40,700
to the the ongoing health CloudStack the

00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:44,599
most exciting event in recent memory for

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:47,540
me was our first developer boot camp and

00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:51,020
our call gave people I gave me two weeks

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:55,190
notice to come attend I was expecting 25

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:59,329
or 30 people so we ended up with 87

00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:01,670
people and had to go get more chairs in

00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:04,550
the room twice everything within cloud

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:07,040
computing is commodity and is open

00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:09,859
source and so I don't think that you

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,630
will you'll see anywhere where open

00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:14,660
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:17,359
computing and so i think it's i think

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,710
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,849
about cloud computing you're really

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,450
talking about open source cloud

00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:22,450
computing

00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,539
cloudstack is a robust solution for

00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:30,939
large deployments you have dozens of

00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:34,839
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:37,509
each data centers these hardware is

00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:40,989
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:43,689
to handle number one that mass scale

00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:46,869
number two it's designed to handle the

00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:49,749
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:53,920
deployments started working on contact

00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:57,189
over four years ago and it was the

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,989
original set of people working on it had

00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:03,069
a background of delivering software

00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:07,329
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:10,929
lots of users actually using it high

00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:14,019
availability is a key feature multiple

00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:16,179
hypervisors support different network

00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:19,209
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:20,979
better while step management server can

00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:24,670
be deployed in different physical

00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:26,319
machines it definitely has a huge

00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:31,299
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,880
there's a major movie studio that they

00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:37,179
were using CloudStack they were using it

00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,160
to transcode video and I thought that

00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:40,809
was terribly fascinating what I found

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,079
more fascinating is what they did during

00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:46,869
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,249
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,170
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:54,309
the instances and go back to doing real

00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:55,630
work CloudStack is vast it touches so

00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:57,699
many different aspects and there's no

00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,069
one person that's kind of like a master

00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:04,150
of all those realms I think cloudstack

00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:06,519
as a project is going to be one of the

00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:10,479
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:13,949
most feature fallen and and robust

00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:13,949
platforms out there

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,800
I don't see your limits of the clouds

00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,800
tag

00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,680
you

00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:42,069
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,049
ago we could not have imagined that

00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:46,240
asterisk would not only become the most

00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:48,369
widely adopted open source communication

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,410
software on the planet but that it would

00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:52,930
impact the entire industry in the way

00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,910
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,549
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,500
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:01,599
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,009
transition of power from the hands of

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,289
the traditional proprietary phone

00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:07,660
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:09,609
administrators of phone systems using

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,839
this power our customers have created

00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,789
all sorts of business changing

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,619
applications from small office phone

00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:17,140
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:18,759
the international carrier networks in

00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,529
fact there's even an entire country

00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:23,140
those communications of a structure runs

00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:25,059
on esters the gym has always been about

00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,769
creating technology that expands

00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,930
communications capabilities in ways that

00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:30,309
we could never have imagined and that's

00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,950
part of what's game-changing about the

00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:35,410
gym today we're doing it again this time

00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,509
by introducing a new family of HD IP

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,789
phones that extends control of the user

00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:41,559
all the way to the desktop the launch of

00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:43,079
these new products represents the next

00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:45,700
phase indigenous history of innovation

00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,680
these are the first and only IP phones

00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,269
designed to fully leverage the power of

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,890
Astra's when we first discussed our

00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:52,690
expectations for building a family of

00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:54,849
phones for use with asterisk our

00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,589
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:58,210
the team to build the phones such that

00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:00,430
they were easy to install integrate

00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,259
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:04,839
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:06,460
that goal user feedback is validating

00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,589
that when it comes to operation with

00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,990
astro space systems including our own

00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:13,569
Switchvox based product these are the

00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:14,890
easiest to use best integrated most

00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:17,470
interoperable products on the market

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:19,470
today the digitally phones will

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,519
initially include three IP des hommes

00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:23,470
uniquely designed to complement any

00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,329
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:28,000
these phones are different for a number

00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:30,640
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,079
designed for use with esters secondly

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,690
we've made it really easy to

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,069
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,170
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:39,720
to access information inside of asterisk

00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,720
allowing tight coupling

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,680
between an application and the phone

00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,869
additionally we've created an

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,970
applications engine that allows users

00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:51,210
and developers to create and run their

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,980
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,930
done all of this at a very compelling

00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,609
price point at digium we're always

00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,710
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:01,290
the best value in business phone systems

00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,820
and also give them the power to create

00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,980
their own solutions or any

00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,720
communications challenge will continue

00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,130
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,170
Astra's cooler faster more

00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,940
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,490
asterisk and communications even easier

00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:17,990
and together we'll change the way the

00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,990
world communicates again

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,500
