linux fest visit w wh linux pc org the

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,350
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,480
the following diamond sponsors in 2012

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,480
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,080
great can you hear me all right this is

00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,250
called protect this house Queen City

00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,410
crown there are a couple parts of this

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,840
presentation I'm going to go over a

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,180
little bit about the collegiate cyber

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,790
defense competition a national and

00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,860
regional competition where UNC Charlotte

00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,810
competes in yearly I'm going to talk a

00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,150
little bit about leadership how it

00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,199
relates to computer security and some

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,150
great stuff that happens during the

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,280
conference and halfway through I'm going

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,070
to hand it over to our linux admin

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,950
Daniel Coulson to go over how you

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,310
leverage Linux in a defensive

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,350
competition and how to make it effective

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,510
so a little bit about me I'm a senior at

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,940
UNC Charlotte majoring in software and

00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,410
information systems i run the computer

00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,110
security and ethical hacking club a

00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:32,440
volunteer here in charlotte on the ISS a

00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:36,250
board I'm a sysadmin in charlotte north

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,150
carolina a co-captain of the team the

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,580
competition team that you're going to

00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,350
see here is talk about today just

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,260
finished up a internship with Microsoft

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,880
and do a lot I'm a windows admin so i

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,990
hope none of you guys hold that against

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,520
me here but our entire team comes from

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,990
the club that we have at UNC Charlotte

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,450
it's our computer security ethical

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,520
hacking club started in 2009 by eight or

00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,620
nine kids who just wanted more out of

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,480
their classes as far as hacking and

00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,370
computer security went now we have over

00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,140
a hundred members and where the flagship

00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,610
organization of our college we have the

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,930
highest GPAs we were nominated for

00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,470
student organization of the year last

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,480
year we handle anything from academics

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,540
to social life to competition teams and

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,570
we feed into not only federal agencies

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,930
all over but also corporate environments

00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:26,110
so we've pretty much everywhere now the

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,489
competition is pretty much build as one

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,370
of the most relevant computer security

00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:32,830
competitions out there today this is not

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,700
like your traditional I CTF which is

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,500
what most of you are probably familiar

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,530
with this is a defensive base

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,239
competition where the goal is to provide

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,650
sort of a businesslike environment and

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,410
they say that it's a year of it's-- work

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,410
pretty much put into 72 hours straight

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:57,570
the teams here just talk a little bit

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,680
about how it's set up is we set up into

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:08,730
different regions just like any other

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:10,920
school Rebecca what okay essentially our

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,560
region is the southeast of course and we

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,030
traveled to Kennesaw Georgia every year

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,950
to compete in our regional qualifiers

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,450
when you walk in the room the teams all

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,450
have identical Network setups and

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,910
services are running they're essentially

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,020
green per se but they're barely working

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,940
they're essentially hanging by a thread

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,640
there's malware all over the network

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,980
things are terribly configured even some

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,240
years we have physical physical

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,640
vulnerabilities we have to find like a

00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,590
road access point in the room a ghost

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,690
keylogger of physical device installed

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,520
on the system and one near an ethernet

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,130
cable actually mirroring every single

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,170
packet of traffic we head out to the red

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,200
team so I'm sure that was useful for

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,310
them I'm glad we found it pretty quickly

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,870
we were scored in three different

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,330
categories throughout the scope of the

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,250
competition each category is worth 2,000

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,050
points the uptime and business

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,480
injections and i'll talk more about the

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,160
business injections later i'll start at

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,780
zero and there's 2,000 possible points

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,880
we can get out of each category the

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,859
defense we start with 2,000 points and

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,780
then every time we're hacked depending

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,330
on how we were hacked points are

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,610
subtracted from points are subtracted

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,740
from that as well the services we

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,110
maintain our shared on both windows and

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,460
linux systems we have a team members and

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,070
at the regional competition we are

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,240
against ten schools so it all sounds

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,640
pretty straightforward except there's

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,680
catch in fact there's lots of catches

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,919
we're behind a proxy to internet service

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,530
we get no sites or any outside access to

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,760
Google or anything like that except for

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,140
written requests so before the

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,120
competition during the competition we

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,960
request things like operating system to

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,400
updates like a bunch of repositories

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,590
microsoft windows update download com

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,030
essentially any resources we need have

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,550
to be approved and we have to justify

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,490
that

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,930
the red team is incredible I'm not going

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,520
to do any name dropping up here but

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,960
these are professional penetration

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,050
testers from all over the country and

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,280
actually all over the world and

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,710
essentially one we have about one hour

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,330
to get our ducks in a row and come up

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,729
with some sort of recovery plan before

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,849
the red team relentlessly start tacking

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:25,349
us and doesn't stop until 48 hours later

00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:27,030
nothing is out of scope for them they're

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,879
allowed to social engineer as they

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,370
deduced us for a while they inject

00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,110
malware on systems completely deleting

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,030
systems we'll go over a lot more what

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,349
they've done later but they are they are

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,650
intense and they are there to win as

00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,500
well the thing I think that separates

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,849
this competition from other computer

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,949
security competitions are the business

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,630
injections they are quick they're fast

00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,770
they are all day long and we never get a

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,840
break from them these are things that

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,819
you see in your everyday job assuming

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,030
that your systems administrator stuff

00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,979
like implementing VPNs DNS SEC wireless

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,159
networking keeping track of change logs

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,620
etc etc even security assessments our

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:07,710
own network and you know the way we

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,990
respond to them is importantly crucial

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,090
is very important to the competition so

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,310
it's not just about we need you to set

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,960
this up display your technical ability

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,360
and let's go on from there we actually

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,719
have to respond with memos to the CIO

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,039
CEOs and say we have this setup or we're

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:25,289
not setting this up this is a better

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,300
idea this is more secure have a user

00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,580
combined get their credentials so we are

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,729
essentially running an IT company for a

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,759
couple days sea level execs are pricks

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,580
to elaborate on that the people that run

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,139
the competition are incredible and they

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,849
put a lot of work into it however during

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,150
the competition they are in character as

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:48,300
a CEO or CIO and they are there to

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,710
frustrate us and distract us from every

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,409
possible thing that you can they're

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,330
there to scrutinize us and they're there

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:56,759
to make sure that we are competing at

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,909
the level that we should be on top of

00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,130
that a lot of the technology we're using

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,719
is very outdated some stuff I've never

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,009
even seen before someone's broken it

00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,229
doesn't even work in the first place I

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,300
didn't even know what BBS was until this

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:11,759
past competition apparently it's pretty

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,810
hard to lock down same as server 2000 I

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,070
don't know how anyone would protect

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,590
against that but

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,530
I did not have a good time we have

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,110
Juniper's up there so usually we get a

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,630
network topology beforehand one of our

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,670
younger students we thought we were

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,740
getting a cisco a SI to monitor network

00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,090
traffic and block against stuff so he

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,860
spent about four weeks learning

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,440
everything you possibly could about a SI

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,100
and then we show up and it's a juniper

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,040
firewall so he starts to learn Jupiter

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,950
Jupiter as quick as he could but that

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,510
was pretty frustrating like I was going

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,190
over earlier this is all about our

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,310
response to things we have to be

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,930
professional this is not a rack insec

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,160
kind of hacking competition where you're

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,160
throwing everything you can to something

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,680
this is a lot based on what you see in a

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,360
business environment so we have to

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,490
document everything we do this is either

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,720
through change logs and documentation we

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,080
actually have an entire person dedicated

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,230
only to doing paperwork whether it's the

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,570
red team or the White team or even at CC

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,740
CDC the power completely shutting off

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,100
during the competition for a couple

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,530
hours distractions are constant this

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,120
includes them saying memos where your

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,160
team captain is sick and has to leave

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,990
the room for an hour having to go to

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,430
meetings red team running in your room

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,550
and taunting you and making you feel

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,320
infinitely small doing paperwork

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,910
documentation all of that is a

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,090
distraction for what we're doing

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,669
technically during the competition on

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,320
the national level these are the nine

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:47,520
ten regional winners compete and these

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,980
are nine of them here there's nine we're

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,920
missing one Thank You person I asked to

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,480
say that we'll go over that a minute is

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,890
anybody alumni from these school we got

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,320
air force academy Alaska Fairbanks RIT

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:03,810
we have any alumni good we don't like

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,740
those people the tenth regional winner

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,960
is of course us UNC Charlotte at the SEC

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,480
CDC this year we're awarded first place

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,570
and not only that we rewarded the best

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,800
in defense and best and uptime this is

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,050
my favorite picture from the competition

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,850
tweeted by the director for anyone that

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,020
note this is nauseas and overlay

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,030
checking on the services that we

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,380
maintain during the competition that

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,870
ranges from everything from Active

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,650
Directory DNS multiple linux web

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,260
ecommerce so this is monitoring our

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,640
services red is obviously a bad thing if

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,470
you'll notice the top right is the only

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,060
one that's completely green that's the

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,300
end of the competition and that is UNC

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,680
Charlotte the rest of those people I've

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,190
gotten pretty well hacked it looks like

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,250
so this is the topology that we deal

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,660
with during the competition we have

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,460
workstations just like you would in a

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,320
corporate environment some of them

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,860
running windows XP some of them Vista

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:03,240
some of them seven some of them windows

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,070
2000 and we maintain multiple services

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,710
we have a website running on Windows is

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,870
we have linux database mysql an

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,640
e-commerce server we have a linux

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,000
secondary dns at Windows Active

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,140
Directory dns dhcp server windows email

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,980
server as well this is what we are

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,160
charged to maintain during the

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,320
competition and we do it with a certain

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,910
structure for our team this is kind of a

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,070
breakdown of what we have for our eight

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,350
members we have a captain focusing on

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,270
business injects and all their

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,160
professional courtesies and CIO CSO

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,870
during the competition we have a

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,279
co-captain who happened this is me

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,250
happen to be the windows admin at the

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,650
time we have to win x admins a backup

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,890
windows person the memo someone

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:49,110
dedicated only to paperwork a network

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,630
person and a gopher basically to handle

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,330
anything and everything that we don't

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,300
have time to do during the competition

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,100
so with that being said we've kind of

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,810
tailored this presentation to meet the

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,770
southeast Linux best and I'd like to

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:07,410
introduce our linux admin Daniel Coulson

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,910
he's 19 years old kind of like half of

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,250
our team we have a very young team right

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,510
now he's a incredible asset we have and

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,520
he's going to talk for about 15 to 20

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,670
minutes on how linux is used during the

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:22,410
competition successes failures working

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:25,339
with weird technology so Daniel yeah

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,339
yeah

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:43,540
okay so first we talked about the Linux

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:45,580
business injections and we had various

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,100
things like setting up a intrusion

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,310
detection system setting up an ftp

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,230
server which was a trick question we

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,080
were expected to push back on that since

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,920
ftp is not secure we instead set up an

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,420
SFTP sis for them we also had to add or

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,250
remove users from the systems or

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:09,160
websites one point we even had to set up

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,040
a honeypot unfortunately we didn't know

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,170
how to set it up at the time and didn't

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,760
have time to learn it so ended end up

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,260
grabbing all the IP addresses on the

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
network temporarily until we took it

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,140
back down needless to say that took down

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,750
all our services so and all these word

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,520
directives from the CIO as memos and

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:32,530
they're continuously coming in this is

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,150
just a small sampling some differences

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,589
between the regional and national level

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:41,140
competitions at regionals we only had

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:45,430
two Linux workstations and three Linux

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:47,230
servers and to Linux Edmonds so not too

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,760
much there we just took care of a

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,589
workstation and kind of shared the

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,660
servers at nationals we had a very large

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:58,540
network for to Linux admins at least

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:04,420
there were two Linux laptops eight

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:07,320
servers the so this was quite a bit more

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:11,260
than we could reasonably handle and

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,750
there were more exotic local attacks

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,740
once they got in they would do but more

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,860
back doors on get trickier local things

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,430
that we couldn't find lots of remote

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,380
attacks they're hard feet and there were

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,680
some of that and regionals as well but

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,710
compared to Nationals regionals was a

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,180
little easier they're definitely not

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:40,180
easy business injections were get more

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,190
difficult at nationals but there's

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,180
approximately the same amount

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,650
within periods of time some

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,440
misconfigurations we encounter when we

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,780
walked in the room are we had a gun to

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,030
box which was set with very low

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,010
resolutions probably about 800 x 600 or

00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,800
maybe lower if they very hard to read

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,410
font Luke our other linux admin worked

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:06,100
on that I don't know quite how he did

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:09,130
that the are you boom to box failed

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,890
after a district dist upgrade it was

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:17,010
version 8.2 for so we wanted to upgrade

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:20,080
that and after it rebooted it failed so

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,440
we eventually had to download with

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,450
unetbootin a live USB boot from that

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,430
that was the workstation I was working

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,200
on however it didn't have the correct

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,910
graphics drivers so I was using the

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,690
command line the entire time no GUI

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,490
there was default passwords on

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,960
everything from the workstations the

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,670
servers even the router there was a

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,000
publicly accessible PHP my admin page

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:49,060
again default password there unhelpful

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,860
command aliases things like CD command

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,570
or alias to shut down dash H now so as

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,040
soon as you tried to go anywhere the

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:00,280
system to shut down unless you notice

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,210
that first and sometimes they had even

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,160
made backups of the those aliases so if

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,590
you remove the alias that you saw first

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,110
it would be another one included in the

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:16,900
batch RC file so we would come back

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:20,710
keyloggers Linux keylogger lkl was there

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:24,610
occasionally there were others that we

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:27,480
simply couldn't find but and there are

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,480
no firewalls in anything

00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,519
Red Team some of the things they did to

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:36,629
us web server brute-forcing we figured

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,889
they were using a tool like dirt Buster

00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:42,329
to just draw our brute force pass on the

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,519
web server see if anything was open that

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:46,439
way they could get to one saw when they

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,689
got in on an unpatched system we hadn't

00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:51,269
had time to patch yet they added their

00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:52,889
own SSH keys so even if we had changed

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,949
the passwords and stuff locked it down

00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:58,170
they could still got in that box

00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:00,600
actually was repeatedly hacked they kept

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,399
changing their password and stuff so we

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,660
eventually just took it down went

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,819
through it and found those SSH keys they

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,939
also as that convention they D Doss the

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:15,089
web server with H ping 3 he's an S one

00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:16,589
packet flood from randomized IP

00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,209
addresses so we couldn't just say oh

00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,050
this is the IP addresses coming in on

00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:24,240
block so what we did there actually well

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,999
as we read a script to look through

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,040
netstat pull out the IP addresses that

00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:31,410
were flooding us with vesa mahan packets

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,100
and dynamically add iptables firewall

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,959
rules to that and surprisingly it worked

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,980
and we were actually the only team

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,759
successfully defeated that they as I

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,639
mentioned they changed the root

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,420
passwords once they get in they would

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,799
change things shut down services and

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,009
change your passwords which we'd have to

00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,660
take systems down to single user mode

00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:59,220
change the root password back and figure

00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,779
out how they got in da on virtual

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,250
machines we could occasionally reese nap

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:07,559
shot them back PHP web back back doors

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,659
and web shells on the web server some of

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,829
these were helpfully names backdoor PHP

00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:18,659
and things like that some of them were

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:20,939
not so obvious also wore red team they

00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:23,659
ran an RM dash RF on our entire web

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:27,360
server and took the whole thing down

00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:29,730
fortunately we did have a image from the

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,830
beginning the competition and eventually

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,809
we were able to put that back on there

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,309
this is not a virtual machine by the way

00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:39,990
so we couldn't just reach snapshot it

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:42,470
probably my favorite and least favorite

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:47,000
of course thing they did was in

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:49,309
BR virus so once they got in and we saw

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,169
a script going that quickly download an

00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,530
executable about 10 seconds layered

00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:57,260
system rebooted and the master boot

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,110
record had been overwritten and edge so

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,120
that when displayed it would say I'm

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,340
display the message this box has been

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,419
pwned by mukki please contact best by

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:10,429
technical support for assistance so I

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:12,380
look quite interesting fortunately that

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:16,159
was a virtual machine we able to restock

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:18,260
shot it back and try to fix it they

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,820
dumped our MySQL databases we had

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,650
customer databases that we were supposed

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,809
to protect and when didn't always this

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,340
was again every day they were able to

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,289
get in sometimes before you're able to

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,940
patch the systems for example in the

00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:35,840
regional competition where we had a

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,580
proxy server there come the Debian

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,679
security updates were not in the list

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:44,390
and we were not able to get those until

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,340
the second day so they also at nationals

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,320
again there was a lot of stuff at

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:54,020
nationals that was more exotic sort of

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,190
no he had never seen before none of our

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,789
team really had any experience at

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:02,510
nationals before so they had infected

00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:05,870
system services we never found any of

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,789
these but they apparently had infected

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,630
some of the system services so something

00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:14,210
that was valid valid service running was

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,700
itself infected and so there were no

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,330
random executables lying around cron

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:24,950
jobs etc they're using that they

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:27,919
replaced system executables chmod chn

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:31,299
things like that and replace those with

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,409
their own malicious versions they would

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:36,679
this is another interesting trick they

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:39,169
would add users to etsy passivity then

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,230
set the immutable bit and delete the

00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:44,090
change attribute executable so we

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,559
couldn't change it back we had to

00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,570
eventually find that package and

00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,820
reinstall that so we could remove the

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,809
immutable bit and remove those people

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,670
and on our solaris mail server they

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,160
executed a fork bomb

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:04,700
which continuously spawned hundreds of

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:07,220
bash shells so so what we did for our

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,350
defense we used very long pass phrases

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,800
20 to 25 characters something like that

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:15,020
and near the beginning we occasionally

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,720
use the temporary human IDs there's

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,770
people watching that staff for income in

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,950
ssh connection and stuff that shouldn't

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,660
be there database permissions we would

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,180
go in and change the passwords on

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,580
everything there including the MySQL

00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,290
databases and try to restrict some of

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,330
the permissions on the database so that

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:36,350
if they dig it in they wouldn't be able

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:39,280
to do a lot I'd be tables firewall this

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:41,210
was interesting before the competition

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,940
we had printed off some reference

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,080
manuals and stuff for iptables common

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,220
commands and stuff we figured we need

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,990
and it was enough we did not know

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,620
iptables good enough and we had to join

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,480
it very fast so we will be using we know

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,600
iptables better now we will also be

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,020
using ufw to help with firewall rules

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,790
next time as well and of course we

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:12,140
perform security updates one way to got

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:14,990
them more defense again the script that

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,900
dynamically adds iptables rules to

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,760
defeat the sy n flood and another

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,160
helpful tool we wrote on the fly there a

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,440
small system monitoring script that

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,710
would look through apache logs VAR log

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,460
messages database logs whatever was on

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,290
relevant on that server and display that

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,780
on the screen a refreshed every five

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:39,470
seconds it also showed incoming netstat

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:42,560
connections like ssh so that was part of

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,390
our human IDs there that was very

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,460
helpful and toward the end of the

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,040
competition when we did get our firewall

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,570
rules good they weren't getting through

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,800
anymore and we were kept saying failed

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,800
SSH logins on there

00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,070
so recovering from attack this is the

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,290
method we used when we discovered a

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,460
system has been compromised and we

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,160
really started doing this regionals

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,030
after that server with the ssh keys on

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,870
it have been broken into repeatedly and

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,680
since we're able to do the security

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,720
updates that's probably how they got in

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,240
so first have their figure out how they

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,740
got in we just kept going through Paso

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:26,760
PD and running RK hunter my new favorite

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,460
tool check we finally check the ssh

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,250
authorized keys and found their extra

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,970
keys figure out what they did when they

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:37,830
got in so I can step there find the ssh

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,980
keys third thing fixed what they did

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,960
patch the hole we'd had we remove the

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,700
keys made sure the firewall was an

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,980
operation which is also part of make

00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,960
sure they don't get in again so this is

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,360
the procedure we repeated on systems

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,120
when we couldn't or when they were

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,830
compromised and I think that's what

00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,830
really helped us at Regionals especially

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:05,070
how we could do better we'd dig good we

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,530
won regionals but we could definitely do

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,120
better there and at nationals iptables

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,130
and we didn't know the syntax very well

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,900
from the beginning multiple os's we had

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:22,260
had regionals there was some fairly

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:23,730
normal things there fedora open suse and

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,880
you get into things like it went to

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:30,600
things like that at nationals they had

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,950
all the all those as well as freebsd and

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,800
I think openbsd and Solaris so we didn't

00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,360
know solaris or bsd really well we knew

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,390
bsd good enough to put up a firewall

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,580
install packages or run are a hundred

00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,700
things like that weren't able to stop

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,700
the fork bomb on solaris though local

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,340
hacking prevention once they got in we

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,460
need a way to keep them from being able

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,640
to do too much so something like selinux

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,110
we didn't have time to get that up we're

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,850
possibly looking into things like gr

00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,250
security something doesn't have quite as

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,770
deep a learning curve database security

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,150
mention we tried to lock down databases

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,720
some and we could do a little bit of

00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,510
that

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,910
but we didn't know a lot of how to do

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,550
that we're also working on learning

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,490
methods of detecting and recovering from

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:23,640
attacks like we faced at nationals where

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,410
there's xq Buhl's malicious xq poles

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,720
embedded in the system services and

00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:31,110
where they replace executables of their

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,000
own the red team told us at the end that

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,400
within the first 10 minutes of Nationals

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,150
competition there they had at least five

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,210
back doors on all systems said we really

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:46,740
need to keep them from doing much since

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:50,280
they're already in there and when I said

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:54,840
we didn't have a lot of time during this

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,310
so if we wanted to set up an IDs then by

00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,520
the time we could have done it that

00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:04,650
would have been into everything and

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,730
ideas would have been moved then and

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,000
what we're working on for next time

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:14,370
quickly setting up those firewalls with

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,040
ufw or a pre pre worked out firewall

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:20,850
script with iptables learning multiple

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:24,900
os's cross-trained team members we only

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,970
again we only had two linux admins which

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,730
was fine for regionals but for nationals

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,320
we needed two and a half or three so

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,940
we're going to work on train cross train

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,250
some of the windows guys to work on

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:40,020
linux a little bit or even playing a

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:42,150
third linux guide and as linux guys can

00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,740
also do some things on windows as well

00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:49,530
if our as our team captain needs to step

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,540
out of the room because he's sick then

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:55,680
when one of us might have to step and

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:57,900
step up and do something their web and

00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:02,340
database permissions and we need to work

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:09,240
on securing SQL databases so I can't do

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:11,480
much if I get in and selinux and back to

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,480
the Mayo

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,649
alright so that's pretty much the scope

00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:29,190
of Linux and how to use during the

00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:32,529
competition although we had to NX admins

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,850
both of them were 18 19 years old so I

00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,230
think they did they definitely held

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,630
their own in a regional and national

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,299
level we're very very proud of the

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,639
accomplishments that they've had their

00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:44,980
this cut this uh this competition is

00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:47,799
designed to frustrate and overwhelm so a

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,470
lot of a lot of what we had to do there

00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,480
is work on our leadership and teamwork I

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,029
think this is something I want to go

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,559
over a little bit about kind of what we

00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,840
do there and a little why it's different

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,100
all of us obviously deal with this if

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,950
you work with other employees whether

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,220
you are the leader or just a part of the

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,110
team it's different with IT people I'm

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,260
the one of the classically leadership

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,110
trained sort of how people work together

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,330
in committees or small groups and what

00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,730
I've noticed is it doesn't work as well

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:21,370
or sometimes at all with people that are

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:24,309
very technology minded we are different

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:26,289
than most people and by that sense in

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,760
small groups the ways that we

00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:31,510
communicate in the ways that we're

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,389
inspired are different as well you know

00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:37,389
introverts maybe odd self-confidence or

00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:38,679
perhaps more self-confidence highly

00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,929
intelligent they require a different

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,120
kind of stimuli to keep entertained in

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:44,710
that kind of situation if I interviewed

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,779
everyone in this room and asked them

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,820
what a great leader was and what they

00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,960
saw in great leaders everyone would

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,299
obviously give me a different answer

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,130
there be a couple common a couple common

00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:56,380
answers between you all but everything

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,100
for the most part would in fact be a

00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,630
little different and by that respect a

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,950
different leader should be a different

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,830
leader to different members of the group

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:09,370
I think if you interviewed the team

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:12,519
members of a group they should say that

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,200
a good leader actually has that their

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,090
leader was in fact different people to

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,230
them depending on the situation and they

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,889
would all give a different opinion on

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,299
what they did that was most effective

00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:24,460
put up their technical ability is

00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:25,480
important respect is more important this

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,309
is sort of

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,110
way more relevant in sort of a

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,270
competition setting where we are

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,890
extremely overwhelmed and in the weeds

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,830
you need to be able to trust your leader

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,870
on a technical on a technical basis but

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,570
also sort of an organizational

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,190
standpoint to say everyone you know this

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,900
is what we need to do to get out of the

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,730
situation we all need to work together

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,520
and inspire each other to move through

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,080
the process I put the word a bunch of up

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,660
there and it's probably not what you're

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,610
thinking it is the amazing operating

00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,500
system that it is but a bunch of one of

00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,890
the translations for is actually I am

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,780
what I am because of who we all are and

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:04,049
it's very team-based setting I think

00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,460
it's important to keep remembering that

00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:07,570
you know I asked earlier if everyone to

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,490
say different qualities about what a

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,080
great leader would be but so why would

00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,970
you adopt the same style when dealing

00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,559
with different kinds of people every

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,000
single member of my team and I assume

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,760
your team responds differently to

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,470
different actions so by that merit I

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,660
think it's important that inspiration is

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,610
meant by different stimuli you know even

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,770
for example hearing me talk and hearing

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:29,380
mr. Colson talk for a certain amount of

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,530
time on our team you would influence us

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:35,700
differently and inspire us differently

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:38,049
for the complete effectiveness there I

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,880
think great teamwork comes from practice

00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:41,230
that's something that we have practiced

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,520
a lot everyone on the team has known

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,799
each other for years and that really

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,600
comes out in the competition setting if

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,730
you don't put any work towards becoming

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,320
a great team then you'll all just be a

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,299
lot of people working separately towards

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,130
the same goal and I don't think that's

00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:59,830
very effective but by the same merit we

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,970
did read one we did win regionals and we

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,710
didn't do as well as we do like at

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,570
Nationals but we will of course be back

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,429
next year hopefully with a vengeance but

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,530
that's not to say that we don't have a

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,720
little bit of humility as well so I'm

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,190
going to go over a little bit of some

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,750
sad and funny stories that we

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,070
experienced and that I think it will all

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,510
appreciate we talk a lot about how evil

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,120
the red team is and while we appreciate

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:24,160
the volunteering it was pretty rough

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,450
during the competition they would they

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,070
would make certain teams this didn't

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,350
happen to us at Nationals but that would

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,870
make them tweet a picture to picture to

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,760
national CCDC of all of them basically

00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,840
fake crying and if they did and they got

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,840
30 minutes without getting hacked

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,220
Daniel mentioned the best buy boot

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,690
sector a lot of the red team I think

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,910
we're writing non-cat to the boot sector

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,430
so instead of an operating system it's

00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:51,430
got a picture of the nine cat meme while

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,800
you were booting this was from two years

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,110
ago one of my favorites the red team was

00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,880
hacking and defacing websites except

00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,890
they still felt so bad for the team they

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,480
were attacking they actually deface it

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:05,680
with instructions on how to not let it

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:09,790
happen again I think they just wanted to

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,960
challenge a lot of times you know you're

00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,760
going through systems and I guess this

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,670
isn't more Linux related than windows of

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,840
something I've seen you know Red Team a

00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,820
lot of the time and this is more true at

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,040
Nationals when they're in a lot of them

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,810
yes we'll our mrf everything and shut

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,070
down and uninstalled dns and change

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,360
everything some of them don't do

00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,280
anything they just get a shell you know

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,590
if they retrieve personally identifiable

00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,790
information or if they retrieve

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,920
depending on what they were treated to

00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,440
get more points so you don't always get

00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,420
the most points as a red team from just

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,860
destroying everything so when I'm on a

00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,560
Windows system and I see notepad.exe

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:45,280
running with like I don't know a gig

00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,730
memory behind it pretty sure that's the

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,380
process I'm going to end immediately at

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,350
nationals actually I had a scheduled

00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,840
process running every minute to send a

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,370
shell back to the red team so and I

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,200
couldn't remove it because they changed

00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,870
any permission I'd ever have just like

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,160
the immutable file process I think so I

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,140
actually had to create a scheduled task

00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,600
that was triggered by that task to kill

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,610
the shell to give me even five minutes

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,360
of relaxation during the competition for

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:16,420
that particular windows2003 bucks human

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,890
/ remapping commands CD shut down one

00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,790
year actually open the CD drive so I

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:25,120
thought that was pretty clever see here

00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:28,960
47 I'm a sad panda that entire line is

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,000
part of one of our passwords this

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,630
happened the reason I put that on here

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,480
so during our DDoSing than our hazing

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,710
last year we're down and essentially one

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,060
of the directors the red team that we

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,830
knew and we had always talked to

00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,770
throughout the years runs in our room

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:47,590
and yells at us at panda i really i gots

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:50,170
a jerk whatever and he leaves and i

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,010
think our team captain a couple minutes

00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,240
later was like oh my

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:58,060
that's the root password to our

00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:00,520
intrusion detection system so yeah and

00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:04,240
that is a classic red team move I mean

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:07,840
it's happened before so essentially when

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,950
you get hacked at CCDC it's it's not of

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,900
course you've heard it's not if you're

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,730
going to get Hackett's win let's see CDC

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,990
it's not really wind it's all the time

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,880
so it's what you're going to do when it

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,230
happens so every time we get hacked if

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,030
we do an incident report and we do it

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:22,000
correctly we receive half the points

00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,920
back that happened for that attack so we

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,230
went through the logs and we looked for

00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,050
everything we could and we fill that an

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:32,470
interim report director of the hackers

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,940
you know came in and yelled our root

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,190
password to the entire team and then

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,860
left and we had no idea how they did it

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,090
we couldn't check anything so after the

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,790
competition I remember talking to him

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,140
and I went up to him I said so I found

00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,850
everything you know we found so much

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,950
that you did but we couldn't find IDs

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,630
ting how did you get our root password

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,550
because what are you talking about I

00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,410
said you yelled sad panda that was one

00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:56,290
of our passwords he goes no I just say

00:33:53,410 --> 00:34:01,180
sad panda all the time so it turned out

00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:02,860
to just be a complete coincidence so we

00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,650
quit using memes as passwords and have

00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,730
moved on to spongebob squarepants I'll

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:11,080
have to find something else for next

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,610
year hazmat suits as i have said

00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,770
multiple times this conference this

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,000
competition is MIT too overwhelmed

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,940
there's a lot of other things besides

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,250
technical proficiency going on the room

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,750
two years ago we walk in the room and

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,429
there's a box of hazmat suits in the

00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,990
back and they're actually just painter

00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,120
suits but they were built as hazmat

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,980
suits and I think they were built for a

00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,139
person that was about four feet tall so

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,120
I don't know where they got them but

00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,649
there was a lot of emergency response

00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,480
there was an emergency response plan

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,010
that we had to be ready for and read

00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,679
through the bullet the bulletins and

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,690
whatnot so at some point they ring an

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,909
alarm and apparently there's a hazardous

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,679
material spill in our building I guess

00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,629
it'd be a situation that you run into if

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,490
you worked at IT security at some high

00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,690
military base or whatever but you

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,960
essentially had a minute to put on your

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,360
hazmat suit and some of us that you know

00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,030
are not this big or we're having trouble

00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,950
with it so they'd if you didn't get your

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,060
hazmat suit on the time you more

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,190
infected and you have to leave

00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,350
room for an hour so that was one of my

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,030
darkest moments was being kicked out of

00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,040
the room where I had hours and hours of

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:16,240
work to do sitting outside in the rain

00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:20,950
alone in a hazmat suit that was pretty

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:24,340
depressing rdp battle of her active

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,420
directory so this is one time that was

00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,700
really thankful that the guy that was

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,930
hacking me was so good at Linux and so

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:33,370
terrible at windows he is a believed

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:37,210
before we had updates he did it pass the

00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:39,940
hash attack on my domain administrator

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,700
account and actually even before that

00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,350
when we were outside talking he he told

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,000
me that he had my domain admin account

00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,980
really he at least you then you knew the

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,080
username and he didn't even know my name

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,420
and he goes yeah what's that's what Zach

00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,460
admin and I was like oh my god so I had

00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,020
to change that up or a quick but at some

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,620
point he did it pass the hash attack on

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,570
my account and he locked me out of my

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,890
domain controller deleted any other

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,570
account for me to actually get into the

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,920
domain controller and then lock me out

00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,690
of my workstation that I was working on

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,250
to access that I'm a controller in the

00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,590
first place so I essentially have to

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,730
hack back into my own workstation and it

00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,490
takes a couple minutes for me to

00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,470
basically get in with an account that's

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,910
not a domain admin and escalate my

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,350
privileges up to where I can see what

00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,000
he's doing finally you were going to

00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,490
control my own account and he's sitting

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,600
there not using Active Directory how

00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,840
you're supposed to and trying to

00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,360
uninstall DNS so his uh his not knowing

00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,590
how to shut now my domain bought me a

00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,450
couple minutes for me to hack my way

00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:38,110
back in before he destroyed my entire

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:40,180
network why are we yelling at each other

00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,790
this is just something silly you know

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,230
when a lot of communication and this

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,540
goes into the next point to where not to

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,280
put software the memo guy is one of

00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,260
those underappreciated people during the

00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,270
competition you cannot win you cannot

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,860
even compete without doing paperwork so

00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,630
the memo guy it's important to

00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,620
communicate with him at all times so

00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,630
what we're trying to do during the

00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,780
competition is document what we're doing

00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,790
and he's working on either remediation

00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,230
from us getting hacked or he's working

00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:08,440
on change logs or he's working on a

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,210
business injection response so I'm

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,140
yelling at him at one point and we

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,340
realize we're talking about the same

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,430
thing and there's no reason to yell at

00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,539
each other but the we're not to put

00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,209
software

00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:23,199
the cio of the competition who of course

00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:27,249
is in character as you know a hard-ass

00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,569
at the time comes in our room and he

00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:30,609
goes team captain come down here now

00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,019
stop everything so you know you kind of

00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:36,069
walk down there tail between your legs

00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:37,390
and he he told me I don't know where

00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:40,029
you're putting software but you need to

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,529
quit you just stop it right now and he

00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:45,249
hands me a memo that we wrote which was

00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:46,599
a URL request and apparently our memo

00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,890
guy at the time was a very proficient

00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,179
with Linux because when I read it it

00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:55,749
says we would like to request the

00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:58,179
ambassadors for updates so not

00:37:55,749 --> 00:38:00,549
repositories but so far the tories so

00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:01,630
clearly we have rectified that in every

00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:05,019
sense of the word since that happened

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:06,579
but that was pretty challenging and we

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,900
got haze for that they used to make us

00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:10,509
wear cheese heads when we do something

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,999
stupid and take a picture they're all

00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:14,589
about the hazing there but that's that's

00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:17,499
all we've got for now that's some of the

00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:20,410
some of the humor we use to try to keep

00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:23,380
saying during the competition we would

00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:25,900
love any of you guys to come volunteer

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,729
or come hackus and our test networks or

00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,959
offer any kind of training obviously

00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:32,319
we're nonprofit we're an organization

00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:34,779
university or within the university

00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:37,449
rather so any kind of contact or any

00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:39,549
support any feedback would be absolutely

00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:42,249
fantastic or if you just want to stay in

00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:43,479
touch here's my contact information does

00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:46,169
anybody have any questions I think we

00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:46,169
have a little bit of time left

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:58,220
yes so one of the curveballs that they

00:38:55,049 --> 00:39:00,809
owe he asked if they were you that the

00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,280
he said these VoIP systems at Nationals

00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:04,440
and asked if we had encountered that we

00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,349
had and there were a couple of teams

00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,700
they got hacked through that we did not

00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:10,380
although you know I said that we were

00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,700
scored on three categories at Regionals

00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,170
the fourth category that they added

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,960
Nationals this year was essentially

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,569
customer service so we had an orange

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,609
team essentially our customers we were

00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:22,049
running their websites calling up pretty

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:25,819
much prank calling us every hour and

00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:27,690
distracting us as well there's a meme

00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:29,640
online I'd encourage you to look at

00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,410
called blue team bird which essentially

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,089
is all the stupid stuff that happens to

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,280
the blue team and mistakes they made and

00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:37,859
one of one of them and I don't know

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,660
which team it was but apparently the red

00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,819
team had changed their caller ID to the

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,799
Black team which as far as I know is not

00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:45,900
a team at all and they were calling and

00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:49,319
asking for root passwords the systems

00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,000
the red team was calling them and going

00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:53,910
in through there but yeah we had a VoIP

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,099
system it was we never got hacked on it

00:39:53,910 --> 00:40:01,460
but I know a couple teams did any other

00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,460
questions

00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,349
I think Black team is built to you I saw

00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,730
one blue team bird that apparently the

00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:10,470
red team or the White team had a

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,550
quadcopter with like a camera on her or

00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,890
something they were flying into teams

00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,920
rooms apparently one of the kids try to

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:19,230
use in Cisco is a five of fifty five of

00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,109
five or whatever it's called to bat the

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,570
quadcopter out of the air so yeah they

00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:25,740
pretty much do everything they can to

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:29,730
distract you during that including

00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:31,589
aerial video surveillance so we had one

00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,220
year we I think I was the captain at

00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:37,650
this point we had someone in at kennesaw

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,210
we the competition happens the kennesaw

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,250
state georgia we had someone in a

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,920
kennesaw polo come up to us and say

00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,930
we're doing some blasting outside we

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,390
need to take pictures of your room so of

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,880
course we are on paranoid like DEFCON 5

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:53,550
alert level so I'm like absolutely not

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,349
get the hell out of here Red Team you

00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,300
know trying to see what we're doing and

00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:59,040
we even put an incident report and I

00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,450
asked one of the administrators the

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,130
competition later I'm like yeah that was

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,270
pretty sly and you're like no those

00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,270
people work there you probably should've

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:10,700
let him in the room but you know no harm

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:13,980
no foul I guess so any other questions

00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,270
all right well you know we're your

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,190
sports team if you can't count on the

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,830
Panthers hopefully count on us to do

00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,330
well for you and we appreciate you

00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:24,030
letting us come here and talking about

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:29,089
our successes and our failures and yeah

00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,089
it's great to be a part of it all right

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,819
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,010
way to better utilize all your resources

00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:26,460
and it makes managing all your resources

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:30,289
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:33,809
happening in open source the

00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:35,609
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,710
of the community and the speed at which

00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:39,690
these are these you know these these

00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,000
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,849
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,849
that really shows the power of the of

00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:50,329
the open source community it is global

00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:53,849
and it's definitely because of the users

00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:59,490
community people are extremely friendly

00:42:53,849 --> 00:43:01,410
and they're always ready to help if you

00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,660
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,390
guys helping each other out and they're

00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,099
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:11,089
the product is transparent for everyone

00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:14,279
everyone can look at the code base

00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:16,520
everyone can see how close that is being

00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:22,020
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:24,660
everything is open in many ways it's

00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:29,099
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:33,299
health CloudStack the most exciting

00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:36,160
event in recent memory for me was our

00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:38,799
first developer boot camp

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,440
and our call gave people I gave me two

00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:45,400
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:49,630
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:52,420
with 87 people and had to go get board

00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,940
chairs in the room twice everything

00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:58,180
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:01,240
is open source and so I don't think that

00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:03,010
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,039
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,770
computing and so i think it's i think

00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:10,119
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,230
about cloud computing you're really

00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:16,780
talking about open source cloud

00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:19,809
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:21,940
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:26,230
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:28,900
in each data centers these hardware is

00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:32,380
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:35,079
to handle number one that mass scale

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:38,260
number two it's designed to handle the

00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,809
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:44,349
deployments started working on cog

00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:47,589
attack over four years ago and it was

00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:49,930
the original set of people working right

00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:53,069
I had a background of delivering

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:56,619
software telcos and service providers

00:44:53,069 --> 00:45:01,319
lots of QA lots of users actually using

00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:05,109
it high availability is a key feature

00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:07,059
multiple hypervisors support different

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,849
network models you can pick up whatever

00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:11,920
suits you better while step management

00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:15,640
server can be deployed in different

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,230
physical machines it definitely has a

00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,839
huge footprint it's being deployed

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:24,670
everywhere there's a major movie studio

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:28,240
that they were using cloudstack they

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:29,770
were using it to transcode video and i

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,750
thought that was terribly fascinating

00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,819
what i found more fascinating is what

00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:37,539
they did during lunch where they would

00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:39,010
spin up you know 50 or 60 game servers

00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:40,220
then as soon as lunch was over they

00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,340
would destroy all the essays

00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,740
isn't compactor doing a little work

00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,270
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,130
different aspects and there's no one

00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,770
person that's kind of like a master of

00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:55,550
all those realms I think clouds stack as

00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:57,800
a project is going to be one of the

00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:01,880
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:07,310
most feature fallen and and robust

00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:10,210
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,210
living through the clouds dag

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,090
you

00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,460
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,440
ago we could not have imagined that

00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,630
asterisk would not only become the most

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,790
widely adopted open source communication

00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,800
software on the planet but that it would

00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:44,320
impact the entire industry in the way

00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,300
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,940
way into more than 170 countries and

00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,890
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,960
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,400
transition of power from the hands of

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,680
the traditional proprietary phone

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,050
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,000
administrators of phone systems using

00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,230
this power our customers have created

00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,180
all sorts of business changing

00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,010
applications from small office phone

00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,560
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:10,150
the international carrier networks in

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,920
fact there's even an entire country

00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,320
those communications infrastructure runs

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,450
on esters the gym has always been about

00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,160
creating technology that expands

00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:20,350
communications capabilities in ways that

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,520
we could never have imagined and that's

00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,920
part of what's game-changing about

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,620
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,720
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,820
IP phones that extends control of the

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,590
user all the way to the desktop the

00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,300
launch of these new products represents

00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,400
the next phase in de jambes history of

00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,800
innovation these are the first and only

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,510
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,070
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,080
our expectations for building a family

00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,240
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,980
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,630
the team to build the phones such that

00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,820
they were easy to install integrate

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,680
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,230
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,850
that goal user feedback is validating

00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,980
that when it comes to operation with

00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:02,410
astro space systems including our own

00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,960
Switchvox based product these are the

00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,280
easiest to use best integrated most

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,860
interoperable products on the market

00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,870
today the digitally phones will

00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,910
initially include three IP desk phones

00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,860
uniquely designed to complement any

00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,720
asterisks or switch box based solution

00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,390
these phones are different for a number

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,060
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,470
designed for use with esters secondly

00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,930
we've made it really easy to

00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,490
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,170
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,130
to access information inside of

00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,130
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,090
between the application and the phone

00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,250
additionally we've created an

00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:39,380
applications engine that allows users

00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:42,620
and developers to create and run their

00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,390
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,340
done all of this at a very compelling

00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,020
price point at Digium we're always

00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,120
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,640
the best value in business phone systems

00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,230
and also give them the power to create

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,360
their own solutions or any

00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:58,100
communications challenge will continue

00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,510
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,580
astros cooler faster and more

00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,200
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,690
asterisk and what communications even

00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,370
easier and together we'll change the way

00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,370
