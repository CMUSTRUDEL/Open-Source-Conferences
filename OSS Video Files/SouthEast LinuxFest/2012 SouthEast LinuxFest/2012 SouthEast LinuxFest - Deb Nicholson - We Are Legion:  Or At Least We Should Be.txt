the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,330
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,630
possible welcome to southeast limits

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,050
fest 2012 for this session we have deb

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,700
nicholson she's a community manager from

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,980
media goblin she's going to tell us why

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,770
we are legion or at least we should be

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:50,070
right it's still on mute can people hear

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,899
me great okay so as my friend air

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,789
mentioned I'm the community manager at

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,579
media Goblin that's our project to build

00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,480
a decentralized media hosting framework

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,609
so instead of sort of a many-to-one

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,189
relationship we want to facilitate a

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,020
many-to-many relationship so I'm going

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,090
to talk about some of the earlier

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,680
examples of decentralization or

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,540
centralization that did or didn't work

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,060
and why and how those might have bearing

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,590
on what we're looking at with the web

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,080
now and then I'm going to go through

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,049
which tools have already been built and

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,240
what tools still need to be built to

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:27,390
build the you know the full suite of

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:33,000
decentralized media services or you know

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:36,630
social etc so let me see and do that

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,060
okay great tell me if the display gets

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:45,530
wonky so so this is the very first

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:49,979
machine that sent email this is from

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,649
1971 ray Tomlinson sent the first email

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,570
in whole world on ARPANET he's a guy

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,969
that's responsible for the @ symbol and

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,619
so at the beginning email didn't really

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,299
need to be decentralized because

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,360
everybody that you wanted to talk to is

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,619
probably in the same building so it

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,860
really didn't matter like whether it was

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,470
centralized or not and so eventually a

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,270
his initial framework was put on to

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,810
about 40 machines and so those were all

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,850
ARPANET employees so so we started with

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,250
like a very centralized single type of

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,160
thing but when email got a little bit

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,830
larger in 1982 there was a simple

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,210
protocol called smtp which probably must

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,960
have you recognize because we still use

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,210
it right and that was devised and it

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,420
became widely used in the early 80s come

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,830
according to wikipedia and i think what

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,510
they mean by widely used at that point

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,980
was like everybody who had a computer in

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:47,290
1982 so so widely used as a pretty low

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,120
bar at that point but everything

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,010
afterwards as far as emails concerned

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,930
was built to work on top of it and we

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,720
ended up with a decentralized system so

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,790
you know you can have hot meal I don't

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,070
know if people stop hot meal but or

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,600
gmail or any other kind of thing on your

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,520
own domain but it all talks to each

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,530
other through that protocol it's not a

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,760
perfect protocol but it is ubiquitous

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,590
and it does allow us to have a

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,120
decentralized service another example of

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,549
IRC which has also been with us for a

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,750
really long time is in the semi

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:23,320
decentralized category so in 1982 the

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,420
Commodore 64 allowed people to send text

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,970
messages to each other via quantum link

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,830
for a fee so as soon as people had

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,970
computers in their home they were into

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,640
this idea of being able to talk

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,250
instantly with each other but those were

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,090
all siloed so quantum link eventually

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:43,150
changed its name to AOL and then people

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,640
were using a I am and then other other

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,350
formats came around but until 2000 those

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,510
formats couldn't talk to each other so

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,130
you had like this again the siloed thing

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,850
and they're all fighting for dominance

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,650
until jabber allowed people to combine

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,590
their streams together and look at all

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,450
that the great thing is a jabbers free

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,650
software so anyone can build on top of

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:09,310
it anyone can have a server in that with

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:12,640
the XMPP but it's like a client-server

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,350
relationship so that means like the

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,109
various clients don't talk directly to

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,239
each other they go via intermediary so

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,829
that's a semi decentralized service that

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,949
we already have

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,720
oh if people have questions or like wait

00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:27,460
wait no it was nineteen eighty-one not

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,680
nineteen eighty-two feel free to raise

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,629
your hand I don't mind that so all of

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,909
this I've talked about just to let you

00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,189
know that decentralization is possible

00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:40,719
and it's possible for huge services that

00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:44,500
are widely used by lots of people all

00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:47,009
over the world so let's look at why we

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,479
might want or we might prefer

00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:52,090
decentralization over centralization so

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,129
I'm going to go like way back into some

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,960
of the pitfalls where you can see like

00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,539
kind of writ large from historical

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:03,250
perspective why centralization has been

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:04,990
problematic so a phone this is like this

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,190
is a private company tasked with

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,740
providing a public good and what you

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,340
ended up with was a lot of misplaced

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,830
costs and rampant corruption so my bail

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,860
the telecom industry had a regulated

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,800
monopoly that resulted in expensive long

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,360
distance for people and the expectation

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,190
of giant government handouts which we

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,259
paid for via our tax dollars so like a

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,159
government regulated centralized service

00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:35,800
has that pitfall the thing is is that

00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,629
this is still how telecom operates the

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,210
way that it works is that a company like

00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:42,430
verizon for example reports are lost on

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,800
their state filings and then that in

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,750
turn lowers their tax bill but it isn't

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,550
a real loss so they've been tasked with

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,169
providing a service and then what

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,270
they've done is they've created two

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,940
companies that also are called Verizon

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,069
Verizon Wireless and Verizon online that

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,180
dump all their expenses into the state

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:03,009
agency and then build them a vid not

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,020
build them but they pay a very small

00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,029
amount to the state agencies so like

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,050
they've put all the expenses in one

00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:12,940
place and then they are only getting a

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,889
tiny bit of revenue from the other

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,750
aspects of their own company so then

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,400
they report a loss because they're

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,400
providing all this service and getting a

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,169
tiny amount of money in and then it's

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,969
not just the tax write-off that happens

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,490
there it's also they use those numbers

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:31,870
to lobby for higher customer rates and

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,620
for more tax relief so so you can see

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,380
that a centralized sir

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,320
has its problems especially if we decide

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,630
that it's a public good to have that and

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,780
why is that relevant it is also how

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,760
broadband operates so we're also giving

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,130
a few large private companies money to

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,419
provide broadband and then they're lying

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,790
and rigging the numbers to get more

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,860
money for that project and we still have

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,600
a huge digital divide despite the

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,419
billions of tax determines that have

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,570
been passed out let me see I have a

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,280
number on it something something like 20

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,750
million school-aged children as a like

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,870
two years ago still didn't have internet

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,419
access even though verizon had been

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,030
given money to provide broadband for the

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,760
whole country and so the estimate is

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,030
that about 340 billion dollars has been

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:24,560
spent to get the entire country wired up

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,270
for broadband some wanted to give me 340

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,010
billion dollars I could go and spend a

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,680
year in Wyoming with like a metric ton

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,449
of cat5 and probably do a better job but

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,350
I wouldn't be getting the massive tax

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:39,620
write-off I guess so so that's that's

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,389
one issue the other issue that tends to

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,680
happen with centralized services is

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,660
censorship and so you can see when the

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,060
US Postal Service did a lot of censoring

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,280
when it didn't have any competition now

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,820
there is some competition for mailing

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,320
packages and letters FedEx and UPS and

00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,090
things like that but when they were the

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,039
only game in town they took it upon

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,020
themselves to also regulate the sorts of

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
things that people mailed so like new

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,349
beer advertisements no condoms in the

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:13,840
mail or what have you and that this law

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:16,930
was actually on the books until 1963 so

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,460
all these things that you might mail

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,099
were not allowed to be sent via the US

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,060
Postal Service and that effectively man

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,410
that you couldn't send them because

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:31,190
there wasn't another way to send things

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:33,950
in 1973 the Supreme Court ruled that

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,779
they kind of scaled back what's obscene

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,919
and they decided that just like a

00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:41,750
natural sex acts and that kind of stuff

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,579
would be obscene and that you could go

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,970
ahead and send beer advertisements and

00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:48,240
stuff but

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,399
finally in 1983 the court said the

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,920
government should not reduce the adult

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,750
population to reading what is only fit

00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,420
for children so from 1873 to 1983 they

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,240
had a pretty long run of deciding what

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,980
we could and couldn't send to each other

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,740
so I mean the internet now is full of

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,439
all kinds of stuff like this but if you

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,120
had a situation where you had bleak

00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:16,649
centralized news you can see where the

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,110
problem would come in and having one

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:24,810
arbiter of that kind of information so

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,910
the other thing that so now we'll get a

00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,750
little bit closer into the the present

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,750
the Telecommunications Act of 1996

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,629
resulted in a lot of centralizing of

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,779
television station ownership and so you

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:43,019
can see that that squeeze resulted in a

00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:46,680
very particular kind of splashing of

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:48,240
voices so 1996 was the first time that

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,920
the internet was included in the

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,079
broadcasting and spectrum allotment so

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,720
those are all like you together as well

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:58,040
and it allowed for a lot of media

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,990
cross-ownership and so the huge

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,459
consolidation meant big giveaways to the

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,829
outlets the larger outlets and represent

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:10,680
a very poor representation of women and

00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:12,540
minorities so it's basically like the

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,360
larger companies that had more money for

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,990
ad revenue were the ones that one in the

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,050
massive deregulation and the folks that

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:25,680
lost were women and people of color and

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,779
so you can see like right after the

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,240
duration these numbers like went to

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:33,000
where they are now and this is this is a

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,129
this is maybe like two years old but you

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,379
also seem really similar numbers for

00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,180
radio like radio was also consolidated

00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,009
so like give or take a couple of tenths

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,110
of a percentage you have the same kinds

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,809
of problems and the reason that that's

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,839
an issue is that you get certain kinds

00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:50,399
of news from you know everyone has their

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,340
own perspective on things and so if

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,970
you're getting like me

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,770
mainly like a money white male like very

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,330
entrenched perspective that's one

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,210
perspective and then you're not getting

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,700
as much of the other perspective so

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:06,660
consolidation tends to be a survival of

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,700
the wealthiest and you know so that's

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,070
you can see why that might be

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,700
problematic I can I could stump on that

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,520
one for a long time but Free Press

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,870
incidentally as a there an organization

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,690
that believes that a well informed

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,880
citizenry is really critical to working

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,040
democracy which I also happen to believe

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,470
but I would like to make sure that we

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,820
provide a web that includes everybody

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,320
and includes all different kinds of

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:38,890
voices so let's talk about the web a

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,320
series of tubes so as I mentioned

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:45,070
there's still a massive digital divide

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,320
where we have about of what did I say 20

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,890
million school-age children still don't

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:56,530
have access to the internet so so that's

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:58,510
a problem we also have oh yeah so here

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:02,770
we go so in that Telecommunications Act

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,780
we had the turn of the century 2000 the

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,820
United States was ranked fifth among the

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,100
world's nations in broadband but then a

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,310
few short years later as we sort of like

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,860
slid and de-emphasize that we dropped to

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:18,510
about 20 second place so we're not

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,470
really leading the you know the

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,900
technological revolution of getting

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:27,490
internet to everybody anymore so so

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,790
that's that's like a separate problem

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:33,550
and then when we look at the services

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,620
that we do have we see a lot of things

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,380
where we have like just one service in a

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,150
specific niche so you have you know like

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,560
Facebook everybody uses that for social

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,480
media and then like Flickr everybody

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,220
uses that to share pictures and Twitter

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,260
everybody's is that for micro blogging

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,850
and that has its own problems so even

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,520
once you get over the hump of getting

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,150
everybody into the internet revolution

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,380
which were a little slow on you still

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,900
have a lot of problems and I'll go

00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,970
through the kind of the main ones the

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,399
first

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,990
should come as no surprise privacy and

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,360
security so when you have a one size

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,889
fits all which is like the you know or a

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,269
lowest common denominator where the

00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:12,839
person who forgets their password like

00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:14,879
every week is is being accommodated then

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,399
you have certain kinds of problems even

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,230
when you don't have that you know like

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,189
LinkedIn just had all their lack of all

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,540
their password attacked this week so

00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:26,310
everyone is in one place which means

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,709
like everyone gets hacked at once

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,810
instead of a decentralized service where

00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,420
they would have to go and get like each

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,879
of the specific instances or you know it

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,779
limits the range of like the security

00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:43,170
vulnerabilities the you know that

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,000
one-size-fits-all is isn't isn't very

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,009
good for privacy either so like if you

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,079
look at facebook because they're not

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,629
particularly responsive to privacy

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,279
concerns you you don't really have

00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,649
another place to go you'll be like I'm

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,870
out of here I mean except that everybody

00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,910
I know is still on here so so it means

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,649
it makes it difficult when you have like

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:06,689
a single entity for a specific thing

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:09,629
over censorship so that's that's a

00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:11,819
problem you know where you see like

00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:14,370
someone decides that like a gay couple

00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:17,100
kissing is offensive and so then that

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,500
gets taken down or it take corporate

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,930
messages like all cases a message from

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,279
the corporation to say like oh we think

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,490
that might be slander and it's like

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,129
maybe it is maybe it isn't but you know

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,199
Joe user versus like massive company's

00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,089
sending a message isn't going to that

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,009
isn't going to weigh out fair use also

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:38,459
gets kind of trampled on this you see it

00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:40,230
a lot on YouTube where maybe it's satire

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,850
because like they drew mustaches on

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,740
everybody in the video but other than

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,420
that it's just like a CNN video or

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,750
something and then you might get that

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:51,029
taken down because it doesn't it doesn't

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,920
fit their fair use or they don't feel

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:55,920
like going to bat for an individual user

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,720
instead of instead of the company that

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,339
sent them the court the copyright

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,329
takedown message and then you see

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,579
analogs in print media all the time

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:08,459
where things that the advertisers on the

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:10,760
website don't like turn into what goes

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,250
in or what doesn't go in

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,130
the paper or to the magazine so you know

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,620
there's um there's a couple of examples

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,170
of like tobacco companies leaning really

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,540
hard on magazines doing stories about

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,910
like health impacts for tobacco and

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,430
they're like we advertise in the

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,320
magazine and then turns out or Marlboro

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,620
ad is right opposite like a story about

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,550
lung cancer so do you want the tobacco

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,260
in money or do you want the you know

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,500
expose on lung cancer and it's like well

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,200
the tobacco money we get every month so

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,330
you can see where that goes so

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,670
consolidation of online services can

00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,190
also use to lead to less diversity of

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,170
viewpoints so YouTube and other places

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,290
that kind of attract a really toxic

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,850
comment culture so that means it if you

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,380
ever see like a video like if someone

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,090
puts up videos of their kids like they

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,740
usually have to disable the comments all

00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,140
together like they can't have any

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,060
comments because like they want their

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,260
kids to be like oh look i put it up and

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,570
then you heard there's comments and then

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,190
there's someone like you know I'd do her

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:17,450
when she's legal and it's like what no

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,740
no so like YouTube comments end up

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,000
repelling other types of you I'm sure

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,520
you guys have seen stuff where you're

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,470
just like how did how does this person

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,770
function and think that that's okay to

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,570
put on the Internet other types of

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,120
social norms get set up and perpetuated

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,800
on other sites to certain media rises to

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,470
the top because people really like it

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,380
does regardless of whether it's true or

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:43,010
useful so you see like on dig and read

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,190
it like you know something that might be

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,590
useful and impactful like sinks to the

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,990
bottom of the page where like people are

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,330
talking about like Who stone so like

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,520
actors sleeping with or drunken brawl or

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,410
whatever like rises to the top so you

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:02,360
have this like sort of what's it like a

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:05,089
tyranny of like the the comments where

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,699
like nothing nothing that talks about

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:11,690
other than the majority like rises to

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:13,370
the top one of the things that we could

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,660
have with decentralized services would

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:20,300
be customized online identities so

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,520
instead of choosing to be fully

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,130
anonymous or fully

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,410
like which is a lot of times the sort of

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,540
situation you have on online services or

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,490
depending on the service like you have

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,620
different varying degrees of what you

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,680
can do but instead of having like the

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,510
off the rack with like a free software

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,130
service you could decide like oh I want

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,720
this part to be public and I want this

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,390
part to be anonymous and I want to

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,050
finally green control over that

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,940
situation so like if you're sharing

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,470
pictures for instance and this is one of

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,650
the examples we think about it media

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,540
goblin you when you do flickr it's like

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,370
you share it with everybody you share it

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,980
with like an invite only but you don't

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,830
have as much control first aid groups

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,960
and so the example that we always think

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,970
of is like an elementary school might be

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,560
taking pictures of like the plants or

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,850
the gerbil they're taking care of or

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,950
whatever and they might want to share it

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,410
with other elementary schools but not

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,650
the wider internet and so being able to

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,360
have like more kinds of like groups or

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:23,750
gradations in the amount of like public

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,090
versus private when you share is one of

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,950
the things that a decentralized service

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,950
would be able to provide so you would be

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,150
able to get like exactly what you want

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,340
and you could also be the curator of

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,590
your own media and your own sorts of

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,790
feeds and pick a little bit more

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:43,550
specifically like what you get big also

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,500
means less responsive so that's another

00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,230
one of the pitfalls of a centralized

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:52,430
service there's a lady who lost her

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,490
Twitter account because her blog name

00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:57,350
was the same as a company that had you

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,360
know just incorporated within the past

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,400
year and she'd been using that Twitter

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,200
handle for seven years but when Twitter

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,660
about the note like some lady is using

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,640
our company name and we want it and

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,840
they're like oh okay but then she she

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,730
had lots of followers and so she

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,400
contacted a lot of them individually and

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,160
did eventually get her name back but it

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,020
took a long time and and a big process

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,790
and a lot of effort on her part to get

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,130
this like huge public ground swell of

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,520
leg hey give me my twitter handle back

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,920
so and that's not it's not illegal like

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,780
when you sign a term of service you say

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,980
i will put all this stuff on and then

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,740
you can do whatever you want with it

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,190
including erasing it or wiping me off

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,309
the site

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:42,409
entirely as you see fit without any

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:44,750
process or any kind of notification one

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:47,539
of my friends has a he grew up with

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:51,110
someone whose last name is deeth DEA th

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,269
and she wanted to be on linkedin and

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,460
facebook with her actual legal name

00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:59,029
which looks like the word death so it

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,100
gets tweaked as as like a fake so people

00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,740
are like you can't really be Molly death

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,450
on Facebook that's not a real name she's

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,470
like no it really is it is really her

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:11,600
name and so she you know she loses out

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,539
she sent messages she never gets any

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,039
response so she's a she's on there as a

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,080
fake name when she wanted to be on there

00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,200
using a real name and you know so you

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,149
don't have a lot of responsiveness and

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,460
that also means that new features come

00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:27,049
out slowly and not because of username

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,809
and but because of like advertiser

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,759
demand or some other kind of driving

00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,340
force so unless the users demand

00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,889
something in like really large numbers

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:40,490
and sometimes even not still then you

00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:44,649
don't see any kind of changes that our

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:47,269
user driven so so those are problems

00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:51,200
let's take a look at some of the

00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:53,059
existing services today so how many

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,419
people in hearing a status net or

00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:59,899
identica okay then this room is maybe a

00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:02,000
little bit that's that's a larger

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:05,539
representation than in the rest of the

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,070
world i imagine twitter is obviously so

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,159
much more popular did the people that

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,129
use identical also use twitter yea or no

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,929
yeah so you use both okay we're about

00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:19,340
half it seems okay and so um yeah so but

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:20,809
there are a lot of great tools which I'm

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,970
going to get into in the next minute or

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:26,360
two media goblin is the project that i

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,009
work on media hosting using free

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,889
software that turned out to be the

00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:33,110
easier problem and then gracefully

00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,669
federating turned out to be the harder

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,039
problem which is probably comes as no

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:41,149
surprise but so we're working on that

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,279
piece now diaspora it worse is a system

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:44,000
of pods but so far i think they just

00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,340
have the one

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,260
mean instant so it's not it's not

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,360
working in the same way that identica is

00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,830
where there's a lot of other instances

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:56,270
happening within businesses and

00:21:51,830 --> 00:22:01,520
community yeah there are other pods

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:04,910
running okay is it right right okay all

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,510
right so get a pod and then frienda

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:11,570
kisura is another layer on top of the

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,830
existing social media and so that's free

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,170
software and it gives you a single

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,810
stream so there's some tools there that

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,150
might be useful in building other tools

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,920
and they in specific they've repurposed

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,730
a lot of the identica stuff they're both

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,770
PHP projects so you know those sharing

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,620
back and forth is pretty easy there and

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:33,170
then a buddy cloud is a federated social

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,940
network that uses XMPP so that's like

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,430
built on the the jabber stuff that we

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,230
talked about before um but it doesn't

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,210
really feel very web like and again that

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,100
it has that like having to go up to the

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,310
server so the clients still have a

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,380
mediator in between so so you know

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,490
that's not the same as like you know

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,540
running pods or specific instances so

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,150
these are some of the tools that have

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,250
already been built the greed is is that

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,570
there are like a million free software

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,120
web development libraries and the github

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,640
attitude of being like let's do

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,200
everything like almost all the way open

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,820
stores means that there are a lot of

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,410
freely licensed tools but the job

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,270
doesn't get finished because each

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,060
project has a little bit of like secret

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,010
sauce that is proprietary license so you

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,520
know you'd have to add your own secret

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:26,840
sauce if you want to use those but there

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,180
are still a lot of things so the serving

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:34,520
between instances like the old style is

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:37,070
to use a poll which is a sort of its

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,470
resource intensive if you're doing a lot

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,260
of small instances so like if you go on

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,140
vacation for a week and you decide not

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,730
to micro blog while you're there

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,310
everyone who's following you in a pool

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,050
kind of a situation would be sending

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,790
messages to your server that whole week

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,750
that you're just on the beach and

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:59,240
make a push is a huge boon for

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,040
decentralized services because it means

00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,720
that when you come back you're just like

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,730
hey guys I had a great vacation it was

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,320
awesome and sure you just push something

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,910
out instead of having all this like back

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,940
and forth like do you have anything new

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:13,310
yet do you have anything new yet salmon

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,440
is a push for private messages so like

00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,740
if you know a lot of social media has

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,320
the private messages and that's great so

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,730
that's already built the XMPP we talked

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,470
about RSS Adam there is there is like

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,410
someone working to build some

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,200
decentralized services with Adam and

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,460
then Oh status if you if you are a

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,870
developer and you're interested in

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,760
working on decentralized services I

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,290
would say go and check out the first

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,750
thing you should look at is the o status

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,330
suite of tools there's like tons and

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,120
tons of stuff that's already built there

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,800
and you know no point in reinventing the

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,830
wheel because it's all free software so

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:56,240
you don't have to as well as so as well

00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,160
as like the sharing across distances

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,230
there's also a lot of identity

00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,160
management tools already built like open

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:08,840
ID in browser ID webfinger is a great

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,490
one for well it's a great one for

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,110
accessing public stuff so if you want to

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,620
search and see if your friend is on a

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:18,350
specific network you can use that Oh F

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,120
is a lot of single sign-on tools gpg is

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,630
secure but the user interface isn't

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,100
great a number of years ago is trying to

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,530
work with some folks to build good new

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,350
social which would have been like a you

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:33,740
know like a completely free software a

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,210
GPL social media and we had this what we

00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,310
thought this brilliant idea like will

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,690
base it on gpg we thought we were the

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,120
first people that ever thought of it

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,430
we're not there were a couple of other

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,260
like failed like pretty crafty looking

00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:49,549
projects that are also social media

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:52,110
based on gpg the thing about gpg is the

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,419
people forget their passwords they just

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,039
do especially on social media when it's

00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,240
like low stakes it's one thing if you

00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:02,970
you know are working to make a

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,070
revolution happen and like some country

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,870
and you really need to send private

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,909
messages then you pay good attention and

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,470
you remember your gpg key but if you're

00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:12,390
just like hey guys I just ate a cheese

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,950
sandwich like the stakes are really low

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,559
so people tend to lose their password

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:20,340
for that stuff so let's say you ex isn't

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,500
great there are salmon magic signatures

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,970
those are really good and working great

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,309
so far so um those uh it has encryption

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,500
built-in and so that's that's great and

00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:33,690
then as the cell is another tool for

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,429
secure web browsing so there are a lot

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,230
of tools for identity management so if

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,110
if you're thinking like oh I have this

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,409
great idea for like free software

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:45,150
decentralized you know web service don't

00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,740
go building your own identity management

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,620
tools because there are tons that

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,409
already exist is anyone thinking about

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,539
doing that maybe not yet is it too early

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:58,770
for like a brand new software project to

00:26:54,539 --> 00:27:02,130
percolate up okay so these are the parts

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,380
that need work so to really hard

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,240
problems are decentralized search so

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,360
when you want to look for groups and

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,039
tags across a whole bunch of interest

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,490
instances that are loosely federated

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,500
together you had a lot of problems so so

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,559
that's one of the the hard problems and

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:24,419
then the categorization and then or you

00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:28,169
did you want to ask a question with a

00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:35,900
wet yeah see hmm i don't know about ya

00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:40,049
see great okay so ya see is peer-to-peer

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:42,200
ok and then so who is using that and for

00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,200
what

00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:54,159
great okay oh so that's like general

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,190
search over the Internet okay so yeah

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,620
this would be like for specific

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:06,909
instances and services but it's possible

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:08,639
that that could be a I'm sorry so you

00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:12,700
could use it for your own project

00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:14,409
awesome I'll take a look one of the

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,059
other problems that decentralized

00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:19,059
services have been struggling with is

00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:20,260
spam handling Oh statuses is doing a

00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:23,260
pretty good job with that on the

00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:26,049
micro-blogging but they have like a

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,210
certain size and you know as they get

00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,070
bigger scaling up with the spam control

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,309
is really difficult the way that most

00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,529
centralized services use do spam control

00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:38,139
is they have like a huge volume of

00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:40,000
information so they have a lot of

00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:41,830
up-to-the-minute data on what is and

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,720
what isn't spam and then because they're

00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,880
centralized they just send to one place

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,039
this is the new definition of what is an

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,840
isn't spam but with decentralized

00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:52,570
services you would have a whole loose

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,630
Federation of sites that were all

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:58,960
beginning spam so spam control across

00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:02,590
federated small instances is it done

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,690
sort of special problem to do well so if

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:08,169
that's a thing that is exciting to use

00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:13,179
in the decentralized web service world

00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:15,909
could totally use your talent so the

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:20,169
other thing where I think we need a lot

00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:22,299
of work is it needs to be pretty how

00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:24,429
many times have you tried to get a

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,080
friend to use something that is free

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:30,870
software and they've looked at it and

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,799
been like know anyone yeah they're like

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:35,470
immediately they're like where's the

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,510
button what is the black box why do I

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,350
have to type in this weird string of

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:43,480
letters like so I think in order to see

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,490
a lot of adoption on decentralized

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,809
services we have to work a lot on user

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,289
interface so that means if you're a

00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:54,780
designer or UX expert there's a lot of

00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:58,380
great stuff that could use your help

00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,810
so people are used to a really slick

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,970
graphical user interface and they're

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,340
used to having stuff called like you

00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,470
know something that makes sense and not

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,480
having to hop out to the command line to

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:14,130
make it really work and so decentralized

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,800
services are going to have to hit a

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,690
certain standard before we're going to

00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,850
see a lot of adoption so that's more

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:24,780
that's like kind of approaching the

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:28,710
social problem the other thing is it's

00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:31,050
it's going to have to be easy I did this

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,000
talk at linux fest northwest and i was

00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,130
told that actually the poodle is the

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,740
easiest balloon animal which i didn't

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,000
know but it doesn't it didn't look easy

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,090
to me because I've never made any

00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,970
balloon animals I really a balloon

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:49,740
animal experts in the audience no one

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:53,910
awesome is the poodle actually easy that

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,800
one is okay all right so yeah so the the

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:59,970
point of that is that one person's easy

00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:03,450
is another person's like oh no no I

00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:06,060
don't know you do it so in order to see

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,760
wide adoption and lots of people who

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,050
sing their own instance free software

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,430
decentralized services that are going to

00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,240
have to be as easy as installing

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,640
WordPress on your blog is today so in

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,190
the in the little dashboard when you

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,360
sign up to get web hosting you're going

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,010
to have to be able to click a button

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,780
that's like oh yeah I'd like to also

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,660
have my own micro blogging and I'd also

00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,190
like to host my own media and just click

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,990
a button and it's going to have to work

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,790
just like that right now there's too

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,950
many steps and that's even for media

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,830
Goblin and I'm constantly trying to push

00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,920
us to get more you know user

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,280
friendliness better directions and you

00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:47,540
know we still have a lot of problems

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:50,400
it's it's tricky it's still difficult

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:53,130
there might be some tools that are being

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,810
built today that could help us abstract

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,810
the deployment a little bit better so

00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:00,090
like open shift or maybe juju might give

00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,770
us a little bit you know people would

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,460
have another layer of abstraction and

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,230
not have to get into the details so I

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,789
think it's going to have to be really

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,559
easy

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,309
or someone without any technical

00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:15,139
knowledge to post their own instance of

00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:17,389
microblogging their own instance of

00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:22,340
media sharing or whatever else we're

00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:25,340
going to build right so so I would like

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:28,989
to see more people working on district

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:33,429
relay services this is my general pit

00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:35,179
that's crowd surfing you guys know so

00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,320
there's a couple different ways you

00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,379
could help you could help with an

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,629
existing project like like statusnet or

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:44,809
media goblin or buddy cloud or something

00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:47,659
as a designer or a coder or a translator

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:51,080
or a documentary you could help start

00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:53,419
new projects that don't either already

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,879
exist as a proprietary analog or ones

00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:58,159
that don't exist at all so some of the

00:32:55,879 --> 00:33:00,229
things that I think could be neat to see

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,809
centralized would be like LinkedIn

00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:05,559
obviously centralizing is not working

00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:07,879
great there but like you know I think

00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,580
different industries might like to have

00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:12,320
different types of things that they

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,739
track and ways that they interact with

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,809
people traffic is another thing that I

00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:21,619
think you know could be decentralized

00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:23,239
where you have like each city might keep

00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,399
track of their own traffic so that when

00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:28,669
you look at what's going on like for

00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,169
instance boston vs new york have really

00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,269
different needs for traffic like new

00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:35,090
york is a grid and if you have a problem

00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:36,320
like 20 blocks over here then you know

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,200
you're going to have a problem down here

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,879
because it's all on this massive grid so

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,649
that has its own patterns where's Boston

00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:45,679
is a whole craggy little pile of streets

00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:47,690
and we have seasonal traffic like we

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,090
have a huge student population so stuff

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,220
that's a trafficking nightmare during

00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:55,789
the school year is like free sailing

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:58,009
like all through the summer so and then

00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:00,019
they the great thing would be as you

00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:01,970
drive from one place to another is if

00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:05,599
you could just seamlessly pick up like

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:07,129
great you know forecast of what the

00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,500
traffic you're going to hit is going to

00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:11,869
be like in each city as you go forward

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,369
but not having like a one-size-fits-all

00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:15,919
because then you end up with sort of

00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,629
like an unrealistic expectation of like

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,230
how long is this traffic going to happen

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:20,149
and

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,580
you know what can I do to avoid it and

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:24,530
is that likely to fill up immediately as

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:28,460
soon as everyone else sees that route

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,899
one is is blocked up healthcare data is

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,090
another thing that might be great to see

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:34,190
decentralized like to have a lot of like

00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,020
interoperability between that data but

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,540
not have exactly the same data in each

00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,490
place like obviously there's different

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,040
needs and the way that the data has been

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,250
collected is different and so you know

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,840
so there's a lot of different places

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,369
that you can see that and I think there

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,780
would be a lot of use to being able to

00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:53,300
aggregate some of the higher level

00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,980
healthcare data but not necessarily do a

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:59,060
one-size-fits-all on the individual

00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:02,270
persons data right so so maybe start a

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,510
new project that fills another federated

00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,430
need another way that you could help is

00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,130
try running an instance of an existing

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,800
project and then filing bugs there

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,859
you'll find some I'm promise and and

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,700
give feedback on how how the directions

00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:22,400
were like how long it took and how well

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,910
it works and you know for all different

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,230
kinds of situations and and then if you

00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,820
if you don't want to do any of those

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,859
things I'm sure you could throw money at

00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,869
one of the existing projects like will

00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:35,990
take money I'm sure Oh status will take

00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:37,790
money maybe you want to have like a

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:41,570
federated instance within your company

00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:43,700
there's a lot of micro blog like within

00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,040
certain within individual individual

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,290
companies that happens and you know so

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,450
you could fund having your own custom

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:55,160
instance inside of your company or your

00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:57,140
school or what have you so let's see I

00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,560
spoke really fast because they drink a

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:03,260
lot of coffee this morning so that's

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,290
then that's those are my picture credits

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,119
and so I would love to hear from you

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,850
guys this is obviously it's an evolving

00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,560
thing that decentralized stuff it's like

00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:16,910
there's always like little bits and

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,180
pieces coming up all the time w3c tracks

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,609
a lot of the work going into

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,070
decentralized services but they you know

00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:27,930
have a burst of excitement and then

00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,450
a lot of inactivity in that and so like

00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,460
you know like when I looked at their

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,930
stuff from two years ago there's like 15

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,510
projects on there that have completely

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,640
disappeared like and there and those are

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,880
all gone so you know if you know of new

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,260
services I'd like to hear about them and

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,210
but other than that any kind of general

00:36:43,260 --> 00:37:01,490
questions I'll open up for questions

00:36:45,210 --> 00:37:01,490
yeah yeah yeah

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:07,430
Yeah right so that's a larger so the

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,820
question is I had mentioned one person's

00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,380
easy as another person is hard and that

00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:15,830
often reporting bugs which I recommend

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:19,520
doing becomes like a long drawn-out

00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:20,960
process of going to get and then finding

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,580
out that there's a bunch of dependencies

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,190
that aren't mentioned in the readme and

00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,119
that that is a problem so that

00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,369
especially with smaller projects was

00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,900
just three or four people they don't

00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,670
understand how important that is and how

00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,970
do you fix that so that is that that's

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:40,970
basically the question I think that that

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:43,070
is a that is not specific to federated

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:47,570
projects but it certainly impacts the

00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:50,180
uptake of federated projects I think

00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:52,580
that the free software community has to

00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,589
either decide like are we just building

00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,420
this for ourselves or are we building

00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:58,849
this because we want people to use it

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,589
and if we decide that we want people to

00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,810
use the tools that we're building then

00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:07,010
we have to be serious about making it

00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:10,430
usable and being friendly and having the

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:13,040
user interface be good and that means

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,930
that means like inviting people in and

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,930
being like I will bribe you with beer or

00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:20,330
cookies please please please try and

00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,099
install this like and then tell me how

00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:24,050
it goes or let me sit with you and then

00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:28,910
I'll keep feeding you cookies you know

00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:31,490
and so I think they absolutely have to

00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:34,490
ask for help not putting dependencies in

00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,260
the readme is you might as well just say

00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,750
like i don't i don't care if anyone uses

00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,160
this I mean I used to do package

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,530
verification for the Free Software

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,270
Foundation and and I would try and

00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,310
download stuff and then it would be like

00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,500
oh you're missing this and this and this

00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,330
and it was like do you really want

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,980
anyone to use this like they sent me a

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,450
note saying like please put this in the

00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,820
free software directors to other people

00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,580
could find it but then they hadn't

00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,010
listed all the dependencies even in the

00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:04,660
readme and I'm like what what is that

00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:06,280
you know and so I think that that

00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,839
is a cultural change that the free

00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,630
software community is going to have to

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,410
really embrace if we want to see all the

00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:17,230
benefits of free software go beyond our

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:20,500
own community so I think that's really

00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:24,160
critical you know and I'm glad you

00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,960
brought it up and so I I don't know you

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,890
want like there's no silver bullet there

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,240
so like I can't like you know wrap that

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,369
kind of comment and question up with a

00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:37,420
like and then just put in a table of

00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,980
contents or whatever so but yeah so that

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,230
that's that's great and I could talk

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,030
about that for a long long time on how

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,119
free software projects could do a better

00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:48,700
job of you know getting more users and

00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,520
getting more help within their projects

00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:56,130
so do people have other questions or

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,130
comments over here and then over here

00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:07,730
installation of WordPress I've noticed a

00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,610
lot of web post will offer one quick

00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,050
installation of WordPress I was

00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:14,210
interested to see that I was actually

00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:17,770
hoping that my host with off of the same

00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:21,740
force XXL features to be posting my own

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:27,890
instance looked into setting up myself

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:41,720
just didn't happen this is a safe space

00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:47,270
it's okay we can consider just any

00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:54,200
response or any request again and that

00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:56,990
was from your web host okay to encourage

00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,290
web hosts to adopt for one quick

00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,420
installation softy centralizes we're

00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,880
happy we replicate the success that work

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,460
precision because to me seems like that

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,060
this form of widespread adoption of

00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:13,160
Messrs

00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,850
right so the question is what might be

00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,260
some good strategies for getting other

00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:20,240
free software services to adopt the

00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,550
one-click thing that WordPress has for

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,350
web posts right now I think the question

00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:29,930
there might first go to who has done the

00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:32,450
interstitial work to make the one click

00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,790
WordPress installation happen and so I

00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,740
think like an individual user saying

00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:40,040
like I really wish there was one quick

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:43,790
and 1-click installation for XYZ is

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:48,260
going to be less useful in pushing web

00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:50,780
post services to do that then hey I run

00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,480
this decentralized service and we made a

00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,810
really pretty thing that has like a very

00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:00,020
clear value for a person with a website

00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:01,880
and all you have to do is put it in it's

00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,740
the same thing for when you want to get

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,610
like something covered by the press

00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:09,350
you're not like say like hey my friend

00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:12,110
at the press like will you cover my

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:14,180
project you say hey I wrote like five

00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,130
paragraphs the first three or if you

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,570
want a short version of the story and if

00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,310
you want to get into more depth than you

00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,510
can print all five let me know if you

00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:23,540
have questions or I left something out

00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,550
so like you've done the work and then

00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,940
said like please include it in your

00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:31,820
existing resource so I think the

00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,280
existing you know the work needs to be

00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,410
done and then can be handed first so I

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,350
think that probably needs to happen and

00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:41,420
then then you know and it still might

00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,430
take a little bit of people asking and

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,710
saying like oh how come the one-click

00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,570
thing isn't here like I saw it's

00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,119
available and then give them a link

00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,859
again like I want one click statusnet so

00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:55,430
as they get a whole bunch of notes with

00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:58,070
a link to lay you know here it is then I

00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:00,619
think it would seem easy whereas your

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:02,450
initial request sounded like can you do

00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:04,460
a bunch of work on behalf of a project

00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:07,940
that you may never have heard of which

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:11,690
isn't much harder ask I think so yeah

00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:51,849
and then we have a question over here

00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:51,849
oh yeah I seen those monster

00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:15,510
no treatises for you all right

00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:35,920
Plus right

00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,530
yeah so the question is about the

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,450
network effects of existing services and

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,550
how do you deal with the like the very

00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,440
real social problem of like why would I

00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,510
use your weirdo free software thing when

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:09,569
all of my friends are on you know

00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:13,660
Facebook or what have you I think that

00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:15,160
there's probably there's probably some

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,050
lessons to be learned from things like

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,510
WordPress where it's kind of like oh

00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,160
well if you have a website like of

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,170
course you have a blog on it like why

00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,540
would you not have a blog and making it

00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,790
like normal and be like Oh everyone's

00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,140
website now has this like Oh check out i

00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,050
have my own micro blog i have my own

00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:34,000
thing so that's one thing like making it

00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,650
more normal and having more

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,220
conversations about it and that's a

00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:42,609
pretty diffuse thing I think the the

00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,560
second piece of that would be the one of

00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:47,260
the great things about free software is

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,380
that we can add all kinds of little like

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,440
bells and whistles and customizations

00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,680
that make it kind of fun like an

00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,240
interesting like you know like like I

00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,180
was talking about like being able to

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,569
really finely control the privacy and

00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:07,630
the sharing on your media hosting that

00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:09,640
could you know be really appealing to

00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,530
specific folks and then and then they're

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,960
using it in that instance and then maybe

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,569
would see the value of in other places

00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:20,079
so there might be ways that we could

00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:23,500
improve upon existing network services

00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:26,050
that would make people like oh hey how

00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,730
come like you get to share like weirdo

00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,380
video things are like why is it really

00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,240
easy for you to share like music clips

00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,970
on your social media but not on mine

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:37,359
like or you know whatever it is still

00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,220
like I think maybe like the challenge is

00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,619
to find ways to make the free software

00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,050
service like just a little bit cooler

00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:45,570
and

00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:47,670
I don't know exactly like how we do that

00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,770
I mean I have lots of ideas but i don't

00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:53,070
know how to implement them all in code

00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,630
so i think that making them a little bit

00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:58,320
cooler and then talking to people about

00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:00,030
the very real like this is you know why

00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,950
I do it know what I think it's important

00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,630
and why I think or why I think it's

00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,400
great like depending on whether you're

00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,040
you know talking about privacy you're

00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,500
talking about in an additional sort of

00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,090
feature does that sorting it I mean

00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,980
again there's no silver bullet so I

00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:19,290
can't just be like and then put sparkles

00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:21,330
on it so which I wish I could so I don't

00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:23,220
know I mean of other people have Diego

00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:27,470
question or comment on what you think

00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,470
would make network the network effects

00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,800
all right over here and then in the

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,800
green thanks

00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:43,320
worse places okay

00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:03,789
huh

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,279
but he will be spelled with before we

00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,279
got 20

00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:29,170
yeah so the question is or comment is

00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,670
that we have another problem in that the

00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:34,210
devices are locked down and then come

00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:37,180
already like you know yeah prepared to

00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:39,460
have the proprietary services and the

00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,260
the main centralized services work

00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,680
really easily with your phone and people

00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,740
are used to that and the vendors don't

00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:52,270
want to support like our free software

00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:54,310
or decentralized services yeah I I do

00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:58,300
agree that that is another problem that

00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:01,450
the devices are locked down and you know

00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:04,300
it's I mean I think offering like oh you

00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:06,160
know it's obviously people a lot of

00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,760
people prefer apps as opposed to like a

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,570
web version of a certain site but having

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,720
a good web version which a lot of

00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:18,280
projects don't do now you know it's like

00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,470
you when you look for something on your

00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,970
phone and you're like a didn't even

00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,530
bother to do a mobile version I never

00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,360
understand why restaurants don't do a

00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:29,290
good mobile version of their website but

00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:32,130
that's another rant so I think having a

00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:34,750
good mobile version of of your

00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:37,300
decentralized service is one place to

00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:40,240
start but I think in the hardware wrong

00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:43,000
we need to keep pushing on having

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,090
devices that are open it's difficult

00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,610
because you know Nokia's you know isn't

00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:52,030
doing the stuff anymore they're going

00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:54,490
with the windows mobile and you know

00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:57,160
even the android stuff like i had a one

00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:59,050
of the older g1's and and that came with

00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,060
like almost no stuff and now i have like

00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,950
a newer android phone and it came with

00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,560
like a whole bunch of garbage that i had

00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:08,410
to like out from there and there doesn't

00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:11,710
happen to be like there's so many phones

00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:14,650
now there doesn't happen to be a good

00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,810
you know script for routing that

00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,610
particular phone so I got the one that

00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:20,740
was cheap and then they didn't make very

00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:22,780
many of that once no one figured out how

00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:26,050
to read that one so like I have a bunch

00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:28,790
of garbage on there I think but um it's

00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:31,790
I think that's like a parallel but

00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:34,820
eatin necessary but like a little bit

00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:37,400
separate like the push for continuing to

00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,860
have access on our mobile devices but

00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,840
for the decentralized side the I think

00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,910
one of the critical pieces that still

00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,040
isn't fully in places making sure that

00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:55,820
there's always a great mobile version of

00:51:46,040 --> 00:52:03,830
your site yeah well yeah I mean like

00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:05,510
people are done right people people

00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,370
microblog when they're waiting for the

00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:10,130
bus or sitting in the airport and so

00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:13,250
like if they can't use like the free one

00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:15,410
in that same way I mean how many we have

00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:18,710
identical users what do people use to

00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,870
make her blog on a danica I have mustard

00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:23,480
on my phone and that's what you've got

00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:28,340
ya everyone has mustard it's not perfect

00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:33,350
but yeah but it does it more or less

00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:36,530
does the job so yeah so that's um yeah I

00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:39,080
think it did intersects with a lot of

00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:42,320
other issues working on decentralized

00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:45,080
stuff but yeah under estimating the

00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,210
ubiquitous pneus of mobile devices is

00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:52,390
not gonna is not going to be the way to

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,390
go for sure and then we had over here

00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,790
mm-hmm

00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:13,660
email itself useless except for contact

00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:20,089
right

00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,420
what to get

00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,420
why

00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:33,559
possibly

00:53:30,779 --> 00:53:33,559
conference like this

00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,869
where values

00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,759
or

00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,610
okay so the the common is that things

00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,260
like Twitter and email came about

00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:59,280
because of specific me in a specific

00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:03,730
community at a specific time and that

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,770
one way to increase adoption of free

00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:07,810
software decentralized services would be

00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:09,910
to piggyback on a big event like this

00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:12,490
one or something else and make sure that

00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:14,710
you know people are like you know like

00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:17,200
they do sometimes where there are scenic

00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:19,120
on their name tag and then you dad like

00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,990
me we all see your identica handle and

00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:25,500
and all that stuff and that yeah that

00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:28,750
really like making sure that it's not

00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:31,180
and I think this is a crucial point that

00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:34,570
it's not if we build it they will come

00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:36,580
it's like no we have to like go to where

00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:38,080
they are load them all on the bus and

00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,420
drive them over to where it is and then

00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:43,570
be like until you make an account like

00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:48,340
you can't leave or we'll all be grumpy

00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:50,740
out you know sticks but yeah I agree and

00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,570
then making it like the fun thing like

00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:56,410
where it's like hey let's all do it

00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:57,700
right now you know so yes so in the

00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,440
spirit of that if you don't have an

00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,990
identical account yet you should sign up

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:05,200
for one do people have other questions

00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:07,260
or comments or things right here in the

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,260
front

00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:40,619
hey I don't see what facebook how does

00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:42,150
that what you get into Facebook serially

00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:46,229
hard time for any sort of decentralized

00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:49,259
product having any success if the RSS

00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:52,200
world space to it's like the others

00:55:49,259 --> 00:55:56,420
there's like the babe you know the the

00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:58,650
popular blog people celebrities own call

00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,769
people have their own logs as well

00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:04,579
that's just no just I see this stuffing

00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:08,160
mobloc just writing any sort of me

00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:10,260
bounced off the market

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:14,250
I'd always good what this test to that

00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:16,670
can't succeed what else Yeah right yeah

00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,670
so

00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:39,170
yeah so um this is a question comment is

00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:41,090
that you've had your blog for a long

00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:44,840
time but then people always want to know

00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:48,980
like why don't you put status updates

00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:58,910
about your decentralized blog on social

00:56:48,980 --> 00:57:13,520
media and thanks yeah oh we agree right

00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:15,620
so right so so how do we educate people

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,840
about the availability of decentralized

00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:25,610
services or the desire like why they

00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:29,780
might want them knowing it yeah now I

00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:33,230
think uh yeah we have Kickstarter now I

00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:36,740
guess all right so uh yeah like how do

00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:39,170
we overcome that you know the how do we

00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:41,690
crawl out of the pit of obscurity that

00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:43,610
the most decentralized stuff lives in

00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,260
right now when everybody wants to know

00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,970
like why didn't you talk about your

00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,910
decentralized service on Twitter or

00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:52,100
Facebook so like well started missing

00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:53,900
the point although I admit media goblin

00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,700
has a twitter feed I barely look at it

00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,550
but when we update stuff we put it there

00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:01,610
and I realize how ridiculously ironic

00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:03,830
that is but um you know we were like

00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:08,090
well you know Emily outside the Diaspora

00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:10,970
count an identical account too but yeah

00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:16,100
I don't know like Evan / drama who were

00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:19,310
so on Oh status he he works on he thinks

00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:22,010
one way is to constantly post via the

00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:23,870
free software service to the proprietary

00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:25,400
service so people will be like how come

00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,590
no one's always coming from something

00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,780
called statusnet I don't know if that

00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,670
works I think it's probably a

00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,650
combination of having a lot of

00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:35,720
individual conversations with everybody

00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:36,780
and then also making sure that when

00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,010
people are like okay

00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,620
okay you've been talking about this

00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:42,540
thing forever like where is it how do i

00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,940
get to it and then when they finally

00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,920
look at it they're like oh it's awesome

00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,750
it's way better than I thought it was

00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:53,340
going to be like because when you showed

00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:55,350
me you know like camp in 2005 that

00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:58,050
wasn't so great you know like or

00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:59,910
whatever it's better now but i think

00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,410
it's it's important to make sure that

00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,270
you know like we're having the

00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:06,600
educational conversations but then when

00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:08,640
we come were like oh you know it's like

00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,470
inviting someone over for a sandwich and

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,780
your leg i put the bread out in the yard

00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,850
and the ham is in a bucket in the

00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,860
bathroom and then like we might or might

00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:18,660
not have mustard and it's like you

00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:21,450
invited me over for a hand sandwich this

00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,160
sucks so making sure that it's like no I

00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:24,950
already made them and I cut the crusts

00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,120
off if that's what you like whatever and

00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,740
still having those conversations and

00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,410
then being ready when they're like okay

00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:35,130
how do I do it and making sure it really

00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:40,230
is like all put together so I think I

00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:42,630
think we're out of time my email is here

00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:44,700
people think of other questions later

00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:47,310
that they weren't asked me about and you

00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,880
can always swing by pound media goblin

00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:53,220
on freenode net if you have like another

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,280
brilliant idea of how to promote to

00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:58,800
centralized services or wanna hack on a

00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:03,530
great Python project and help us build

00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,530
media hosting so thank you very much

01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:49,069
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:51,230
way to better utilize all your resources

01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:54,710
and it makes managing all your resources

01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:58,540
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:00:54,710 --> 01:01:02,030
happening in open source the

01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,859
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,960
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:07,940
these are these you know these these

01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,250
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:13,099
discovered and then fixed is it like

01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:16,099
that really shows the power of the of

01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:18,550
the open source community it is global

01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:22,099
and it's definitely because of the users

01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:28,069
community people are extremely friendly

01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:29,809
and always ready to help if you go on

01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:31,940
tire see any day you'll see these guys

01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:34,640
helping each other out and they're all

01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,319
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,339
product is transparent for everyone

01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:42,530
everyone can look at the code base

01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:44,740
everyone can see how CloudStack is being

01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:50,270
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:52,849
everything is open in many ways it's

01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:57,349
absolutely vital to the the unborn

01:01:52,849 --> 01:02:01,549
health plan staff the most exciting

01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:04,380
event in recent memory for me was our

01:02:01,549 --> 01:02:07,019
first developer boot camp

01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,660
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:13,619
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:17,819
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:20,640
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:23,160
chairs in the room twice everything

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,430
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:29,490
is open source and so I don't think that

01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:31,259
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:34,289
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:02:31,259 --> 01:02:36,839
computing and so i think it's i think

01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:38,339
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:39,480
about cloud computing you're really

01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:45,029
talking about open source cloud

01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:48,059
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:50,190
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:54,450
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:57,150
in each data centers these hardware is

01:02:54,450 --> 01:03:00,630
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:03,329
to handle number one that mass scale

01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:06,509
number two it's designed to handle the

01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:09,029
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:03:06,509 --> 01:03:13,559
deployments we started working on cloud

01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:16,859
tech over four years ago and it was the

01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,630
original set of people working on it had

01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:22,710
a background of delivering software

01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:26,940
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:30,569
lots of users actually using it high

01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:33,660
availability is the key feature multiple

01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:35,670
hypervisors support different network

01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,339
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:40,619
you better while step management server

01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:44,309
can be deployed in different physical

01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:45,960
machines it definitely has a huge

01:03:44,309 --> 01:03:50,940
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:53,519
there's a major movie studio that they

01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:56,819
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:58,799
to transcode video and i thought that

01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:00,450
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:03,720
more fascinating is what they did during

01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:06,509
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,720
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,790
lunch was over they would

01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:13,930
the instances and get back to doing real

01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:15,250
work CloudStack is vast it touches so

01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:17,349
many different aspects and there's no

01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,720
one person that's kind of like a master

01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:23,830
of all those realms I think CloudStack

01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:26,050
as a project is going to be one of the

01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:30,099
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:35,560
most feature fallen and and robust

01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:38,460
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,460
living through the clouds dag

01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:53,339
you

01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:01,700
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:03,680
ago we could not have imagined that

01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,870
asterisk would not only become the most

01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,030
widely adopted open source communication

01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:10,040
software on the planet but that it would

01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:12,560
impact the entire industry in the way

01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:14,570
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,180
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:19,130
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:21,230
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:22,640
transition of power from the hands of

01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,890
the traditional proprietary phone

01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,290
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,240
administrators of phone systems using

01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,470
this power our customers have created

01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,420
all sorts of business changing

01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:34,250
applications from small office phone

01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:36,770
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,390
the international carrier networks in

01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,160
fact there's even an entire country

01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:42,770
those communications infrastructure runs

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,690
on esters the gym has always been about

01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:46,400
creating technology that expands

01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:48,590
communications capabilities in ways that

01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,760
we could never have imagined and that's

01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:52,160
part of what's game-changing about

01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,860
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,960
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:59,060
IP phones this extends control of the

01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,830
user all the way to the desktop the

01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:02,540
launch of these new products represents

01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:04,520
the next phase indigenous history of

01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:07,040
innovation these are the first and only

01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,750
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,310
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:12,350
our expectations for building a family

01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:14,480
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:16,220
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,870
the team to build the phones such that

01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:20,060
they were easy to install integrate

01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:21,890
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:24,470
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:26,090
that goal user feedback is validating

01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:28,220
that when it comes to operation with

01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:30,650
astro space systems including our own

01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:33,200
Switchvox based product these are the

01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:34,520
easiest to use best integrated most

01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,100
interoperable products on the market

01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:39,100
today the digitally phones will

01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,150
initially include three IP des hommes

01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,100
uniquely designed to complement any

01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,960
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:47,630
these phones are different for a number

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,300
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:51,710
designed for use with esters secondly

01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,320
we've made it really easy to

01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:55,730
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,800
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,360
to access information inside of asterisk

01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,360
allowing tight coupling

01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,320
between an application and the phone

01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,480
additionally we've created an

01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,610
applications engine that allows users

01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,850
and developers to create and run their

01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:12,620
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:14,570
done all of this at a very compelling

01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:16,250
price point at digium we're always

01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,350
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:20,870
the best value in business phone systems

01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:22,580
and also give them the power to create

01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,620
their own solutions or eating

01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:26,330
communications challenge will continue

01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,800
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,840
astros cooler bastard more

01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,460
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,920
asterisk and what communications even

01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:37,630
easier and together we'll change the way

01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,630
