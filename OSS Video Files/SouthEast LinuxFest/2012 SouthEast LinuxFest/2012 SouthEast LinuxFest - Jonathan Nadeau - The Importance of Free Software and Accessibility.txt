appreciate you coming and when to learn

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,009
about accessibility and free software as

00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,979
Eric said my name is Jonathan nado i am

00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:32,649
a i'm a father a husband of three

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,899
children i'm also a blind ganool linux

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,990
user and advocate of free software and

00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:39,039
accessibility obviously some of the

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,959
things that I do other than the

00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,959
accessible computing foundation i have a

00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,360
website frostbite media org and i host

00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,789
for podcasts currently on it where one

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,979
is aimed on the android platform and

00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,630
it's called joint nation and we discuss

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,190
routing and robbing android phones and

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,979
taking back control of your devices

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,530
another one is called frost cast where I

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,780
interview project leaders of different

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,429
linux distributions and free software to

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,200
get the word out about their

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,940
distributions and free software projects

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,970
to help encourage people to you know

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,920
maybe help out the project the next is

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,230
this week in fedora which unfortunately

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,120
haven't done in a while but again I

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,739
interview people within the Fedora

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,060
community and we discuss things that's

00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,500
going on the Fedora community different

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,569
projects they're doing within fedora and

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,069
I also do this weekend Debian which is

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,810
obviously just like this weekend fedora

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,400
and also unfortunately haven't done in a

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,180
while but hopefully i'll be picking

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,290
those back up soon as eric also

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,480
mentioned i'm also the executive

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,250
director of the accessible computing

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,989
foundation we'll talk a little bit more

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,959
about that in the middle and towards the

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:43,120
end of the talk some of you may or may

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,540
not know I was not born blind I was in a

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,550
car accident at the age of 14 I could

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,400
see perfectly fine

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,680
till then and the car accident I lost my

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,430
sight in the car accident and I entered

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,020
into the world of accessibility before

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,420
my car accident like most of you

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,340
probably I've never never considered

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,350
accessibility and and how people

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,210
interact with day-to-day things that we

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,340
take for granted and when I talked to

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,890
some people about accessibility I've had

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,240
a few people say that I feel really bad

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,070
I've never even thought of you know

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,230
things like this or issues like this and

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,750
that's fine I mean why would you if you

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,340
don't depend on accessibility and that's

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,570
why I'm here today is to bring awareness

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,600
of free software and accessibility so

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,480
for these next few moments I'd like you

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,570
to walk of me on this trip and let's

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,130
just say that on you wake up and you

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,420
can't see let's say you go to sleep one

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,690
morning and you wake up and now you

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,100
can't see I'm just choosing you waking

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,570
up and not seeing because obviously I

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,750
have a little experience with this I

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,360
myself one day was asleep and woke up

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,610
and couldn't see again so let's join me

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,989
on this endeavor and so let's imagine

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,140
you've fallen asleep you wick you've

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:58,260
woken up and you can't see you've just

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,790
joined 360 million people around the

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,320
world that have a vision impairment

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,030
you're one of three hundred sixty

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,970
million people now in the world that

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,500
have some type of vision impairment this

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,209
is a good chance that you're in the

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,560
ninety percent bracket of blind people

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,500
throughout the world that live in

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,750
developing countries but for the sake of

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,959
this discussion let's assume you live in

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,570
the United States now putting aside your

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,620
day-to-day routines and lino discussing

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,330
how would you deal with those things

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,720
let's look at the technology side of

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,130
things that you do what would you do

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,110
about your technology how are you going

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,880
to check your email how are you going to

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,590
read your RSS feeds and catch up on the

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,750
news for the day how are you going to

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,250
log in and and chat with one of your

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,140
friends online how are you going to

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,000
access your social network and talk with

00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,919
your friends and put up pictures of your

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,330
friends and family how will you access

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,510
these things now that you can no longer

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,800
see so again like I said let's assume

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,380
that you live in the in the united

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,729
states this is a good chance if you're

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,080
living in the united states in your

00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,160
vision impaired blind or low vision

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,630
there's a good

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,830
you're in the seventy to eighty percent

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:09,390
bracket of people that are unemployed so

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,890
if you're in Lynn the United States

00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,880
you're in this bracket of seventy to

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,950
eighty percent of people that are

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,900
unemployed it looks like you're going to

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,130
need an assistive technology what are

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,570
you going to do now now before we get

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,340
too far too much farther into the

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,590
discussion i'll discuss a little bit of

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,820
what assistive technology is some of you

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,190
may or may not know i'm going to run

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,420
through a few free software programs and

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,210
what they can do and how they can help

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,970
out people with disabilities not just

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,350
blind and low-vision so the first one is

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,820
he work a screen reader which is what

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,160
i'm using right now that's why i have a

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,810
headphone in my ear basically the orca

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,640
screen reader allows me to navigate my

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,220
computer I can tab an arrow through the

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,350
genome desktop i can write documents and

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,110
take notes i can go online i can send

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:55,070
emails i can hop in the IRC and chat the

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,470
people i can basically do everything

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,450
that a sighted person can do short of

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,300
editing a video or maybe fixing up some

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,280
pictures oh and also i forgot to

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,320
apologize I don't have any slides you

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,820
probably wouldn't appreciate my artistic

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:14,340
ability so and there's also a program

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,290
called Dasher which is a on-screen

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,419
keyboard this is good for people to have

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,400
low motor skills with their hands I

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,200
can't really use the keyboard that well

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,910
they could use a mouse and it gives them

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,890
an on-screen keyboard with big letters

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,900
and they can either use the mouse or

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,280
like a trackball and drag it over the

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,290
screen and click on the letters that way

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,120
it's a you know a lot more useful for

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,030
someone I can't really get their hands

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,520
on the keyboard and really be proficient

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,840
with it so the next one this one's

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,000
really interesting and intrigues me a

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,550
lot is called mouse trap what this

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,740
allows you to do is this is great for a

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,690
person that has no control from the neck

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,730
down of their by a paraplegic in a

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,430
wheelchair you can plug in a common

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,590
webcam and mouse trap will track the eye

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,200
movement of the person in the wheelchair

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,690
and it will move the cursor and you can

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,460
set the timing of the cursor so when the

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,650
person drags the cursor say over like

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,500
Firefox when they stop their eyes and

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,760
stop moving mouse trap knows oh they

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,710
want me to click on this and it will

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,870
open and they can navigate the computer

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,340
just with the movement

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,900
their eyes they could also use the

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,260
on-screen keyboard Dasher like I just

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,570
spoke of this project isn't extremely

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,990
mature but this is one of the goals of

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:26,090
the foundation is to take donations from

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,950
people individuals or and/or companies

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,080
and we are going to hire developers to

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,840
improve the software make it better and

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,700
the end goal is for people that depend

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,620
on assistive technology to use free

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,040
software and we'll get into the reasons

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,860
of more why that's good and the last one

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,360
I mentioned is one called Simon actually

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,260
have two more these two are kind of the

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,360
same Simon is in the KDE platform but

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,900
can also be loaded into genome this

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,610
allows voice control you're able to

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,660
manipulate the computer with voice

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,910
control I know it's the latest KDE 4.8 I

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,650
believe they have Simon installed by

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,560
default and you can actually play a

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,380
chess game just by your voice now again

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,720
this is a not completely mature software

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,970
but the possibilities are there to

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,580
extend that out so people instead of

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,410
having to even track the software with

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,090
their eyes are move that move the track

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,370
around with their eyes they can control

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:26,600
with their voice the next one is fedex

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:29,780
it's ve d ICS and this is a lot like

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,630
Simon unfortunately I think this project

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,170
might not be doing much right now it was

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,280
working really well under genome 2x

00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,870
they'd have there's quite a few videos

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,940
on youtube if you search for it where

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,370
they'll say if you're familiar with

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,870
genome they'll say applications it'll

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,570
pull up the applications and they'll say

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,910
Firefox and I'll open up Firefox and he

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,630
can actually go from link to link using

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,670
his voice commands he could open up I at

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,400
the time most open office but Libre

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,430
writer and you know he could dictate a

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,710
document he could open up on some music

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,120
fast-forward rewind it stop it skipped

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,230
in the next track I was really

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,150
impressive stuff but I think

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,250
unfortunately the develop on this might

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,080
have slowed down quite a bit and again

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,040
we're we're interested in picking this

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,870
project back up so those are some of the

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,370
of what assistive technology can do for

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,010
people what free software can do for

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,930
people before I get too much deeper into

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,720
the importance of free software I'd like

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,850
to

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,100
show you the other side of this and

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,439
proprietary assistive technology to

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,089
really show you why free software is

00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:35,399
important for people that depend on

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,689
assistive technology and I'll try it I

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,129
don't want to hammer on this too much

00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,500
but I do need to make some of these

00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,660
points so summers you understand kind of

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,889
what goes on in the assistive technology

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,029
world if you don't experience it

00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:49,470
yourself there's a few proprietary

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,360
screen readers that work on Windows I'm

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,560
going to choose one called jaws because

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,379
that's kind of like the de facto

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,060
standard basically anytime someone

00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,149
recommends a screen reader to a blind or

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,790
low vision user or if they're able to

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:05,220
get assistance to purchase a screamer

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,509
pretty much it's always jaws so we're

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,610
just going to stick with jaws for the

00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:10,860
sake of this discussion it's made by a

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,930
company called Freedom Scientific which

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,850
is kind of funny because they don't give

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:20,670
you any freedom at all but so um let's

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,709
see here sorry I skipped ahead of myself

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,870
here okay so let in the beginning we

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,189
discussed that you woke up you're blind

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,079
there's a good chance you're in the

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:29,399
seventy to eighty percent of blind

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,889
people in the united states that are

00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,290
unemployed and you need assistive

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,509
technology this is where Freedom

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,550
Scientific is interesting and comes into

00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,930
play because you'd figure Freedom

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,509
Scientific would have done their work

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,800
and realized that seventy to eighty

00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:47,160
percent of blind and low-vision users

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,290
are living on a low income like a fixed

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,610
income and so they're not getting much

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,930
money so you figured they would know

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,910
their target they would know their their

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,069
target they would understand you know

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,300
what's going on there they have come up

00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:00,809
with a price point of twelve hundred

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,850
dollars so in order for a blind person

00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,860
or a low vision users so in order for

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,230
you that woke up to access your computer

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,329
you're unemployed and you need twelve

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,339
hundred dollars to access your computer

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:14,670
I'm assuming yours in Windows here in

00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,990
this discussion sorry so you need to pay

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,910
twelve hundred dollars to access your

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,949
computer to check your email to send

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,990
your instant message and to you know get

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,610
on your social networks even then it's

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,990
not a hundred percent accessible I mean

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,180
unfortunately nothing is at this point

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,490
but so you need twelve hundred dollars

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,529
and Freedom Scientific sells these

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,689
things like gangbusters because here's

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:37,529
the problem they get the government to

00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:38,190
pay for people to use jaws so I would

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,170
have to go to the

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,170
government and say you know can I please

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,000
get this assistance I need to you know

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,650
use my computer and there's some

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,930
stipulations to this you either need to

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,450
be a student or you need to have a job

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,830
and so only you know twenty to thirty

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,380
percent of blind and low-vision users

00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,060
have a job and most blind and low-vision

00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,610
people are students until high school

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,790
and then that's a lot of us don't go to

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:05,670
higher education on this is a very big

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,200
loophole there and sometimes even if you

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,420
do qualify there might not be enough

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,620
funding and where you are and they are

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,800
not going to be able to purchase it for

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,080
you so this is quite the quandary here

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,210
and I'm not focusing on just price we'll

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,890
get into actual freedom but this is this

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:24,480
is one of the hurdles for a blind and

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:27,150
low-vision user so let's say that I you

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,120
know I do get a copy of Jaws I'm all

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,040
happy yes I can access my computer

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,260
everything is great well this is where

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,430
proprietary software is bad because my

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,020
friend doesn't qualify for Jaws he's and

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,370
I want him to be able to access his

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,290
computer I want him to be able to send

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,670
emails I wanted to be able to you know

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,920
connect with people across the world

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,420
over the over the internet and I can

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,610
have to tell my friend I'm sorry I can't

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,110
share this with you this is the license

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,140
will not allow me to share this with you

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,540
and so I have to I have to either obey

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,550
the license and and you know hurt my

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,760
friend's feelings or I can break the

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,890
license and help my friend out so I have

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,470
to obey the license and not share the

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:11,400
software with him and leave him in the

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,500
dark so to speak so another thing about

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,260
the proprietary software is jaws gives

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,750
you three installs on Windows you and I

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,270
know you install windows probably more

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,890
than three times in a year so do do you

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,080
know viruses and other things and that

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,360
that break once those three installs are

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,190
over you need to re-up your licenses

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,870
it's known as much as the original

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,460
twelve hundred dollars but they still

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,620
make you pay for it so you have to

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,080
either go back and try to get more

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,700
assistance to get new licenses or you

00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,810
need to find a way to come up with it

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,670
might be five or six hundred dollars

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,940
like I I don't remember i haven't used

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,430
jaws in like five years now um but so

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,080
they keep you locked in and you know

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,460
blind and low-vision users are taking

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,430
advantage of with this whole this whole

00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,120
system

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,670
um let's see is in like I said before

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,550
the cost is not the main focus here

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,990
there is an actual GPL screen reader

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:07,000
called NVDA and it's good that they GPL

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,580
the screen reader the bad thing is that

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,520
this G peeled screen reader is on top of

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,040
a proprietary operating system and to me

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,320
that it's not acceptable I mean I'm glad

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,149
that they're producing GPL software but

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,350
it's not really of any use if it's still

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,480
running on a proprietary operating

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,010
system where they're still held at the

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,660
whims of the operating system that

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,190
they're running under so they can change

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,050
anything at any time they want and

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,670
completely break the screen reader and

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,740
then they have to go back and try and

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,360
fix it and and then whoever is depending

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,370
on this screen reader no longer has

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,459
access to their computer because now the

00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:44,880
whole system is broken so it's it's good

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:47,170
but it's not the ideal situation so

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:55,209
let's see sorry jumped ahead of myself

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:57,339
here so why so why is free software you

00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,380
know so important to all of this well of

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,330
course the four freedoms that come with

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,470
free software and we're going to run

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,330
through some of these freedoms and

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,339
you'll see why these are important and

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,700
how they can affect people across the

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,709
world these four freedoms well freedom

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,740
freedom too is I can help my neighbor

00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:17,020
just like my friend with trying to give

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,029
him the copy of Jaws I can give him a

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,040
copy of canoe Linux with the Orca screen

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,779
reader on it and give him a copy and he

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,459
can install on his computer and he can

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,380
now access his computer access

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,240
technology be able to access the

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,920
Internet he could possibly get a job

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,810
because that's another thing a lot of

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,150
people don't want to hire blind and

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,829
low-vision users because they're told

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,600
okay well if you hire this individual

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,339
now you need to pay you know twelve

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
fifteen hundred dollars extra for some

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,060
software and then they just want to have

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,680
to deal with that so a lot of employers

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,529
will find other reasons not to hire

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,420
blind and low-vision users and it's just

00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,730
a shame so if they have free software

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,980
that that barrier is now gone there's no

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:57,190
need for additional expense for your

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,440
employee and in not only connection air

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,350
with my neighbor but he may have 10 or

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,570
12 other blind friends or maybe he goes

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,260
to a blind computer user group he can

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,180
hand out these

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,120
and give everybody access to the

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,140
technology and it's free software and

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,470
we're going to see more of these

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:19,510
benefits so so freedom zero is having

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,640
control over your computer and running

00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,950
the software as you wish this is also

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,940
another great example of free software

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,040
because some of you may use comp is well

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,350
there's actually a magnifier in comp is

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,330
that a lot of low vision users actually

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,730
use that for magnification of the screen

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,260
and it works fantastic not that the

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,270
people that created compiz had that in

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,790
mind when they did it but it works great

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,210
and it's a great solution there are

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,400
there is basically one de facto

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,230
magnification software for Windows and I

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,200
want to say it's called zoomtext and

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,240
that i believe is nine hundred dollars

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,430
so if they install free software they

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,720
have a freak magnification as just as

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:04,180
comparable as a nine hundred dollar

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,560
piece of proprietary software and like I

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,420
mentioned before unlike the non-free

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,589
assistive technology you can install as

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,020
many times as you want there's no

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,850
licensing fees and you can like I said

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,079
hand out copies you could have two

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,000
thousand computers in your house and

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,280
install as many times this you want and

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,339
that's what's great about free software

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:28,000
and leveraging accessibility on top of

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:29,800
free software so freedom zero isn't just

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,990
isn't enough to gain complete control of

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,720
your computer you also need freedom one

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,110
you may look at the source code study it

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,540
and modify it this also I'm hoping will

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,490
encourage blind and low-vision users to

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,860
be able to look at source code and study

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,500
it and they could hopefully either teach

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,020
themselves to start programming or the

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,550
foundation is actually looking at

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,340
starting up programming classes for free

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,080
to train blind and low-vision users and

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,030
any other person with a type of

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,500
disability that would like to learn how

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,220
to program and this could potentially

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,230
give them a job also the great thing I

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,120
great example I like about being able to

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,660
modify the code is some of you I'm sure

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,670
heard of tux paint well one day there's

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,760
a mother that had an autistic child and

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,830
he loved to use tux paint the problem

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,909
was is he was printing more that he was

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,590
changing the

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:22,299
he was doing on the screen so you would

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,039
he would make one little change and then

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:25,479
print and run to the printer they make

00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,419
one little change print and run to the

00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:30,729
printer and so the mother actually

00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:32,769
contact the developer of tux paint and

00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,720
explain to him what was happening she

00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:37,450
you know she said my son's autistic and

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,950
he keeps clicking the print button every

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,629
time he makes one little change is there

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,729
something you know we could do to to

00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:45,359
alleviate that and what was great that

00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:47,799
the developer did is he put in a

00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,559
basically a flag where if you click

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,599
print it'll wait two minutes before it

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,609
allowed a print again so that way

00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,139
personable could click print print print

00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:57,909
print but nothing would come out until

00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:00,249
that two minutes duration was over and

00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,840
that's just awesome that hey you can

00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:03,999
contact the developer and he's willing

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,649
to do something like that and be you can

00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:07,629
change the source code the free software

00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:09,309
allows you to make this change and then

00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,570
he distributed that change when he

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:13,479
really whenever he pushed out the new

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,950
update and so that's another great thing

00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,929
about assistive technology and free

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,970
software we can make changes quickly and

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,429
everyone will benefit from them whether

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,440
you might need it now or later or not at

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,700
all but someone else I'm sure is going

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,590
to benefit from this change down the

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,859
road so freedom three I just kind of

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:35,349
touched on is being able to distribute

00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,359
modified code the example I like to use

00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:39,759
about this is I in turn at the Free

00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,830
Software Foundation last summer and I

00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,049
reached out to ruben rodriguez who is

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,899
the project leader of a cannula linux

00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:49,479
distribution called triskele and he's

00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:52,539
based tris Kellis based off of ubuntu

00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:54,700
and a bunt to does have an accessibility

00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:58,389
installer in it they don't take

00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,340
advantage of it and it's not easily not

00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,989
you're not able to access it easily and

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,419
actually start the accessible installer

00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:06,279
which is kind of odd so I reached out

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:08,080
the rumor to explain to him that he's

00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,989
using the ubiquity installer and that

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,320
has an accessibility install feature in

00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:16,479
it and we started looking through the

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,119
options that we had and Ruben came up

00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:22,389
with a brilliant idea and so basically

00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:26,349
what he did is he when you drop it in at

00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:28,089
risk eldest that the latest 5.5 and you

00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,799
dropped the disk in and ask for your

00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:31,869
language what language did you want to

00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,710
choose well if you choose the language

00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,059
and a site

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,770
person obviously he's going to click on

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,539
the language it'll just go through the

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,090
Installer normal you'll never even know

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:42,970
it has an accessible installer but if a

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,919
blind person puts in the CD it's going

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,630
to sit up that window and he or she

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,220
isn't going to click on it and it's just

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,409
going to automatically start and load

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,330
into a live session when the live

00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:54,309
session comes up the Orca screen reader

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,929
is automatically running and you can

00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,539
click on the install button and walk the

00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:00,789
install process so i can install this

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,740
distribution completely by myself with

00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:04,570
no cited help at all and it which gives

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,340
me again another type of complete

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,289
freedom and not having to depend on

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,740
somebody to help me out install windows

00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:14,559
and help me install jaws or whatever so

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,210
this has given a freedom to blind and

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,240
low-vision users and another type of

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,600
freedom and the effects that this can

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,520
have that Reuben did with Driscoll is he

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,490
made the international version with the

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,740
accessible installer so we can start

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,330
letting these developing countries the

00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,600
ninety percent of blind people in these

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,870
developing countries that you can get

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,220
get access to this free software and

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,380
triska will run on pretty low-end

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,570
harbour which is great so they could get

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,360
this burn a disc or find a way to get a

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,399
disc and they could start access

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,440
accessing technology getting on the

00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,539
internet and coming into a world that

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,390
they knew never knew existed they could

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,679
that they themselves could maybe find a

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,200
job in the town that they live in if

00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,760
they're they have enough energy they

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,159
could try and start their own business

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,080
they could they could even start a

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,500
service with tech support built around

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,480
triskele or built around orca within

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,370
within their like town or nation that

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,679
they live in this is going to give many

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,289
opportunities to people around the world

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,270
just from this one change being made on

00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,940
the operating system and if this one

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,620
change can have such an impact there can

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,820
be much greater impact with the

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,890
foundation and the work that we're

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,840
trying to do my end goal at the

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,210
foundation as the executive director is

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,789
for anyone that has any type of

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,399
disability to completely depend on free

00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,380
software because once we build the free

00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:40,360
software and there's a community built

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,980
around it more people will contribute to

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,630
these projects more people will

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,669
contribute to spreading the word about

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,029
the accessible computing Foundation and

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,700
the work

00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:50,159
we're trying to do our our tagline is we

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,469
want to bridge the gap between

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,739
technology and accessibility the faster

00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:58,989
technology moves the faster

00:22:55,739 --> 00:23:01,479
accessibility is left behind and it's a

00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:02,950
sad thing but I'm hoping with free

00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:05,200
software we can catch up with the

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,059
technology that's moving we can program

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,830
quickly we can make changes quickly we

00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,830
can add stuff to what we're working on

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,479
quickly and we're not just

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,029
focusing on blind and low-vision like I

00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:18,729
said we want to help with dash or we

00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:20,369
want to help with mouse trap there's

00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:22,899
people with learning disabilities that

00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:25,809
I've heard someone tell me the other day

00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:27,749
that they'll turn on festival which is

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:30,460
sort of a screen reader but not really

00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:32,019
but they'll open up a text file and have

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,909
festival read it because they have a

00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,320
problem if they're just reading a page

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:37,059
with words on it but when they hear

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,039
festival reading it as they're reading

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,389
it it helps them you know the

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,460
information to sink into them a little

00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:44,919
bit better so there's lots of things we

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,929
can do a free software and accessibility

00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,330
and like I said we're not just focusing

00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:51,369
on blind and low-vision it's paraplegics

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,129
and people in wheelchairs learning

00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:56,289
disabilities dyslexia whatever we can do

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,669
to bridge the gap between technology and

00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,219
accessibility that's what we want to do

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:03,669
we want to get free assistive technology

00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:04,989
on hardware devices the other day on our

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,629
way down here we stopped at like a

00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:09,099
convenience store and the only way to

00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:11,589
order a sandwich what's use this

00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:13,599
touchscreen and I was like if I was by

00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:16,119
myself right now I wouldn't even be able

00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,190
to order this sandwich now all it would

00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,869
need is just I'm sure that has the

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,779
capabilities built into it all we need

00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:24,399
is a synthesizer and that's another

00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:26,559
project we're working on is building a

00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:28,989
free implementation of voice modeling

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,029
where you know you might hear the iphone

00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:33,099
talk or other devices talk there's

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,950
licensing fees with that there's

00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:37,749
licensing costs with that so the ATM and

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,830
this you know this little thing to order

00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:41,710
your sandwich they're not going to pay

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,419
you know 10 20 30 50 dot whatever the

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,039
licensing fee is you know that going to

00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:47,169
pay that more on top of whatever it

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,210
costs to make the device but if we make

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:51,039
a free implementation of voice modeling

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,149
there's no reason everything should be

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,489
able to talk there should be no reason

00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:56,019
at that point for every device not to

00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:58,440
talk because there's no more licensing

00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:00,720
fee there's no more extra cost on

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,149
vendors building these products so we'll

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:13,620
be able to get over that hurdle and so

00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:18,750
let's see okay sorry I jumped way out of

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:20,759
myself again and back back to ruben and

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,490
this is an interesting point that he

00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:26,429
made and obviously and talks to them a

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,649
lot now i spoke at libre planet which is

00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:30,809
a the free software foundation's

00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:33,570
conference and I was talking about free

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:36,179
software accessibility there and Ruben

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:39,480
got up and pointed out that the changes

00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,549
that he made wasn't even hard he said he

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,789
said once you brought to my attention he

00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:46,649
said he said I had it done in 10 minutes

00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:50,070
he said a lot of accessibility is not

00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:52,409
hard people like he encouraged the

00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,210
programmers there to take the extra 20

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:56,399
minutes to look through your software

00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,190
and to see if there's a few things you

00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,809
can do to make orca be able to read the

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,789
menu is to make or kabil to read the

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,220
buttons he said it's not hard he said a

00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:06,480
lot of problems could be fixed within 20

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,399
minutes or half an hour's work with a

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,809
lot of free software projects if they

00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,700
just took the time to comb through their

00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:13,379
code and it would just become accessible

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,210
he said there's not going to be a lot of

00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:17,940
extra work for these things to become

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,250
accessible and he just wanted to point

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,200
out that if more people would take the

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,909
extra 20 minutes 30 minutes to look at

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,549
things they're doing a lot more stuff

00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:28,110
could become accessible and that's the

00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,240
fact that's the goal of the foundation

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,070
is due to bring awareness and to point

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,250
out these things that companies could do

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,200
one of our board members isn't up and

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,129
get in contact with VMware and he's

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,470
really encouraging them to make their

00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:44,820
virtualization software accessible

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,470
granted that's probably proprietary but

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,419
we're not going to be actually building

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,889
any code for that but he's putting

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,509
pressure on them to make the

00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:53,429
virtualization software accessible

00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,899
because there are blind system

00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,149
administrators and they can't access

00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:59,309
this stuff and the more everything's

00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,870
going virtualized the more these system

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,730
admins are being left behind because

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,860
they can't access the virtualization

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,210
software that vmware is putting out so

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,860
that's another thing that the foundation

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,820
is looking at doing is you know speaking

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,530
with companies and pointing out like

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,510
you know it'd be great if you could make

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,640
this accessible because I also forgot to

00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,140
mention not only their 360 million blind

00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,540
people low vision people in the world

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,880
add it on top of that wall including

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,580
that there are 1 billion people in the

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,890
world with some type of disability so if

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,080
more people focused on making things

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,360
accessible in some way shape or form

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,520
there's a billion more people that could

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,950
be using their product or buying their

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,590
product or using their software or

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,690
whatever there's a whole untapped market

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,820
of people that can't access technology

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,160
that want to access technology but have

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,480
no way to do it and so that's again

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,390
that's what I'll do it the foundation is

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,130
bridge that gap and let those billion

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,200
people access the technology that's

00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,270
flying around them left right and center

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,490
and they can't enjoy any of it because

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,580
it's not taking into consideration when

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:02,590
these products are made so again the

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,470
foundation is accessible computing

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,750
foundation org we do have like

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,250
memberships if you wanted to pay two

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,110
dollars ten dollars or twenty dollars

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,750
you can become a member when you become

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:17,050
a member you also get a freedom male co

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,820
email address so you could be your

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,430
initial of your first name and last name

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,070
at freedom male co when you become a

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:27,280
member and you get that we we say that

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,900
it's a web mail that doesn't you know we

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,250
respect your privacy and no one's

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,110
reading your email and sending you ads

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,120
this you can access it through the web

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,160
there's a web you can also access

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,070
through imap and pop and all that stuff

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,630
so on if you become a member that's one

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,180
of the benefits to get become a member

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:47,830
and you can also make just a one-time

00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:49,120
donation if you'd like and so those were

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,560
some of the goals that were doing really

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,690
our first goal is to make the free

00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,010
software voice modeler because I I

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,740
believe that was going to have the most

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,390
impact right away if you hurt Walker

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,790
right now it sounds like a robot from

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,680
like the 1980s it you know I myself

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,060
don't care it's not hurdle to me but

00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,790
there are some blind people that are

00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,470
using Mac's or using Windows and

00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,420
unfortunately you know they license out

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,820
the better sounding voices that

00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,740
practically sound human and when they

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,660
hear orca and you know linux are just

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,700
like oh man that's that's like taking a

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,780
step back 20 years they they don't want

00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,960
to put up with that and I equate that to

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,600
you know there are some people

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,340
want that nice shiny desktop with all

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,960
the bling and the effects and there are

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,940
some people that could care less well

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,140
you know the the blind individuals that

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,370
want the really good sounding voice

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,870
they're the ones that want the blingy

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:38,330
desktop with all the effects and the

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,770
voices just sounds so much better so if

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,410
we make the free implementation of the

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,690
voice modeler then that will be one less

00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:46,400
barrier to getting more people the more

00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,520
blind and low-vision users using free

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,600
software and so that like I said that's

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,590
the main goal and then those are some of

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,070
the things that we're looking at the

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,870
future working with KDE xfce hopefully

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,230
trying to do things with an Android I

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,570
reached out to Tyson and ask them about

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,280
their accessibility because I'd love to

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,470
get in on the ground floor at Tyson and

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,330
not have to bolt on accessibility once

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,040
it's fully baked I mean still being

00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,340
worked on so I've reached out to them

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,500
where discussions with them thankfully i

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,990
live near boston and they said they're

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,050
basing their accessibility off the w3c

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,790
standards and the office is rain Boston

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,050
so I might have to be taking a trip down

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,240
there at some point and speaking with

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,910
him about accessibility and seeing what

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,170
we can do so I thank you for your

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,360
interest and free software and

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,670
accessibility thank you for listening to

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,800
the talk and I can take any questions if

00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,870
anyone has any questions about you know

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,530
some of the goals we have or if you have

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:47,530
any questions about accessibility at all

00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,530
should

00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:10,320
you mean as far as killing search engine

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:13,140
optimization yeah I would say like

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,070
accessibility assistive technology maybe

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,140
would be a good one accessible software

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:23,090
you know something along those lines

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,090
would be people would find your page

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,510
just

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,030
yeah that's that's an illegal we're

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,190
trying to do it the foundation is where

00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,410
with Reuben we're trying to build a

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,330
framework deferred distributions and

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,970
software developers to show them like if

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,350
you follow these steps like there's a

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,730
goodness like a ninety-five percent

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,800
chance it's going to be accessible

00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,170
without you having to bang your head

00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,720
against the wall so there's there's

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,400
simple processes that you can follow

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,740
that just by default it'll become

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,510
accessible so it won't be painstaking

00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,640
for developers so we're trying to create

00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,010
pages like that that show developers

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,630
like you know look if you're in gtk you

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,460
know in this field here this will make

00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,860
the button accessible you know label

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,240
your buttons properly so you know blind

00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,980
and low-vision users will be able to see

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,470
what the buttons labeled as because

00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,270
sometimes it'll just say like icon you

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,530
know it's like well what's icon you know

00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,790
then you have to like click on it be

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,220
like okay that's not what I wanted the

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,720
next one says icon and you know so it's

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,440
just little things like that make all

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,440
the difference in the world

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,460
yes I'm glad you mentioned that and I

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,200
actually skipped over it cuz I wasn't

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,260
sure if I'd be interested in there is a

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,540
program called exerciser and you can run

00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,059
your your program through exerciser and

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,500
it's not one hundred percent but it'll

00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:11,110
give you a really good idea of what's

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,490
accessible and what is it so it's called

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,510
exercise and i believe it's spelled

00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,470
correctly i don't think they have a

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,470
funny spelling on it

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:37,519
mmm so do you have funny stories to tell

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:40,279
about gnome 3 it took a hit on 30 you

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,169
know I was still using 2 and X 3 dot it

00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:44,600
sort of worked but I mean we're not

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:45,830
really like it wasn't you could use it

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,989
if you wanted like if you're trying to

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,309
test and you know file bugs but really

00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:52,460
the average person was going to use it

00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:53,899
32 was leaps and bounds way but you

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,090
could it was definitely usable at three

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:59,509
dot 2 and 3 dot 4 is quite impressive

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,279
i'm i'm on 32 right now but i installed

00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:03,559
fedora 17 and i've been running through

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,299
three dot 4 on photo or 17 and it's

00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,669
fantastic they've worked out a lot of

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:09,109
the kind of I don't know how to describe

00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:10,970
because I've never seen it I think up

00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,440
near like the activities thing this is

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,480
kind of like the applets or icons up

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,790
there all that stuff is accessible now

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,069
so it's pretty much 100 100 percent

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:28,549
accessible now so they worked a lot of

00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:31,460
the bugs out pretty quickly it I guess

00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:33,440
it depends because if you use genome 3

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,030
in a fallback mode which is what true

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,129
scale does and which is what i'm using

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,690
right now they put it in fallback mode

00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:41,480
because they don't want you to have to

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,040
install proprietary video drivers when

00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,950
it's in a fallback mode it looks a lot

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,329
like get home to like a blind person if

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,309
you didn't tell me they were in good old

00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,960
three they would probably just assume

00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:56,780
it's going home too because it looks

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:59,030
just like it but well no yeah i mean the

00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,040
functionality is all the same if it's in

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,630
fallback mode but if it's in the if

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,829
you're in the genome shell it yeah it's

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,990
definitely different because then you

00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:08,930
got to start using the super key to pull

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,220
up the launcher and so some of the key

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,500
commands are a little bit different to

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,569
navigate the desktop but I mean Orca and

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,569
everything still runs the same so

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:31,960
so far yes no the I'd rather not talk

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:33,549
about it but let's just say Ubuntu

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,079
wasn't too concerned about accessibility

00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:41,529
when they pulled out when they started

00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:44,260
unity so they have a they have a little

00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:46,750
bit i'm really looking forward to qt5

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,510
dunno because they're really opening up

00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:52,990
accessibility on that release so once

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:55,630
qt5 ponen comes out i think almost by

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,039
default everything in using the QT 50

00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,710
libraries are going to be accessible

00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,329
which is pretty exciting so right now

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,450
there's a thing that's been developed

00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:06,819
called there's a thing called the 80

00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:10,089
dash spi bridge well what they did is

00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:13,240
they made a cutie ati spi bridge which

00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:16,240
bridges the Qt framework over to the at

00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,920
speed bridge and some stuff is

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,910
accessible already just from that

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,460
without the 50 libraries coming out so

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:29,859
hopefully when kaydee 50 comes that will

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:31,890
be extremely accessible and all sorry go

00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:31,890
ahead

00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,330
linux compared with firefox

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,070
accessibility in Windows I haven't used

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,410
windows in five years I can tell you but

00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,200
fire Firefox now it has been the best

00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:48,120
it's ever been in my opinion so like on

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,030
12 or 13 what everyone right now it's

00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,030
been great unfortunately with web

00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,710
browsers the well I take that Firefox

00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,690
really is the only accessible one right

00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,800
now chrome is completely inaccessible

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,810
anything in WebKit is inaccessible

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,060
except for the epiphany web browser is

00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:10,070
in WebKit and they made a library called

00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:12,840
I think it's called WebKit gtk+ and that

00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,730
makes epiphany accessible but other than

00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,130
that there's no other accessible

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,330
browsers outside of like like a-- links

00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:24,840
or links if you're you know in the

00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:27,300
command line that works but what I would

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,340
use a lynx or links but the problem is

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,390
is they don't support like JavaScript so

00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:35,370
if you're trying to log into a website

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:36,360
it doesn't work so yeah yeah so it's a

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,560
little I mean if you want to do

00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,300
something really quick and you'll need

00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,840
to log it anywhere I mean it flies and

00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,070
it works well but yeah you couldn't

00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,320
actually like if you want to like you

00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,640
know do social networking or like I said

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:57,180
anywhere we have to actually log into

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:59,310
something it doesn't work yeah oh and

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,760
back to the like accessible desktops

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:05,070
xfce just released for 10 and they had

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,590
been working with orca and so they've

00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,900
done a lot of work to I apparently make

00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,920
this release extremely except i don't

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,400
know if i should say extremely

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,720
accessible but very accessible and i'm

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,600
running that i haven't figured out how

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,390
to exactly get it working great but i'm

00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,510
excited to see xfc because orca works

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,780
really well with gtk and xfce obviously

00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,130
is in gtk so there I've been pushing for

00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,270
like a year now like there really

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,160
shouldn't be much work to get this

00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,130
working and so I got work at a talk to

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,400
xfce xfce actually made a accessibility

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:40,560
mailing list and so they they've been

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,960
working on making work a break away from

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,640
being tired in to know them so much and

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,090
so that's what's helping it work with

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,160
xfce better so

00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,800
within the next six months and once like

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,440
fedora and want to release with 410

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,170
because unfortunately xfce released like

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,570
a few weeks after the main distros the

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,580
release their distro so that for dot 8

00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,920
is still in you know ubuntu and fedora

00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,050
and stuff so in september-october i'm

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:19,740
going to be excited to see how well the

00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:19,740
accessibility is working xfce is that it

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,220
all right thank you

00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:44,040
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,200
way to better utilize all your resources

00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,650
and it makes managing all your resources

00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,480
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:57,000
happening in open source the

00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,770
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,720
of the community and then the speed at

00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,910
which these are these you know these

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,220
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,800
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,530
that really shows the power of the you

00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,150
know of the open source community it is

00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:16,350
global and it's definitely because of

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:22,680
the users community people are extremely

00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:24,570
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,880
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,610
guys helping each other out and they're

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,290
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:34,280
the product is transparent for everyone

00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:37,230
everyone can look at the code base

00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,970
everyone can see how close that is is

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:44,820
being built nothing nothing is

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:47,460
proprietary everything is open in many

00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,660
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:55,410
ongoing health CloudStack the most

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:59,360
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:02,000
was our first developer boot camp

00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,640
and our call gave people a gave me two

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,600
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:12,770
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:15,620
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,140
chairs in the room twice everything

00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:21,380
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,440
is open source and so I don't think that

00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,210
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,240
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,790
computing and so i think it's i think

00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,320
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:37,030
about cloud computing you're really

00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,030
talking about it source cloud computing

00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:43,370
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:45,770
deployments you have dozens of data

00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:49,790
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:53,060
data centers these hardware is going to

00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:56,270
fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:58,730
handle number one that mass scale number

00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,460
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:04,010
that inevitably happens in large

00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,550
deployments started working on college

00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:10,880
attack over four years ago and it was

00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,580
the original set of people working on it

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,690
had a background of delivering software

00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:21,920
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:25,520
lots of users actually using it high

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,610
availability is the key feature multiple

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,620
hypervisors support different network

00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:33,320
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,570
you better while step management server

00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,260
can be deployed in different physical

00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:40,910
machines it definitely has a huge

00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:45,890
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:48,470
there's a major movie studio that they

00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:51,770
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,750
to transcode video and i thought that

00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,400
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:58,670
more fascinating is what they did during

00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,460
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,960
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,450
much was over they would destroy all the

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,720
instance

00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:09,360
compact to doing real work CloudStack is

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,100
vast it touches so many different

00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,900
aspects and there's no one person that's

00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,290
kind of like a master of all those

00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,440
realms I think CloudStack as a project

00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,720
is going to be one of the leaders simply

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,520
because it's some of the most feature

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:30,840
pulling and and robust platforms out

00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,410
they were out on senior living through

00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,410
the clouds dag

00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,260
you

00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,410
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,630
ago we could not have imagined that

00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:00,820
asterisk would not only become the most

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,980
widely adopted open source communication

00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,020
software on the planet but that it would

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,540
impact the entire industry in the way

00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,490
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,130
way into more than 170 countries and

00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:14,110
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,180
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,590
transition of power from the hands of

00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,869
the traditional proprietary phone

00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,270
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,190
administrators of phone systems using

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,420
this power our customers have created

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,369
all sorts of business changing

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,230
applications from small office phone

00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:31,720
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,340
the international carrier networks in

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,140
fact there's even an entire country

00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,720
those communications infrastructure runs

00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,640
on esters the gym has always been about

00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,350
creating technology that expands

00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,540
communications capabilities in ways that

00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,740
we could never have imagined and that's

00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,110
part of what's game-changing about

00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,810
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:51,910
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,040
IP phones that extends control of the

00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,780
user all the way to the desktop the

00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,490
launch of these new products represents

00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,470
the next phase indigenous history of

00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,990
innovation these are the first and only

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,340
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,020
power of esther's when we first

00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,250
discussed our expectations for building

00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,140
a family of phones for use with

00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,359
asterisks our requirements were pretty

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,710
simple we asked the team to build the

00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,020
phones such that they were easy to

00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:16,210
install integrate provision and use I

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,280
think you'll soon agree our engineers

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,080
have delivered on that goal user

00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,700
feedback is validating that when it

00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,130
comes to operation with astro space

00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,080
systems including our own Switchvox

00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,750
based product these are the easiest to

00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,090
use best integrated most interoperable

00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,770
products on the market today the Digium

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,200
family of phones will initially include

00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:37,420
three IP desk phones uniquely designed

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,280
to complement any asterisk or Switchvox

00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,380
based solution these phones are

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,570
different for a number of reasons first

00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,850
there is clue sively designed for use

00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,470
with asterisks secondly we've made it

00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,869
really easy to autodiscover and

00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,040
provision the phones next we've made it

00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:53,560
easy for the phones to access

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,309
information inside of asterisks allowing

00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,309
tight coupling

00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:58,299
between an application and the phone

00:45:56,309 --> 00:46:00,459
additionally we've created an

00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:02,559
applications engineer that allows users

00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:05,799
and developers to create and run their

00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,569
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:09,519
done all of this at a very compelling

00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:11,199
price point at Digium we're always

00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,299
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,880
the best value in business phone systems

00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:17,439
and also give them the power to create

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,569
their own solutions or any

00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:21,309
communications challenge well continue

00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,719
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:24,789
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,410
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:28,869
asterisk and what communications even

00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:32,039
easier and together we'll change the way

00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,039
the world communication again

00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:10,109
