this is my email address if you would

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,759
like to harass me now or later you can

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,739
find me on Twitter or praise me that is

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,930
also recommended I like that stuff so

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,470
today I hope that you actually learned

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,520
something

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,500
while you're here number one is how the

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,330
heck do I get my community on the road

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,830
to somewhere so we're going to look at

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,010
this and they sort of admittedly

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,710
incredibly simplified fashion it's the

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,080
version of my three steps to progress

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,330
the second thing I hope you learn is

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,070
basically what free and open source

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,740
software tools are there that will help

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:44,330
me to do these types of things I

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:50,190
encourage you all to use the Foss Luke

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:54,300
so about me I am the well I of that so I

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,970
have a long and varied background when I

00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,240
was 19 I ditched out of school because

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,580
it was 1998 hey you could make a lot of

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,440
money on that internet thing and so uh I

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,110
became a system administrator at

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,570
Motorola I admin AIX machines like 80 of

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,170
them in a production environment where

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,810
we made computers ironically enough so

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,120
most of my job was really coming to work

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,940
it two in the morning on saturday nights

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,720
during bachelorette parties because i

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,610
had a pager and helping people print

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,430
labels and stuff like that so i'm still

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,459
recovering from that whole thing and to

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:40,560
all of you who are sis admins you guys

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:45,080
do great work and good job so yeah that

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,690
was paid your days oh I'm skipping ahead

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,340
yeah so those are my pager days after

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,820
that I went and became a industry

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,040
analyst I wrote lots of reports about

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,390
how great the Internet age was and how

00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,519
much money everyone was going to make I

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,900
was one of those people that didn't pan

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,870
out so well as some of you may remember

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,019
from the year 2000 2001 after that I

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:13,709
went to a big chip manufacturer called

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:16,019
intel i did for casting on processors so

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,560
now i am the fedora project leader at

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,260
Red Hat who here uses fedora

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,370
well that's a I like seeing those hands

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,960
that's good so my job is to bleed work

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,350
with the community in sort of a open and

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,419
transparent fashion I'm responsible for

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,880
maintaining a good line of communication

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,530
between red hat and Fedora of course

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,490
everyone in the community is responsible

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,000
for maintaining good lines of

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,700
communication with each other anyway but

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,740
part of what I do is working with people

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,540
internally who may not be part of the

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,270
community at fedora reassuring them that

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,910
we are not going crazy and that if they

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,100
paid attention to us as they normally do

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,970
that that we're doing awesome so that's

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,740
a lot of a lot of my job um I'm not mel

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,660
gibson in braveheart i do not have do

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,310
face paint I don't walk around the

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:11,540
swords I like building consensus swords

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,639
are bad they're sharp so the M in this

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,330
equation is mom so that's the other

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,700
thing I do in my my spare time I have

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,360
two kids they're lovely their names are

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,310
Lauren and Warren motherhood is

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,770
interesting that was what happened when

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,350
i left Intel you can read into that

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,570
however you'd like I was able to spend

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,640
eight years at home with my kids which

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,570
is you know privilege and you know I'm

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,880
very happy that I did that so during

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:45,979
those eight years I became very good at

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,919
dealing with children so yeah I'm good

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,940
at breaking up fights I'm good at

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,620
teaching people how to act like

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,139
civilized human beings cleaning up

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,440
disasters I'm good at that making

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,820
executive decisions all these things I

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,200
learned by having children but the

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,000
number one thing I learned that is

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:07,130
applicable to my job right now comes

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,780
from Dora who has kids all right who

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:14,990
here is seen Dora all right okay so for

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,550
those of you who live a better life than

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,550
the rest of us Dora

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,660
Dora Dora is a kids show on nickelodeon

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,540
dora lift somewhere Central America

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,980
South America they don't really ever say

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,250
but she basically teaches kids a couple

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,870
Spanish words in every episode like hola

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,760
or you know whatever it is that they're

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,280
talking about that day but most of the

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:43,580
focus of the show is on friendship and

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:46,020
caring perseverance and getting places

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,930
so the standard or plot line looks like

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,520
this Dora is some place it's usually at

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,530
her home or maybe she's at school and

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,780
then something absolutely terrible

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,960
happens to her I was really bad stuff so

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:02,370
she consults her animated map what a

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,820
singing map he dances around and he says

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,950
Dora you need to get to the blank to do

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,530
blanking blank right and then she does

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,380
it she's from friends you know Benny the

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,360
bull and ISA the Iguana a couple other

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,230
people you'll notice none of them ever

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,660
wear pants very strange usually Swiper

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,720
the Fox sneaky Fox Swiper comes along

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:30,750
and he totally screws up her day not

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:34,770
cool right so when we applying a couple

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:39,270
lessons from Dora to getting your

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:41,160
project places so um number one is as

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,750
community people we sort of have the

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,660
tendency to ignore the rest of the

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,460
universe and meander along on our merry

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,770
way to nowhere until something horrible

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,500
happens like Swiper the Fox or you know

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,470
whatever don't wait for sneaky Fox wiper

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,000
to come along and make you have to make

00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,220
decisions you know it's good to always

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,260
know what your path is and not have to

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,170
wait for Swiper to be the impetus for

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,800
you to make decisions don't get off your

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,560
path if you have distractions um the

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,570
other thing is being transparent about

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,370
your game plan he else is easy for Dora

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,730
she's got a map she opens it up she

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,200
tells her little buddies without pants

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,760
that's good you know in community land

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,220
we need to write these things down so

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,560
that everybody understands it other

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,790
thing to remember animated talking maps

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,370
do not actually

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:33,120
for you in real life unless you're in a

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:37,140
car you have google but sometimes you

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,720
have to forge your own life so the first

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,370
thing you want to think about so you're

00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,470
getting from point A to point wherever

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:48,960
down the road is where are we now okay

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,820
so in saying this I'm going to assume

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,650
that we're all starting from blank

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,180
slates you have no game plans or maybe

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,580
Swiper the Fox has come and screwed up

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,880
your day but this is the the first step

00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,730
in what we're looking at here why is

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,710
this important right like doesn't

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,630
everyone in my community know like what

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,240
we're doing and where we're at now and

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,970
you know what's going on okay so who

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,620
here has ever tried to take a large

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:19,260
group of people to dinner right so first

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,080
you're like okay who's allergic to fish

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,840
and oh right you're a vegan and you only

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,290
eat bacon and you know you've got all

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,510
these things right and someone else is

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,700
like oh I ate there last night I really

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,320
don't want to eat there again oh it's

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,380
also four hundred dollars a plate so you

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,420
know maybe we shouldn't do that right we

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,670
also don't want to drive like 40 miles

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:47,340
away to italy to go to eat that would be

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:48,780
you know silly so knowing where you're

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,420
at helps you to make reasonable

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,250
decisions about where you're going in

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,650
the future so if we hearken back to the

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,180
the dinner example right tonight we are

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,340
not going to be going to dinner in paris

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,410
right because we are on the other side

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,620
of the ocean you know we only have our

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:07,740
legs so having dinner in Paris tonight

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,230
as a goal sort of a bad idea not very

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,370
realistic so why some well some of this

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,260
may seem pretty obvious it's not

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,720
surprising when you think about it in

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,190
terms of a community people want to get

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,400
somewhere that is a billion miles away

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,960
six months do you know it's nice to have

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,750
goals sometimes you need to be realistic

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,750
so I like to encourage that

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:38,820
so tools for figuring out where you are

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,680
so the number one thing I like to point

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,000
out to people is you know finding data

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,390
points and also making sure that they

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,870
can be reusable over time right so if

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:52,020
your goal is let's say we want to get

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,340
more people to to use stuff right you

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,680
know if you decide on a goal at some

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,990
point down the road you want to know

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,370
like things like oh are we tracking

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,690
downloads you know do we have these

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,860
kinds of numbers available because that

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,320
would probably be helpful to tell if

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,240
we're you know making progress as we get

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,890
down the road or if our goal eventually

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,620
becomes we want to have more features

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,970
than our competitors software right know

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,290
what the heck you have right now because

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,280
otherwise you're not going to be able to

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,050
count surveys is the other really

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,470
interesting thing that you can use to

00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,880
get sort of a feel about where you are

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,110
right now just from from general

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,570
community members what you don't want

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,740
well I guess you could do is go out and

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,360
ask other people what they think about

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,000
your community but you may not want to

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,920
mix those two particular surveys up so

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,610
if you go and ask people what it is that

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,110
you're doing how do you feel about the

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,310
project today you know what what do we

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,750
think our goals are right now those

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,900
types of things really help you to get a

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,150
good feel for where we are on the map

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,320
you know right now point a what is it

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,390
because if you don't know where you're

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,730
at really hard to tell you where you're

00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:03,690
going also dora dora has a paper matte

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,570
her cousin Diego he's a GPS and it's

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,480
part of his super computer and it's just

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:17,160
very cruel it turns into airplanes not

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:18,750
fair so let's assume I know I'm skipping

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,310
the part where this is all going to be

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,140
very sort of dramatic and people are

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,330
going to you know there might be

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,360
grumbling or anger but we're going to

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:31,020
assume that this went along swimmingly

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,970
once you have this where are we now that

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,740
is a good starting point right because

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,290
when you were there you now can start

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,760
thinking about where do we want to go

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,410
where can we actually go what's a

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,570
reasonable destination how long is it

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,070
going to take us to get there where do

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,609
we want to stop along the way so things

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,829
like my

00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:52,379
etc I think the most important thing

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:57,249
about this is really being realistic not

00:12:52,379 --> 00:13:01,659
bursting people's hearts so to that end

00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:05,349
I think knowing that you have reasonable

00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:07,449
chances of success is good demoralizing

00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:08,739
people you know saying we're all going

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,879
to do this and then six months later

00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:14,559
they feel like they don't have any

00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:16,499
progress you know not very awesome this

00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,959
is probably the most difficult part of

00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:22,479
what you do because no one is ever going

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,459
to agree on you know what is this thing

00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:27,459
that we want to be you know a year or

00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,869
two years from now so you know

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,819
communities have lots of types of

00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:33,339
personalities and people contribute for

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:34,779
different reasons so while we all want

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,839
to say that we you know we don't want to

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:39,909
leave different types of people behind

00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,339
it's at some point you need to accept

00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:43,839
that you can't please everybody some

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,159
people you know sometimes it means that

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,619
some people just aren't going to be

00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:51,669
along for the ride and you know that

00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:53,470
sucks but you can't always you know

00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,589
please everyone and please everybody's

00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,249
needs and you know not be a jack of all

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:02,709
trades speaking of jack of all trades I

00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:06,279
have a personal anecdote that I would

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:08,319
like to share with everyone for this as

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:11,799
an example of how that type of thing

00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:13,269
could go wrong so I worked at the large

00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,099
processor manufacturer which I mentioned

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,709
previously which I will not now name my

00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:20,470
name and I worked in the embedded group

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,789
where we basically repurposed processors

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,569
that were really cool like four or five

00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:27,609
years ago into new little embedded

00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:29,649
devices right because whenever a big

00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:32,139
manufacturer would come out with a new

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,249
processor it wasn't just like a software

00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,479
company where ever you know you'd set up

00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,499
a couple more people at a desk they have

00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:37,179
to think about it three years in advance

00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:39,159
cuz they gotta build a giant building

00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,099
which is only made for that specific

00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,419
type of manufacturing so they want to

00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:45,309
get as much mileage out of that as they

00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,799
could so we're encouraged to figure out

00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:51,519
all sorts of crazy markets for these

00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,929
little processors right so when I was

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,889
there my job was figuring out stuff like

00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:56,149
hey ATM machines hmm

00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,309
I wonder what kind of processors are in

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,259
those hey can we get Intel for big

00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:02,689
manufacturer processors and those yeah

00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:06,109
we could probably do that you know that

00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,939
kind of stuff so the unfun part about

00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:09,769
this was that we never really got to

00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,239
invent anything and this this sort of

00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,660
bummed people out right all we were

00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:16,850
doing was basically marketing and not

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:20,029
engineering so hey wouldn't it be cool

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,350
if we had our own ship for other

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:25,179
applications that we think are big

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,179
markets but you know we're not yet there

00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:31,519
so basically marketing comes up with a

00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,739
bunch of money making solutions right oh

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,389
if we had something chick that could fit

00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:37,819
in this like telecommunications board

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,799
dude we be rockin we can make like 100

00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:41,660
million dollars a year and then the

00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,339
people who work on MRI machines like

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,040
dude if we had a puss or for this MRI

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,499
machine I could totally do something

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,850
with that I can make us a bunch of money

00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:51,919
and then everybody gathers all this

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,480
stuff together right and puts it all

00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,790
together like look we've got this chip

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,679
and it's totally amazing and it doesn't

00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,329
actually work for any of the solutions

00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,509
at all because it does too much and it's

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,309
it's too expensive and it's too hot and

00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:06,739
you know all sorts of other problems

00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:08,119
because we tried to jam too much crap

00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:10,549
into it because we wanted to please

00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:11,720
everybody instead of picking and

00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:14,660
choosing which fights were the most

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:19,189
important we wound up with something

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:22,369
that sort of lost money so that that is

00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:25,399
a my personal lesson to you all live

00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:27,489
vicariously me so figuring out where

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,339
you're going is really about consensus

00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:32,629
if you if people aren't on board you

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,889
know the ship ain't leaving unless they

00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,360
are telling you that you know I'm

00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,129
definitely not getting on the ship and

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm just going to get on a different

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,980
boat you can't really decide that you're

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,689
going to do something completely

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,899
unrelated to what you want to do now

00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:51,949
like so for example I am you know in

00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:53,929
fedora as I am a poor decision for us to

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:56,839
make would be to say that we're going to

00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,269
start opening record stores you know you

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:03,470
need to stay late into what it is that

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:06,019
you're doing so back to tools tools for

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,689
determining where are we going surveys

00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:09,159
again

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,350
the tricky part about surveys is that

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:14,049
you can lead people on with your words

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:17,139
like impress upon them like I really

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:20,669
want you to choose a and you want to be

00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:24,159
unbiased and not cause a bunch of drama

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:25,509
be careful with your wording there's

00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,220
lots of discussion tools you guys have

00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,549
probably seen most of these wikis and

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:33,549
IRC and mailing lists documentation

00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:36,340
again number one thing to remember write

00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:38,379
down what you're doing where you started

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,659
we're going so that everybody

00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:43,929
understands what the heck it is that

00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:45,519
you're doing and that it's open people

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,139
aren't surprised like how my god i

00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,230
didn't know this how come nobody ever

00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:52,330
told me tell them remind people say it

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,360
multiple times don't forget folks we're

00:17:52,330 --> 00:18:00,279
on the boat to wherever that's how you

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,379
keep people on board so the fun part is

00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:06,820
where you figure out how to get from

00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:09,639
point A to point B over here which is

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,009
things like defining milestones length

00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,450
of time and the really cool part of

00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:19,990
letting people take ownership sand their

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:22,690
task so why do we need milestones all

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:27,639
right does anyone ever gone out on a hot

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:31,509
date with a supermodel spot oh I'm so

00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:33,549
sorry ok so like going on a hot date

00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:37,480
with a supermodel right I have to stop

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,610
at the Ferrari rental place before i get

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,649
to supermodel because I will not have

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,950
successful supermodel if I do not have

00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:47,409
my faux fur re right if you don't get

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,850
the Ferrari your plan is doomed you

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,250
probably won't even want to proceed any

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,830
further right so having milestones and

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,870
sort of schedule to go along with it

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,340
helps people to see progress and what

00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,350
you're doing it's good for existing

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,639
contributors as well as potential

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,490
contributors and users because they get

00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,600
an understanding you know how long it's

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,830
going to be until something happens

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,379
right if I come to your project and I

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,539
say hey where's your what's your feature

00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:13,029
plan for the next you know six months

00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:16,340
ago alright well are you going to be

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:19,070
doing this you know fixing this bug

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,250
I don't know maybe well yeah we're going

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:25,580
to fix it we're gonna do that I don't

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,620
know maybe next you know people see

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,150
these things being published they get

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,679
the sense that it's sort of an alive

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,409
project it's something that they want to

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,400
use maybe they will actually be able to

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:36,470
see that something they can participate

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,090
in maybe that's something that doesn't

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,610
have an owner and that's something where

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,220
they can jump it so here's a good

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:48,830
example of showing a plan with

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:51,799
milestones so this is the map this is

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,840
actually him down here hundreds the logo

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,730
from the page that I borrowed this

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,450
picture friend I'm going to give it back

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,130
right afterwards so he sings a song that

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,580
goes and I'm not going to sing because

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,440
you guys like your eardrums he says if

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,659
there's someplace you want to go on the

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,860
one you need to know I'm the map then he

00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:14,539
has some other stuff like that right so

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,510
usually Dora's kind of going from point

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:20,450
A to point B so this is the sort of a

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:23,419
good example from Dora on Twitter first

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,880
we go through the rainforest next we

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:30,200
have to cross crocodile Lake and that's

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:33,080
how I get to school every morning so for

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,130
Dora it's very clear like where she

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,450
starts right she's over here actually

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,520
they all show her in this picture but

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,419
you know she's over here it like Boots's

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:48,080
treehouse and she's gotta get over here

00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:50,210
too on starbucks halt starbucks so you

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,450
know in this case it's through a forest

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:57,020
and then through probably crocodile Lake

00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:01,700
and passed a random Mayan pyramid of

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:05,899
some sort and then starbucks in in the

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,279
southern part of this hemisphere so the

00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,049
other interesting thing you'll notice

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,760
about a a show with door is that they're

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,059
they're obvious time definitions right

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,970
so she has to get from here the

00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:19,549
treehouse to starbucks between you know

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,289
the start of 30 minutes and the end of

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,200
30 minutes and she knows that she has to

00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:27,350
get to you know the Mayan pyramid thing

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,539
ah like right around the second or third

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,700
commercial break you know and the entire

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,730
way she keeps the rhythm going of where

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,679
are we going to starbucks right and they

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,450
sing this song every time they hit a

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,330
milestone they all cheer and then they

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,320
say yes now we're going to the next day

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,519
and that's something that you should

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,309
always remember to do to in your

00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,870
community right if you never call out

00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:49,250
that we actually achieve something or

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,950
that we got somewhere and did something

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,970
and you know we're proud of ourselves

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,380
people are going to forget that that was

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,789
even a milestone they're going to forget

00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,850
where we're going and it's going to kind

00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:04,700
of get back into the boring wall of

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:09,590
meandering along but you know not really

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:12,039
getting anywhere so schedules who here

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:15,830
reads the Fedora project schedule oh

00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,960
please don't do that to me so in my

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:21,200
former life I was the a fedora program

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,100
manager where I maintain these schedules

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,620
and in fact it's still my other job so I

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,370
am very much familiar with scheduling

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,559
stuff so when you start thinking about

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:37,010
building your map and your milestones

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,840
after you determined point a and point B

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,970
you want to think about whether or not

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,429
you're going to use a feature-based

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,500
schedule or a time-based schedule now I

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,600
am assuming that based on previous

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,549
slides that you've actually thought

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,110
about having a schedule like that that

00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:52,730
might be a good thing to publish and so

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,000
if that was what was going through your

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:58,100
head thumbs up to you feature-based

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,789
basically means that in order for

00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:04,100
version X to come out this following

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:05,990
list of things has to be done right no

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,210
matter how long it takes we're not

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,549
releasing until we get to hear right

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,200
until all these things are done time

00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:14,779
based scheduling means that you know

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,840
come hell or high water we're going to

00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:20,539
get this puppy out the door by you know

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,960
this date that we have determined far in

00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:28,639
advance so feature-based schedules as I

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,380
said before it's about having these

00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:32,179
these key features for release actually

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,649
be done so when you're building this

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:35,750
type of schedule you want to think about

00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,049
things like how long are these

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,019
milestones actually going to

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,820
you know to get there do we have serious

00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,649
commitment from people to actually do

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,379
the work because if one of them decides

00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:47,669
that you know he no longer wants to do

00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:50,879
this and he's going to start painting

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:54,659
for a living we could be very screwed

00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:56,730
right so you need to have pretty good

00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,340
commitment and people who are very

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:01,200
willing to to own up stuff so this is

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,029
something that you see more I think in

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,139
proprietary software and you know maybe

00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:08,610
manufacturing you know because if they

00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:11,179
don't get somewhere you know they're not

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:14,129
going to have a physical thing to sell

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:18,269
for you know us and software you know

00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:19,830
there's less of a impetus to have a you

00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,090
know go from nothing to having a shiny

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,739
ball because we have this piece of

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,960
software that sort of slowly evolves

00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:27,239
over time but you can't really play with

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,940
a half blown up piece of plastic that

00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:35,580
isn't quite a ball yet right time-based

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,129
schedules so lots of projects uses

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,279
methodology fedoras one of them actually

00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:45,090
I think most distros are along the same

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:48,359
line other projects who here is used

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:52,470
OpenStack or heard of OpenStack they do

00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:54,600
the same thing every six months so this

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,299
type of methodology involves a lot of

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,889
working backwards from that that six

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,679
month or nine month or you know whatever

00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:04,859
their their cadence is to figure out

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,779
what they can do between the end and you

00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,700
know how much how much time they can

00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:13,049
squeeze in between the end and the

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:15,419
beginning basically the other point from

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:18,809
this to remember is that there are

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,769
dependencies and you really need to

00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,019
understand what all of those

00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:25,409
dependencies are to actually make an

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:28,019
effective schedule that's really one of

00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:29,940
the the big pitfalls which I will talk

00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,679
about the second so who here is an

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,710
experienced feature creep or scope creep

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,379
or know what those things are nice well

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,609
I'm I'm glad that you've heard of them

00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:40,320
I'm going to assume you haven't actually

00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:44,970
experienced them you've just heard about

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:48,539
those things that avoided them so scope

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,130
creep is we're at the project level the

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,480
goals that you set

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:57,570
out to accomplish start to just

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,460
magically become like a longer longer

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,050
list right like people start slipping

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,720
things and feature creep is pretty

00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:06,000
similar it's when your set of required

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,410
features just starts growing long so

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,620
this could be problematic right if you

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,150
have a feature-based schedule yeah we'll

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,070
just stick one more in it'll only be

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,020
another week or only be another two

00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,700
weeks and next thing you know you've got

00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,810
a product that can't come out for seven

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,570
years because a bunch of people have

00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:25,050
actually snuck stuff in there which is

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,850
not cool also you know with scope you'll

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,190
see things that are like oh we're going

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,770
to do this and it's easy and then they

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,180
magically make it more complicated

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,560
underneath right Oh instead of having it

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,450
connect to like one thing we're going to

00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,650
have it connect to 45 things but no one

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:42,900
will ever know right scary stuff so

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:45,330
having what your actual plan is and what

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,300
what your features or you know whatever

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,920
you want to call them are having those

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,500
things written down and making sure that

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,110
everyone is in agreement about what that

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,650
thing actually is nothing more nothing

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,770
less but exactly what it is is a good

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,570
because you can really wind up in the

00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,050
situation where it's just never going to

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:10,190
ship ever ever ever so I recommend

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,190
avoiding that yes

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:23,990
how do we are you talking about specific

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,419
to fedora so in fedora we actually have

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,740
a feature submission process where

00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:30,230
people make a wiki page of their

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,539
proposed feature you can come from

00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,460
anybody but it's basically you know what

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:38,900
what is it what does it do why is this

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,940
useful what are some of the implications

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,799
that may have with with other pieces of

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,840
software what sort of dependencies does

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,270
it have you know who could this possibly

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,860
screw up you know if I do this is it

00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,860
going to screw up anyone's life right so

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,600
if I'm doing a new version of a language

00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,100
right and we're going to recompile

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,380
everything with that you know it's nice

00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,730
for those people whose stuff is being

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,770
recompiled to know that that is

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,590
happening so they can keep their eyes

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,960
out for that and not be stuck the night

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,429
before you know something's saying you

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,870
didn't get your stuff done right this is

00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,210
sort of what what this kind of thing

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,610
tries to avoid but after people have

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:17,480
made those feature pages fesco takes

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,280
them they review them they vote yes or

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,039
no we post them to the feature list

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,150
people have to report in at least once a

00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,770
month on the progress that they're

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,270
making and they have to be done with

00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,730
their features to a certain degree by a

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:32,450
certain date so feature fries they have

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,700
to be at least runnable moderately

00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,679
testable and then there's a feature

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,740
completion date later on where they have

00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,200
to be a hundred percent done but there's

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,429
not really pressure from it's mostly

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,679
just pressure from people within the

00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,880
community you know we all like to see

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,860
that the things that you're planning on

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,240
doing it done and you know there's

00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,250
pressure to get it done and you know

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,350
also certainly people are saying you

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,030
know oh you're not getting it done how

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,500
can I help you get it done you know are

00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:01,030
you being blocked by something how can

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,950
we you know get this done better for you

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,770
does that answer your question I failed

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:10,340
to say what was your question your

00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:14,179
question was does your your features

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:16,470
come from do the features come from the

00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,720
user community or from rel or where they

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:22,409
and I would say they come largely from

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,030
the the Fedora community so there's not

00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:27,510
a lot of features that come along from

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:30,169
end users you know people who can't do

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,340
the work features are generally proposed

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,659
99.999% of time by the person who's

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,240
actually going to be doing the work

00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:38,159
because you know I can propose all that

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,100
I want but you wouldn't want to ever see

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,659
any code that I ever wrote because it

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,590
would be like a shell script saying

00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:53,880
hello world so or maybe a wiki page but

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:57,659
that's not really even code so did I

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,669
cutter this ah I covered a bit of this

00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,940
just now so when you're making a

00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,929
schedule number one and even when you're

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,210
talking about features and I just

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:09,000
mentioned this let the people who are

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,500
doing the work figure out what the heck

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the features are they're committing to

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,260
and how long it's going to take them to

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,960
do it because you know while it's very

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,120
easy for me to say oh I bet you can

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,630
rewrite all of network manager in like

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,370
two weeks right he's going to kill me if

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,780
I actually do that because you know

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,159
that's not awesome he didn't commit to

00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,169
do it he didn't want to do it that's

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,650
nothing he was planning so having that

00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:33,179
guy say what he's going to do or isn't

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,330
as we do in fedora have him make the

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,220
feature page is really the way to go

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,659
make sure that planning features and

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,760
advertising them all those features

00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,799
happens like in the schedule like that

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,070
is part of your development process so

00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,260
people understand as I was saying I have

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,230
to propose my features by this date I

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:56,520
have to maybe have my documentation done

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:57,659
by this date if I am somebody else you

00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,400
know working in other parts of the

00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,580
distribution or in the other parts of

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,929
the pieces of software I want to be able

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,490
to look at everything you know that

00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,409
they're all the stuff that his plan is

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,150
here on it by a certain date right so

00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:11,070
I'm not like having to check every day

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,570
like I don't know did something get at

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,280
it or did something get dropped you know

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,780
I don't know but you know if you know

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,400
when that date is by which everything

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,659
has to be there you don't have to worry

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,690
about it you can go look at it on that

00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:23,940
day and say ah now I know what's going

00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,649
to be affecting me in the future so i

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,780
recommend having your schedule start at

00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:29,049
the beginning and beginning I mean not

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,779
when development begins

00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:40,389
but when you're planning begins oh yes

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:42,309
understanding your dependencies knowing

00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:45,789
your dependencies can make or break your

00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:51,489
schedule right so if I am developing a

00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:53,320
piece of let's say software there's some

00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:56,350
other people over here writing

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,970
documentation if I decide at some point

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:02,320
that oh my software is not actually

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:05,529
going to be ready by a certain point and

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,529
I don't tell them by a certain point

00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:10,119
they're going to assume that everything

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:13,179
that was done and said that was going to

00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:15,730
be done by this specific date actually

00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:19,119
happened right they may not always here

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,559
over here that oh gosh that dude who

00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,269
didn't finish this thing didn't tell

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,159
anybody and I still wrote all of this

00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:28,659
documentation Wow doesn't that feel like

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,609
a waste of my time it's not cool there's

00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:33,730
all sorts of dependencies that that

00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:36,850
happened right you don't want to put in

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:41,649
a piece of software after you know

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:43,509
testing is started you don't want to do

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:46,179
things before you know there's all sorts

00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:50,769
of stuff that you just don't want to

00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:52,299
forget about partially because you know

00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,679
you can really screw things up the other

00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:56,289
thing is is sometimes you can just leave

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,239
people kind of hanging out with you know

00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:00,369
feeling like they don't have anything to

00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:02,980
do because they're just waiting for you

00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:04,690
know something to happen but they don't

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,179
know when it's going to be or if it's

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,889
going to be maybe they can be working on

00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:11,139
something else they're not really sure

00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:13,359
so being able to look at all the

00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:17,049
dependencies in a chain of what needs to

00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,700
get done and what all those things

00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:27,340
relationship to the overall schedule is

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:30,879
is is really helpful also if you are

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,429
doing stuff like well basically anything

00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:38,139
in software land testing planning

00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:38,890
whatever make sure that people are kind

00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:41,860
in that they

00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,240
you don't say oh yeah you know somewhere

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,980
in here all software needs to be done

00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,170
and then we'll do the testing right make

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,410
sure you pick a date make sure that that

00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,850
date isn't like one day for everything

00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,830
else to magically happen right you're

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:57,250
not going to document and test and do

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,920
everything in in one day and don't do it

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,800
like oh whoops we didn't realize it was

00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,810
Christmas Eve oh sorry about that I you

00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,310
know there are other outside factors

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,710
that you probably want to consider like

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,630
if you were doing a big project at a

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,460
university you know don't make the

00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,440
release date the day before graduation

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,899
or the day after graduation that's just

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,340
you know bad so think about you know

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:24,130
some of the little outside things in the

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:27,240
world that happen as well publishing

00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:29,080
schedules so this goes back to the

00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,140
transparency stuff that I talked about

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,649
earlier putting it out there you know

00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:37,390
detail but not overwhelming scary non

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,820
understandable detail you know you need

00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:42,580
it to be pretty understandable that's

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,020
helpful ownership which is a great thing

00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,610
you know you like to see people having

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,919
pride in what they do taking ownership

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,500
for what they do make sure that those

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,940
owners are out there documented so

00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,440
there's no question about who the heck

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,120
was supposed to do that how you know I

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,100
said I said I wasn't be able to do that

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,230
you know you just assumed I was going to

00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,000
know just put it over there make sure

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,820
somebody feels empowered to take it and

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,280
then write it down know what making sure

00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,110
people know deadlines making sure they

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,580
know what the major milestones are like

00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,350
here is when we're starting development

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,400
this is where development ends you know

00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,070
you don't need to get into the

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,410
nitty-gritty stuff but you know basic

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:19,450
stuff like this testing you know the big

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,650
things having that stuff out there you

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:25,300
know things like betas alphas etc helps

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,130
everybody to be more or less on the same

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,630
page you know maybe specific teams have

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:32,110
more detailed schedules we do that

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,940
fedora but not everybody in you know

00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,580
stay release engineering those was going

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,440
on at marketing but we know that we do

00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,320
have some synchronization points like

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,810
when the Alpha happens after he's made

00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,840
the the image that we upload somewhere

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:49,060
then marketing says yay it's out there

00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,040
right you know if he doesn't

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,180
know that he's doing that then we might

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:58,090
do something ridiculously stupid making

00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:01,540
it public again make sure everybody

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:05,410
knows where it is how to find it they

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:08,670
note that a schedule is this etc so

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:10,900
enforcing schedule I used to have a whip

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:14,080
who's really enjoyable I don't have it

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,670
anymore it makes me sad it's okay so I

00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,020
hear this question all the time how

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,290
would the hell need it people to do

00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,700
things on time when they're volunteering

00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,260
well that's an excellent question right

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,780
because you know this is an open source

00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,480
project and you don't really you know

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,100
it's not like I'm the boss and I tell

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,330
them and they say oh god if I don't do

00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,940
what she says I'm not going to be eating

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,460
because it's not true at all right so i

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,260
think the number one thing is to ensure

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,940
that people always have sort of a sense

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,460
of ownership and pride and what they're

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,000
doing and definitely leadership you know

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,980
not that they're just doing something

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,420
and no one cares but that you know

00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:53,890
that's something that they're they're

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:57,070
really owning up for their leading you

00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,810
know there's a champion of making sure

00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,580
that people how understand like how

00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,520
their pieces affect other people's

00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,620
pieces things like checking in like hey

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,630
i noticed that you haven't updated your

00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,070
feature page in like six months despite

00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,590
my constant harassment so i'm going to

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,050
pick up full volume becoming an

00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,460
announcement guru you know I'm queen of

00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:18,610
announcements I have literally have a

00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,720
folder of like copy paste you know

00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,310
things that I do and sometimes that

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,510
backfires because I'll forget to change

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,980
the year or something but I do my best

00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:30,330
public discussions of progress like

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,740
mustard you know are we getting places

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,970
even in meetings you know when you ask

00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:38,380
people like hey how's this thing coming

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:41,260
you know people don't always like to

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,580
admit that they're falling behind and I

00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,500
think it's good to remind people that

00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:47,620
that it's okay like we would rather know

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,470
now rather than eight months from now

00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,930
that that you're behind right because

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,820
that's how you can get help that's how

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,140
we can put you know a second plan in

00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,120
place like you know what's the back-up

00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,200
plan what's a contingent contingency

00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:04,210
plan if

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,190
this doesn't happen peer pressure fits

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,290
in a little bit here but you know you

00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,880
don't want to paint someone to be like

00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,339
the ruiner of all good things in the

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,349
universe right like oh well if you don't

00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:15,700
do this then the universe is going to

00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:18,400
crumple that's not really you know go

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:22,180
and give anyone a warm fuzzy by any

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,859
means but you know offer people help

00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,720
like even if you can't give the help

00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:27,130
like how can I help you find help you

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,089
know could you give me a shortened

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,180
version of what it is that you're

00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:32,530
looking for those types of things go a

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,660
long way and just making sure that

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,940
people feel good about the pieces that

00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,859
they own and I think encourages them

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,220
more to actually stick with what they

00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:43,690
promise to in schedule so at some point

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:48,280
in here I told you that there were

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:52,119
promises of tools right so not all

00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,589
schedules are complicated sometimes it's

00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,589
like a three-person project right you're

00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:58,390
not building an operating system so

00:38:55,589 --> 00:39:00,460
having something incredibly scary or

00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,490
large or detailed isn't really necessary

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,160
right so wiki page web page that kind of

00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,869
stuff maybe all you need just with basic

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,460
stuff you know milestones release dates

00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:11,470
what are we planning for the future

00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,849
here's what it's going to be done by our

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,819
here's when you know we're hoping it's

00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:17,770
going to be done by etc even if your

00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:19,420
schedule is complicated you still want

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,210
to make those things public so that

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,740
everybody understands I keep repeating

00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,510
this stuff about transparency and

00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,480
openness but it's not a crock it's

00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,790
really true for more complicated things

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,500
where you want to understand

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,900
dependencies where there's lots of

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:39,390
people involved I recommend using is

00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,470
some sort of a scheduling tool right so

00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,319
the answer to all your problems is not

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,940
Microsoft Project I know that that is

00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,490
probably what most people learned about

00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:50,560
at some point like in college you know

00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,780
they took some sort of course they

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,670
learned about project or at some point

00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,260
they're busted you know I need you to

00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:00,130
get the project and estimate your number

00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,390
of hours on all these things in there so

00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,099
we're not when you're talking on

00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,000
microsoft project today right we were

00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,220
going to talk about something called

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,290
task juggler which is what i use and is

00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,810
a open source scheduling tool very

00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:13,840
similar to

00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:15,670
evil vil up at the top there it manages

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,230
all sorts of stuff all the things you

00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,680
would really like to be able to

00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,970
manipulate right so tasks right you know

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,920
you want to know what all those things

00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,420
are what you know the lengths they can

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,800
be days they can be weeks they can be

00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,290
hours it can be minutes whatever

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,880
resources who are the people working on

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,520
this stuff or what is the team assigned

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,850
to this stuff dependencies and

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,430
relationships between certain tasks

00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:41,020
scenarios you know if we have a hundred

00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:44,140
people working on this and everything

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,760
goes hunky-dory or if the company goes

00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,320
under and we only have ten people

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,510
because we had to fire everybody else

00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,430
you know how's that going to affect the

00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,250
length of this you know in this case it

00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,830
would probably be a feature based

00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,540
product multiple time zones I know that

00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,670
you know lots of companies have people

00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,680
who are working all over the place and

00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,480
if you're doing stuff like we're all

00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,190
working for eight hours a day here there

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,470
and everywhere you can account for what

00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,660
those are in different places so that

00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,490
for people running very tight schedules

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,610
or they're doing testing and you know

00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,500
overnight work and that kind of stuff it

00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,210
can make better sense of that accounting

00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,340
if you actually keep track of how much

00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,140
stuff costs which you know doesn't

00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,270
always happen an open source land but

00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,060
you know sometimes people say oh these

00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,620
engineers cost whatever two hundred

00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,660
dollars an hour and you know by the end

00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:34,270
of the project will know how much this

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,740
bad boy took to put together in terms of

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,980
our money and how much we're going to

00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,170
have to pray that we make that back

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:44,740
dependencies yeah I shouldn't read my

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,480
slides more carefully finally for people

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,660
who like to see output in something

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,630
other than a giant tool you know it

00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,820
outputs in n HTML pages which is where

00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,230
the majority of people look at you know

00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,630
how things are done in fedora when they

00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:00,400
go to look at the schedule but you can

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,200
also do things like like pull pull the

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,660
schedule into your calendar so you know

00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,340
if you say oh I am an engineer I need to

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,230
pull the engineering calendar into my

00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,870
calendar and then it will pop up every

00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:17,430
day and remind you of all the work you

00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:20,680
have to do so hopefully

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,000
by this point you should have a

00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,380
reasonable understanding of how to

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,720
decide a couple things in the open

00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,579
source project and you should know about

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,010
some free and open source software tools

00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:31,900
that you can use to do all of these cool

00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,849
things and figure out where you want to

00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,290
go and know where you are you know once

00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:42,700
you've got all that sorted out how you

00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:44,530
can actually do this I also hope that

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:49,150
you have learned a couple things about

00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:53,290
Dora what she teaches small children how

00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:55,900
to actually apply that most of this was

00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:58,720
lessons from you know my life and door

00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,000
on my mommy hood in my past experiences

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,940
but I hope that some of this can help

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,849
you to do planning the open-source way

00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:15,130
for the future so does anyone have any

00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:19,569
questions you have to love him he's

00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:22,170
beautiful question I will repeat your

00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:22,170
question two

00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:37,890
not in fedora I've seen it happen in

00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:41,370
other projects with with varying degrees

00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:43,950
of success no one's really ever proposed

00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:49,050
it in fedora as you know how how we're

00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:50,880
actually going to do things I think it

00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:53,910
varies from project to project and how

00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:01,080
well people are tuned into those kinds

00:43:53,910 --> 00:44:03,900
of you know management techniques it you

00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,670
know it it varies you know I see some

00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,700
projects you know doing it reasonably

00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:12,150
well I see others doing it and you know

00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:15,000
that it they almost move so fast that no

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,230
one you know I always think that one of

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,100
the most important things that a project

00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,870
can do is get its software like into a

00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,030
distribution so that people can actually

00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,350
try not just like have their own repo or

00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,240
they hope that you know it's being kept

00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,680
up to date but literally put it in these

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,870
other pieces of you know these other

00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,180
distributions proper and I noticed that

00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:34,650
a lot of folks who use those kinds of

00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,930
methodologies they don't ever really

00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:40,260
think about doing that and they don't

00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,880
ever really have like a firm release

00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,920
right i mean there's like a release

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,860
every two weeks or every month but

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,330
knowing you know people who go to

00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,220
explore it don't always have a good

00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,900
sense of like oh this is definitely the

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,790
the big stable thing that we're doing

00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,180
right you know you put stuff in a

00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:59,250
distribution you want it to be you know

00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,930
working for the foreseeable future right

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,120
you know you want it you know for fedora

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,490
you probably want to be okay for the

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,230
next year so you know you're doing agile

00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,060
stuff you you know a lot of times people

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,130
just keep going and they don't think

00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,350
about this branch you know it wasn't

00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,060
even a branch that's just you know

00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,000
something that they left behind while

00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,650
they kept going so you know a lot of it

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,650
just depends on how thorough people are

00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,420
I see a lot of non thoroughness I've

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,220
seen lots of you know very thoroughness

00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,780
and lots of care for distributions you

00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,940
know from people who use those kinds of

00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,609
techniques so hmm

00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:36,030
you know I think a lot of scheduling

00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:37,890
stuff is not so much about you know the

00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,210
tool or the method you use but you know

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,130
whether or not the people who are doing

00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:44,220
the actual work pay attention to any of

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:45,810
it at all so do things and those in the

00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:57,440
spirit of you know what what it is that

00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:57,440
you're doing questions oh hi John

00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:23,090
i would say alcohol but that would be a

00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:27,470
terrible thing to say so not not

00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:28,640
entirely you know I think there are

00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:32,150
certain points in the cycle where

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,290
everybody is is burned out I don't

00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,119
really think that the key to solving

00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,530
that is you know maybe sometimes it is

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,270
that you know we're just trying to do

00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,970
too much and too short of a period of

00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:43,550
time and those are things that you would

00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,680
generally want to talk about like in a

00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,890
post-mortem like the cue a post-mortem

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,290
for example like guys you know we just

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:52,970
can't do this you know four days is not

00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:54,800
enough to get from from here to here

00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,810
without us you know not actually

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,910
sleeping and we're humans and we need to

00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,560
get you no more than three hours at

00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:04,430
night during this timeframe or two hours

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,630
a night or whatever but I know that

00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,540
there's also sort of a tendency for

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,820
people to just always give it their all

00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:13,190
I think in those cases sometimes it's

00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,850
it's on the project leader or the team

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:18,500
leader or whomever to say look you as a

00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,900
person are more important than getting

00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,850
this thing out the door I want you

00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,230
people to sleep because that's how we do

00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,430
things better you know we're not just

00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,720
trying to get something out the door

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,280
we're also community of people who

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,730
actually care about each other and so

00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,320
you know if it's a continual problem and

00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:35,030
it really does bring people out when

00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,590
they don't sleep you know and it's you

00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,690
know three times the cycle one it sucks

00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:41,690
you know someone eventually needs to say

00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,010
dude this sucks and figure out how you

00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,270
can actually go about changing it

00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,270
sometimes that's actually doing the

00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:50,570
scheduling stuff making it work better

00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:53,270
or sometimes it's simply you know

00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,650
telling people hey you know you need to

00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,090
sleep we're still going you know the

00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:01,220
world's not going to implode without you

00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:02,660
go to bed so that is my solution for

00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,190
that which isn't really much of a

00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,780
solution it's more of a a human

00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:08,530
touchy-feely solution but you know I

00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,530
think it's the truth

00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:26,840
no no no oh I do at some point but no I

00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:32,140
don't think any FPL's ever really had to

00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:34,580
be a tiebreaker is that true Paul I did

00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:37,280
consensus you know I think people do a

00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,740
good job of socializing and gathering

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,600
people around an idea before they you

00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,550
know just toss it up there for you know

00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,890
people to vote on you know I think if

00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,720
that was the case that more there would

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,400
probably be lots of tie breaking stuff

00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:52,190
but I think people you know want to make

00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,920
sure people are on board before they get

00:48:52,190 --> 00:49:05,510
totally flamed by you know flying

00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:09,920
tomatoes so desperately yes i have used

00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:12,350
a number of mine mappers before x mine

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,140
is the one that i have used and i really

00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:17,690
like i haven't done that with

00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:20,240
relationship to the schedule but you

00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,310
know with various like you know oh there

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,510
might be a problem in the schedule let's

00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,830
think about you know all these little

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,880
details that we might want to think

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,770
about while we're try to figure out how

00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,540
to solve this problem in the schedule

00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:32,030
like you know what what are all the

00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,830
things that occurred just so you can see

00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:36,530
them and see their relationships to each

00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:39,500
other i know some people forecast some

00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:42,950
people like no there's more more web

00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:45,830
based ones like remember the milk a

00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,540
couple other things like that I to be

00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,760
really bad and I know this is gonna

00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:53,420
sound terrible I'm i really like writing

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,920
things down sometimes so or I do it in

00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,320
notepad I haven't you know I have a

00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:00,080
diary file which is literally just you

00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,050
know my notes of this that and the other

00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,900
since like you know years and years and

00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:07,130
years ago just you know oh yeah I did

00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,250
that once here let me just search for

00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:14,270
this word and you know here's what it is

00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:18,280
but yeah I like my mapping stuff it's

00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,280
pretty cool a lot of people don't

00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:26,640
yeah keep it simple stupid I believe

00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:30,150
that's Lea of Polish realism that I

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:34,340
learned at one point he's rolling his

00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,340
eyes all right is that it

00:50:40,180 --> 00:51:01,099
keynote what are you guys giving away

00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:16,239
what are they giving away this year hot

00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:16,239
dogs oh yes all right let's oh okay

00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:23,180
the role of the Fedora project leader

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,800
yes I did talk about this at the

00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,410
beginning so the role of Fedora project

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,110
leader is too I like to think of it as

00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:33,140
leading by consensus perhaps you know

00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:35,620
gathering people around ideas to to move

00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:39,160
move things forward I'm also sort of the

00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:42,110
connection point between the project and

00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,930
the internal bowels of red hat if you

00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:46,670
will you know it's just sort of a a line

00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,530
of communication you know I'm basically

00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:51,260
responsible for telling them if things

00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,940
are going poorly but lately I mostly

00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,650
just tell them how awesome we are which

00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,410
has been really cool so it's been the

00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:01,640
bulk of my my job in the past couple of

00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:03,710
months since i started does that fully

00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,870
answer your question I don't think I've

00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:18,760
actually repeated the question once so

00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:18,760
sorry camera okay excellent I tried

00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:27,690
anyone else going once all right great

00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:35,850
he has a question though you want to

00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,850
come up and ask the question

00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:00,470
it depends on you know I think for for

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,290
engineers it's it's less sticky but you

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:06,230
know it depends on how flawed friendly

00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:09,350
the the people in I had to call them the

00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:11,690
suits but you know a lot of times people

00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:14,000
in marketing or very much into you know

00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,070
PowerPoint presentations and you know

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,320
very shiny things that are not running

00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:20,630
on a linux desktop I think that is

00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,980
probably the biggest barrier I don't

00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,380
really think that there's a big

00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,060
technical barrier you know in terms of

00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:29,360
you know feature parity between the two

00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,340
it's you know are these folks going to

00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:37,880
actually be able to use the tool because

00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:40,820
it's on a linux desktop well you can if

00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,620
you are not a person who is like typing

00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,970
things into it yeah there's web you is

00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,270
there's all sort you know you can look

00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:49,370
at its stuff there but yeah you know I

00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:51,260
think it just depends on what those

00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,760
people are doing with it you know if

00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,160
they have to come and sit and you know

00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,050
type things in you know provide their

00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,780
pieces of the schedule or if the person

00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:01,660
who maintains the schedule is in a part

00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,050
of the organization that is not

00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:07,370
engineering basically yeah that might be

00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,940
I'm actually trying to remember if test

00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:12,110
regular may actually have a windows

00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,200
version and it probably says on task

00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:19,750
Doug lorg which I would get to on the

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,750
internet later

00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:32,029
whoo can I stand here and just do this

00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:32,029
well then

00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,570
you

00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:13,850
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:15,830
ago we could not have imagined that

00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,020
asterisk would not only become the most

00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:20,150
widely adopted open source communication

00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:22,190
software on the planet but that it would

00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,710
impact the entire industry in the way

00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:26,690
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:29,330
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,280
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:33,380
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,790
transition of power from the hands of

00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:37,040
the traditional proprietary phone

00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:39,440
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,510
administrators of phone systems using

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,160
this power our customers have traded all

00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:45,260
sorts of business changing applications

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,060
from small office phone systems to

00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,160
mission-critical call centers the

00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,990
international carrier networks in fact

00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,460
there's even an entire country those

00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,920
communications infrastructure runs on

00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:56,840
esters the gym has always been about

00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,550
creating technology that expands

00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,710
communications capabilities in ways that

00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,910
we could never have imagined and that's

00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:04,310
part of what's game-changing about

00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:07,010
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:09,110
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:11,210
IP phones that extends control of the

00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,980
user all the way to the desktop the

00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,690
launch of these new products represents

00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,790
the next phase indigenous history of

00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:19,190
innovation these are the first and only

00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,900
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,430
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,470
our expectations for building a family

00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,630
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:28,370
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,990
the team to build the phones such that

00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,210
they were easy to install integrate

00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:34,040
provision in use I think you'll soon

00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:36,620
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,240
that goal user feedback is validating

00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,370
that when it comes to operation with

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,770
astro space systems including our own

00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:45,350
Switchvox based product these are the

00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,670
easiest to use best integrated most

00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:49,250
interoperable products on the market

00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:51,250
today the digitally phones will

00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:53,300
initially include three IP des hommes

00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,250
uniquely designed to complement any

00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,110
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:59,780
these phones are different for a number

00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:02,420
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,860
designed for use with esters secondly

00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,470
we've made it really easy to

00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,880
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,950
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,900
to access information inside of asterisk

00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,490
allowing tight coupling between an

00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,480
application and

00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:17,640
additionally we've created an

00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,770
applications engine that allows users

00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,980
and developers to create and run their

00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,780
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,730
done all of this at a very compelling

00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,410
price point at Digium we're always

00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:30,510
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:33,030
the best value in business phone systems

00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,619
and also give them the power to create

00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,750
their own solutions or any

00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:38,490
communications challenge well continue

00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,900
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,970
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,589
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:46,050
asterisk and web communications even

00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:49,760
easier and together we'll change the way

00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:49,760
the world communication again

00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:07,000
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:09,160
way to better utilize all your resources

00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,610
and it makes managing all your resources

00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:16,440
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:19,930
happening in open source the

00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,760
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,680
of the community and the speed at which

00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,870
these are these you know these

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,180
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:30,790
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,490
that really shows the power of the you

00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:35,110
know of the open source community it is

00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:39,310
global and it's definitely because of

00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:45,640
the users community people are extremely

00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:47,380
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,840
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,950
these guys helping each other out and

00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,860
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:55,690
manner the product is transparent for

00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:59,710
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:01,930
base everyone can see how close that is

00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:07,780
being built nothing nothing is

00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:10,420
proprietary everything is open in many

00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:14,620
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:18,400
unborn health cloudstack the most

00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:22,210
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,940
was our first developer boot camp

00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:27,609
and our call gave people a give me two

00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:31,540
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:35,740
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:38,560
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:41,080
chairs in the room twice everything

00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:44,349
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:47,410
is open source and so I don't think that

00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:49,180
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:52,210
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:54,760
computing and so i think it's i think

00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:56,260
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:00,000
about cloud computing you're really

00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,000
talking about a source cloud computing

01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:06,339
cloud zac is a robust solution for large

01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:08,710
deployments you'll have dozens of data

01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:12,670
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:16,000
data center is these hardware is going

01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:19,240
to fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,700
handle number one that mass scale number

01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,430
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:26,680
that inevitably happens in large

01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:30,520
deployments we started working on

01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:33,849
contact over four years ago and it was

01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:36,520
the original set of people working on it

01:00:33,849 --> 01:00:40,630
had a background of delivering software

01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:44,890
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:48,490
lots of users actually using it high

01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:51,580
availability is a key feature multiple

01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:53,589
hypervisors support different network

01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,260
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:58,540
you better while step management server

01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:02,230
can be deployed in different physical

01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,880
machines it definitely has a huge

01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:08,859
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:11,440
there's a major movie studio that they

01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:14,650
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,720
to transcode video and I thought that

01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:18,369
was terribly fascinating what I found

01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,640
more fascinating is what they did during

01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:24,430
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,780
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,380
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,500
the instance

01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:31,900
isn't compactor doing a little work

01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,430
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,380
different aspects and there's no one

01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:38,250
person that's kind of like a master of

01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:41,740
all those realms I think cloudstack as a

01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:43,960
project is going to be one of the

01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:48,040
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:53,470
most feature fallen and and robust

01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:56,370
platforms out they were I don't senior

01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:56,370
living through the clouds dag

01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,210
