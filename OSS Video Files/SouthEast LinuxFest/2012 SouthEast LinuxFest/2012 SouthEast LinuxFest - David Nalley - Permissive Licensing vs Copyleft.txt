the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,069
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,440
charlotte north carolina it is licensed

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,120
under a creative commons license for

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,609
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,470
linux fest visit www.azpbs.org the

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,350
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,859
the following diamond sponsors in 2012

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,539
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,789
so i guess we'll go ahead and get

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,109
started first of all are there any

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:37,610
people who would self described

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:40,649
themselves as license geeks awesome so

00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,870
this is a small relatively intimate

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,520
crowd so feel free to make this a

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,390
conversation no one wants to hear me

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,550
rattle on for an hour my name is david

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,140
nalli my contact informations there i

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,930
currently work on an imp aid to work on

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,000
a project called Apache CloudStack which

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,250
is a infrastructure-as-a-service cloud

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,810
platform and one of the reasons that

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,450
that I pitch this talk is that we may

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,570
recently made the jump from GPL to ASO

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,080
which is a copyleft to a permissive

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,700
license I'm also a contributor to the

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,090
Fedora project and do a number of things

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,210
there I'm a recovering sysadmin that

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,400
probably doesn't mean anything here and

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,140
i am a maker of ugly slides there's

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,820
nothing that you will see from my slides

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:37,049
that is aesthetically pleasing so I will

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,150
apologize and so so let's start out with

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,659
with why we bother with licensing at all

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:47,840
and and i think that there's a deep

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,070
history of both pride i think that

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,990
particularly when we essentially have an

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,240
economy of plenty for most of the people

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,570
who are writing open source code that

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,880
the pride in their work and the

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,939
credibility that they get from creating

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,350
things stops some people from just

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,090
saying do whatever you want with it

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,979
there's also you know some some

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,900
particularly thorny issues once you

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,420
escape the united states with public

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,269
mean and so public domain is not enough

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,480
and we'll talk about some of the reasons

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:25,110
why it's not enough in a bit so for

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,500
those of you who aren't licensing geeks

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,220
and I'm sure there are there are a few

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:36,030
here copyleft which typically that the

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,640
prime example there is the GPL it says

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,379
and of course not verbatim but it says

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,299
that users are free to do whatever they

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,720
wish they can use it in any manner they

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:48,180
want developers are free to do whatever

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,190
they wish with the code is well they can

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,549
go and hack on it they can change it

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,889
they can modify it distributors however

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,689
and a distributor is someone who hands

00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,989
out the software whether physically or

00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,510
electronically any changes that they

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,000
make under if it's under a copyleft

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,569
license those must be available to the

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,629
people that they distribute that to most

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:16,889
of the time most people in practice make

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:19,829
those changes available to everyone any

00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,260
confusion about copy left so far all

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:27,780
right so let's talk about permissive

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,010
licensing generally speaking and the

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,409
caveat will come in just a minute but

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,959
generally speaking users are also free

00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,959
to do whatever they wish developers are

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,459
free to do whatever they wish

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,409
distributors are free to do whatever

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,169
they wish up to and including typically

00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:49,650
sub-licensing or relicensing the code

00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:53,370
the caveat here is that you typically

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:59,099
have to at least preserve preserve

00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,590
attribution you also may have some of

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:04,109
the permissive licensing also require

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,690
you to if you're changing it that you

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:10,680
also change the name unless you have

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:13,530
permission to not do so anyone confused

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,459
about permissive licensing tell me even

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,459
what your confusion is

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,390
yes they they do not have to pass on

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:28,090
changes they can actually make changes

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,760
keep them completely proprietary sell

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:36,460
your your open source project as a

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:40,840
proprietary Lee licensed for effectively

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,790
and never contribute back and now we

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,400
have just had another license geek who

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:50,020
used to work for the FSF walk in so I

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,820
feel like I am doing a poor job with

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,980
this presentation now because there are

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,840
tons of licensed geeks and the FSF in

00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:01,360
the house so in the old days permissive

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,820
behavior was the default there weren't

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,140
really licenses because people were

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,670
selling you the hardware and the

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,990
software was just something that came

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:13,540
along with it and you by definition you

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,030
received the source code with it and

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,940
many times it was it was going to be an

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,250
assembler anyway and so you would you

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,280
would receive the source code that came

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,980
along with it and this changed when

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,510
Xerox decided to piss off a free

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,350
software hippie who didn't know he was a

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:37,690
free software hippie yet in in Cambridge

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:40,090
Massachusetts so Richard Stallman was

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,290
living quite happily in the AI lab at

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:46,870
MIT and they continually had problems

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,330
with printer jams and he wanted to

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:53,290
rewrite a driver and he asked Xerox for

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:55,390
it and Chirac said well that's

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:59,740
proprietary we can't share that with you

00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:03,910
and he seems to list this as his

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:07,210
defining moment when when you know the

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,060
the Seas clouds parted and he was able

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:12,160
to do you actually look and see hey

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,330
there's a problem and I need to to make

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,130
a an effort at fixing this and so one of

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,270
his software projects was the first to

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,390
bear a GPL license and he has led the

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:29,169
FSF and led a lot of licensing debates

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,330
particularly around free software so

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,550
Xerox

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:39,660
essentially started the copyleft

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,660
movement basically by pissing people off

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,760
so Xerox didn't want to play nice and

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,710
let people fix their problems and and

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,550
RMS felt the need to protect against the

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,860
art the Xerox types of the world and if

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,010
if you read some of his writings he

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:04,090
talks about the diminishing hacker ethic

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:07,110
at the AI labs and and he was

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:13,030
essentially trying to force that type of

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:17,890
of sharing ethic back into into the

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:20,020
software world so the GPL is great it

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,419
requires people to essentially share

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,780
alike there's a Content license by

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:29,140
Creative Commons that I think

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,419
colloquially puts it as you tell people

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,970
who did it and and you share your

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,150
changes just like the original was

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:43,000
shared with you they call that CC by

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:46,870
share alike but we continue to move move

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,130
along and as technology changed a lot of

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,440
the original terms of the GPL simply

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,900
became outdated and GPL too has been

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,979
with us for quite a long time we've had

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,510
we've had a number of things that have

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:07,360
really crept up and started creating

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:11,650
problems since gplv2 the biggest one is

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,130
software patents and so both permissive

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,590
license is now the the apache software

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,700
license and the GPL have patent sections

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:24,850
now to deal with that we also ran into a

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,669
problem where really smart people were

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,130
taking open-source software and they

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,990
were making billions off of it by

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,120
leveraging that plus a little bit of

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,839
their own code and under the traditional

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,120
source type of open-source license they

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
weren't require to release their code

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,480
even if it interacted because they were

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:49,129
never distributing it

00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:53,839
and so I call this the the ass ification

00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:59,329
of software so it's made as a service

00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:03,430
and when it's made as a service it it

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:05,870
all sits on one vendors hardware and the

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,149
the end users interacting with it but

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,970
never actually possesses the software so

00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,160
there's no need even if you're using GPL

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,360
software and start making changes you're

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,100
not distributing so you're not

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,439
triggering the clause that requires you

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,879
to change that are to distribute your

00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:28,639
changes and then we have tivo ization

00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:31,430
and tivo ization essentially tivo anyone

00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:35,209
here not know who tivo is it's now out

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,790
of out of pop culture but I don't know

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:40,149
how far it's our tivo essentially

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,709
wouldn't allow you even though they were

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,329
they were publishing what changes they

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:48,350
were making their hardware would not

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,420
allow you to make changes and still run

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,500
that that modified code on their

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,540
hardware and so these are an example of

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
things that that started happening that

00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,990
were noticed by the free software

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,870
community and the open source community

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:07,550
for that matter and and people started

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,680
effectively with gplv3 addressing these

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,750
and and to a lesser degree with some of

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,160
the other licenses anyone not know the

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:18,920
difference between free software and

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:20,240
open source okay good I wasn't going to

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:29,930
tell you what it was anyway I'd make

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:32,730
someone else do it but so yes we can do

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:39,310
that as a ball right

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:42,430
so so I've had some I have generally

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:46,180
speaking been on the side of a free

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:50,470
software or open-source developer and so

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:53,230
my my perspective was always typically

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,820
that the GPL is awesome you know not

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,710
least of which is because there are

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,310
people who are smarter than I am who are

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:06,400
using the software and I want to benefit

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:09,070
from their changes but individuals and

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,710
certainly free and open source software

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:15,880
developers do not the world make and

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,610
companies make a lot of decisions about

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,600
what software is used and generally

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,100
speaking especially with licensing

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,740
lawyers make a lot of those policy

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,090
decisions about what licenses you should

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,370
have if you've been around for any let

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,290
the time you'll remember that Linux used

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,030
to scare people people used to say if

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,410
you use Linux you'll have to give all of

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:44,710
your code to the internet because it's

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,560
viral and it's infectious and you can't

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,220
let any of it getting involved in any of

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,620
your enterprise and there was lots of

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,660
fear uncertainty and doubt that was

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:01,540
going around much of that still exists

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:04,060
today I still see on on mailing lists

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,940
people that say I cannot use the my

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,220
sequel database because any data that I

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,280
put into my sequel database I have to

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:17,110
share because that's the terms of the

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:19,840
GPL and and it literally scares people

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,910
to death that that they have to and and

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,920
while I'm not necessarily advocating for

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:30,190
my sequel that's quite honestly absurd

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,820
and and it doesn't help that that is

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,380
still proclaimed by a lot of people who

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,050
who ironically claim to be licensed

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,690
geeks so if you think that the GPL

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,870
requires you to share data that are

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:46,230
programs that you change

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,850
let's correct that now and and

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,210
essentially if you if you distribute

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,770
software if you take for instance my

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,650
sequel and you change how my sequel

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,740
handles your data and you're modifying

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:03,130
that particular code and you distribute

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,279
it as something like Maria dB yes you

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:09,250
must share your changes if that's not

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:12,010
the case then you probably do not have

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,390
to share your changes if you're keeping

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,310
that all in-house and you want to muck

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,380
around with how my sequel deals with

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:21,250
your data because you're smarter about

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,630
it then oracle is now feel feel free to

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,220
keep those changes to yourself there's

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:29,110
no legal obligation there the gplv3

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,790
still scares a lot of lawyers especially

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,720
corporate lawyers who are not free

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:40,960
software lawyers I have a conversation

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:44,110
with the CTO in a fortune 500 technology

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,560
company who incidentally sells lots of

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:53,709
products based on open source and gplv3

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:59,070
was completely off limits there are

00:13:53,709 --> 00:14:01,900
there are companies that employ tens of

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,990
kernel developers who actively commit to

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,050
the Linux kernel whose lawyers say thou

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,520
shalt not bring any gplv3 software into

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:14,740
this enterprise period no no you can go

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,400
get permission from someone else it is

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,450
completely off off bounds a lot of that

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:25,300
is is but a lot of that is people

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:31,930
reading the patent section of the gplv3

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:34,270
and are absolutely terrified and and

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,790
honestly I'm actually surprised I

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,760
thought that we had gotten past a lot of

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,310
those issues with gplv2 but people are

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,010
absolutely that the new scare it used to

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,600
be that if you allow GPL software in all

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,070
of your other software will become

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,970
infected and you will have to share it

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,680
now it's if you allow the ppl in all of

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,870
your patents will become infected and

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,300
you must essentially license the patents

00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,000
to the

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,500
old and so if you are a technology

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,400
company particularly a technology

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,420
company with a patent portfolio this

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,890
shouldn't scare you because you

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,060
shouldn't be patent seeing software in

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:14,660
the first place but this this absolutely

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,750
terrifies people so causing a lot of

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,340
problems there are some I talked about

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:26,570
in this arms race the classification of

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:28,540
us free software there's a special type

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,190
of GPL license called the affero GPL

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,280
that says if you provide a public

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,980
offering based upon software that's

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,970
licensed under the affero GPL you must

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,650
share your your changes as well I will

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,440
tell you that that scarce assignments

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,690
because they think oh I did a hotfix to

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,090
that application how soon do I have to

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:55,100
publish it what is the record-keeping

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,440
requirements around that I did something

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,410
and it wasn't it was in production for a

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,730
week and now I've ripped it out and

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,260
placed it with something else do I have

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:08,540
to keep that around four in number of

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:10,970
years so lots of there's honestly lots

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,590
of fear and I as a free software

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:17,000
developer I never saw any of those fears

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,710
until I got on the other side of that

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,810
where I was talking to people in

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,900
corporate departments who were trying to

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:30,080
deploy software i was writing and so I

00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:32,990
see the fear now and so from a free

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,840
software perspective this is where I was

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,290
making my my choices I was saying you

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,870
know do i hear a competitor or Forks of

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,420
a project because I can effectively I

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,090
can't stop a Fort but I can at least

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,900
force a fort to share changes that I can

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:53,810
also benefit from do I want my software

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,090
to become a standard because software

00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,880
that is considered a standard tends to

00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:02,950
be very liberally licensed you can

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:07,850
evidence that with apache and the apache

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:09,520
web server and some of the other some of

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,110
the other

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,150
pervasively distributed pieces of

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,339
software and as soon as I say that

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,630
people go yeah but the Linux kernel is

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:24,559
GPL and the de facto standard for file

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,569
sharing a Samba but typically people

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,600
find it easier to make something a

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,640
standard if it's if it is permissibly

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,549
licensed because there is less fear

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,429
around it a beer around adoption or at

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:40,390
least that's been my experience the

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:43,880
other is do you want to enforce freedom

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:47,690
ideologically I like the idea of saying

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,240
yes you can you can take my code and do

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,640
anything you want with it and please

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,919
help improve it and if you improve it

00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,260
make sure you share your your changes

00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:03,320
back a lot of people take that very

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:07,220
wrongly and I don't mean it to to come

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:13,600
off as you must share with me but it is

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:16,250
a it does provide a a true society where

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,260
if you benefit from something i do i

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,150
should also benefit from the

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,520
improvements that you make from it and

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,960
so that's my ideological my personal

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:30,919
ideological belief foremost for most

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,870
things i tend to be copy left-leaning so

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,669
now i'm going to talk about some of the

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,900
experiences that I didn't want to put in

00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:41,990
slides so i just i work on as i

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:46,610
mentioned i work on CloudStack we've had

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:48,679
for in excess of a year we have been

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,070
essentially debating this copy left

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,000
versus permissive licensing issue

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,530
internally and I'm going to sit down

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,659
because this should be a conversation

00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:01,429
not meet preaching at you and in the

00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:07,070
course of that conversation we've we've

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:08,600
had everything from airports the number

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,740
of people saying we don't even look at

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:18,890
you because of gplv3 and we don't think

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:21,049
that we don't think that you we don't

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,850
think that that license will work for us

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:24,010
corporate

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,570
and that's we're also not will in

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:31,030
addition to not adopting we're not

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:33,940
willing to contribute I personally was

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:37,059
very opposed to cloud stacks move to the

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:41,049
apache license because I have certain

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:44,530
ideological beliefs and at the same time

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:47,020
I can say that I have been shocked at

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,450
the number of people who have stepped up

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,230
and said hey now that you've got a

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,640
license that we can work with and also I

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,350
think there were some governance issues

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,850
around there now that you've got both a

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,150
license and the governance that we can

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,559
work with we are happy to contribute

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,539
which has really been shocking because I

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,490
i felt like i was saying this is going

00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,320
to be bad this is going to be bad we

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,110
made the switch and now it's all of this

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:15,820
is good all of this is good was I crying

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:19,480
wolf and and it was it was a very

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,090
interesting move there's only I think

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,070
there's only one other project that's

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,260
made that recently of any scale and

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:32,049
that's been puppet and puppet moved from

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:34,990
GPL to Apache as well and and they said

00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:37,419
you know in the end we want everybody in

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,909
the world to work with us we don't care

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:41,470
if they are contributing back or not

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:44,020
we're going to continue doing what we're

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,690
doing if they choose to for effectively

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,360
for or are actually for can create

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,100
another project that's one more person

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,130
that is at least thinking the way that

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,890
we think if not actually adopting

00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:00,580
everything that we're doing in the long

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:02,830
run it's an interesting thing anyone

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,700
have thoughts you guys have been silent

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,700
and just let me rant

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:41,130
yeah yes so so interestingly enough the

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,690
oh so to give you a brief background lon

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,460
open office open office used to be an

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,649
independent company that was building

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,870
star office they were acquired by Sun

00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:52,080
Sun continued selling star office but

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,389
made effectively the identical same

00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:00,149
thing available as open office and that

00:21:54,389 --> 00:22:02,279
was LG peeled yeah I I think originally

00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:07,559
it was lgpl so it was one of the weaker

00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:09,299
copyleft licenses right you're not

00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,529
you're up mutt you you're not modifying

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:19,340
the course you don't have to distribute

00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:21,299
changes and so there was Oracle had it

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,990
essentially there was a fort because

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:31,620
Oracle was not responsive enough are

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:32,879
non-responsive and Oracle then went and

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,929
said hey what do you guys want to do

00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:38,100
there are people who are running

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:40,049
commercial distributions like IBM and

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,629
IBM said yeah we would like for you to

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:45,090
continue supporting that and continue

00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:48,059
moving forward and they said well you

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,389
know we aren't really in the we're not

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,919
really in the software suite business

00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:54,750
and they turned it over to the apache

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,490
software foundation after the fork it

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,250
occurred and they had lost all of their

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,279
a lot of their mind share from the free

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:05,549
software community iBM has since

00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:09,059
contributed symphony all of the symphony

00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:11,490
stuff back into the code which I think's

00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,919
been a positive thing but I think it's

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,470
also IBM realizes that if they're going

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,120
to continue deploying symphony they have

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:22,129
to be a part of that solution because

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,129
Oracle has effectively abandoned it

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:38,940
yeah at least the paid developers yeah

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:41,730
yeah there's supposedly 60 people on

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:48,570
their committer project management

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:51,210
committee list right now yeah yeah it's

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:55,380
a small number but it's not it's

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:59,190
certainly not just IBM so you know what

00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,050
that whether that's a is that a failure

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,530
of wheat copyleft or is that a failure

00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,970
of Oracle or is that a is that

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:09,960
completely irrelevant to licensing I

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,640
don't know but I think yeah you were

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,110
going you were going that you didn't

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,330
trust it essentially because they had

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,900
forked it and we're doing things that

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,900
you couldn't see

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,289
sure

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:38,669
mm-hmm

00:24:46,710 --> 00:25:00,490
sure mm-hmm but permissive licensing

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:03,669
allows that to happen if someone takes

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:07,990
the permissive ly licensed software you

00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:12,309
you can still while you can with a

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:14,380
permissive ly licensed project you can

00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:17,740
release a binary and never release the

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,530
source in practice permissive ly

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:24,370
licensed projects tend to release their

00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:36,730
source at the same time and so yes you

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:46,080
can get away from the yet sure from the

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:46,080
from the people who are doing it yes

00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:53,139
yes

00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,430
you

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,419
sure

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,630
yes

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:37,910
right right right

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,700
but but the question

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,900
yeah but but Russell's of freedom hater

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,190
because he uses the iphone anyway so he

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,190
doesn't care about preserving freedom

00:27:48,460 --> 00:28:14,000
sure absolutely yeah because when you

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:17,870
incorporate pieces of copyleft software

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,990
then you also have to share so there was

00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:25,460
some sort of disingenuous study I no use

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:28,700
that word exactly earlier this year

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,650
saying that GPL use had declined and

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,270
then John Sullivan from the Free

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,390
Software Foundation looked into that and

00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,760
it's not the case the percentage of GPL

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,310
used compared to other licenses has

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,220
declined but the overall growth of free

00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,690
software continues to grow both

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:49,010
permissive license stuff and copyleft

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,540
license or so it's so the personal

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,030
decision like you know you can root your

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,370
phone or you can you know suck it up or

00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,800
if your office buys you an iPhone and

00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,200
you like having free as in costs stuff

00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,710
than whatever but the four mean the

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,110
larger issues like as a community what

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,240
do we want to do do we want to license

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,890
in a way that's intentional for the

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,830
overall growth of the community and I

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:15,650
think copyleft is the way to go so

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:18,860
ideologically I tend to agree I have I

00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:25,190
tend to think though that I've been that

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:27,260
my ideology is not necessarily misguided

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:31,310
but occasionally doesn't work out the

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:33,650
way that I think it would specifically

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,500
because we're making kind of the

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:39,260
assumption that that people will

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,450
continue to develop regardless of the

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,690
license change and I'm not sure that

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:46,040
that's true i'm not sure that and i say

00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,730
this because that's that's the result

00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,390
I've seen with

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:54,080
CloudStack if cloudstack had had the

00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:57,290
large number of people from from places

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,870
like GoDaddy and sun guard who had been

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,190
hacking on our GPL code we probably

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,120
would not have made the move to the

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:08,870
apache license and yet that has been one

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,169
of the effects is that yes people can

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:14,030
now take and close our source backup but

00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:18,110
there are also more people who are

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:20,510
working on on building on building open

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,549
source software now that it's Apache

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:26,480
License than they were when it was GPL

00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:29,720
so yeah you know it all so it kind of it

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,350
makes me wonder again like how corporate

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,570
attorneys get paid so much when it's i

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,059
don't i don't think that the version 3

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,850
of the GPL is that hard to parse and I'm

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:43,700
not an attorney but and it's not that

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,070
long it's longer than v2 but it's I mean

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:50,360
you know at Law School you have to do a

00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,679
lot of reading I here and so I I wonder

00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,020
where these folks are earning their keep

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,580
because if you know if someone wants to

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,940
pay me to sit around for hours and hours

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,340
and not read stuff that pertains to my

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:05,830
job then you know well I probably do

00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,830
something out so there but I cannot

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:52,080
the momentum towards a lot of lawyers

00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:55,110
and industries trying to push IP as you

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,180
know intellectual property as a law and

00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,730
trying to lump copyright and patents

00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,330
together and so now when they as soon as

00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,950
they see a push back through gplv3 then

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,450
they're kinda like whoa wait a second

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,490
what are we doing you know what's

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,290
happening here yeah and so it's kind of

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:24,410
like this kind of a double-edged sword

00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:24,410
on that absolutely I agree it's

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:46,179
yeah so so I've seen I've seen very

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,770
large hardware manufacturers that

00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:53,179
literally said we cannot even consider

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:55,880
your software because it's gplv3 and and

00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:59,230
it was absolutely eye-opening to me

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,970
because the person who told me that was

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,799
was a frequent contributor to open

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:08,299
source and he said our legal department

00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,470
simply will not have it we shipped yes

00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:13,600
they mentioned the patent Clause

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:16,610
specifically and they specifically cited

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:22,490
that they felt that the patent Clause

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:24,350
was viral in GPL and to the point that

00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:28,760
they said that they were afraid to even

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:30,980
use gplv3 software I'm like so you mean

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:36,429
you don't use Samba and they're like

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:40,520
well we use an old version of samba okay

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:42,650
so i don't i don't know that that the

00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,350
patent stuff really scares people I

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,320
don't know that maybe the tivo stuff

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:52,450
scares some hardware manufacturers but I

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:55,640
think the I think the patent stuff is is

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:58,610
really absolutely frightening and

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,900
lawyers you know lawyers are typically a

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:05,510
paid to to evaluate risk right and if

00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,600
it's a writ an unknown risk they tend to

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:12,619
go oh no they shall not do this rather

00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:15,080
than saying you have x % x percentage of

00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:17,060
being sued for doing this well i'm kind

00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,169
of curious then did these companies when

00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,149
when you know these people are telling

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,460
you this they say how many linux servers

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,100
they had because one of these about that

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,139
is being a collection of software parts

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,280
that are going to be gplv3 so they've

00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,480
actually really already introduced it

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,919
into their environment are these

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,510
companies going to have their lawyers go

00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,250
through the license on every single

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,350
package in the linux distribution before

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,960
they're allowing it to be no certainly

00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:42,169
requirement that this this particular

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,340
company though i would guess six or

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:46,730
seven figures

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:52,640
would be the total of pieces of Linux

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:55,610
hardware so yeah they're clearly not

00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,290
doing that for every single piece of

00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,870
software but when they're looking at

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,370
adopting a major piece of software it

00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,660
becomes a blocker because that's one of

00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,400
the checklist if it's something that

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,100
gets installed with the base install of

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,020
rail not only did they not know about it

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,000
but they probably haven't evaluated it

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,250
past the first time they evaluate a rail

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,290
and and of course they're getting

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:28,250
indemnification from Red Hat if they're

00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:33,760
installing rail to say it's it might not

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,760
but cash box says it's incredibly risky

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:49,760
yeah it's kind of humorous and respect

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:54,970
because in his league but but it very

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:58,700
much reminds me of of 10 or 15 years ago

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,870
when people said oh that's GPL best

00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,160
linux no must not have that scary

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:07,550
because it's the same type of reaction

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,590
and I understand that patents are

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:15,680
scarier than copyright but it's the same

00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:18,470
it's almost an instructor istic fear I

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,570
am clearly not a lawyer and I clearly

00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:27,250
don't evaluate risk for anybody other

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:27,250
than myself so you know yeah I need

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:09,750
at any time or have the reasonable

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:13,770
expectation that they should have the

00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:16,710
norton finally has the damage number is

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:19,050
awarded by the jury and trickle it

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,280
immediately two times three we're

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,840
talking about an errand wear it

00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,210
constantly come up at one hundred

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,210
million dollars in damage

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,390
so spot can you tell us what Red Hat's

00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,390
position on gplv3 years

00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,370
so what that means is that any time we

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,570
have anything that goes into fedora or

00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,260
redhead Enterprise Linux we are

00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:57,410
especially careful to be aware of

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,880
possible patent concerns with regards to

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,290
the software that we ship and you'll

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,350
look at the stuff we ship and you'll

00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,820
notice that big things are missing and

00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,230
I'm not going to go into details on that

00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,680
because you can google it just as well

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,690
as I can but we don't ship stuff that

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,630
other distribution ship because we are a

00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:19,010
much bigger patent target so

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:21,890
specifically with gplv3 do you do you

00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:24,590
act you yeah do you actively make

00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:27,230
decisions on what to contribute back

00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:32,270
into projects based upon their license

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:34,300
no okay interesting now I mean we don't

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:38,720
generally contribute to non-free

00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:41,060
projects no no I specifically mean if

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:46,100
you've got a gplv3 project do you say oh

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:48,380
we can't do that because no x no okay so

00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,450
there's not even a process by which you

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,010
evaluate your your folks are free to

00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,870
contribute to whatever basically the

00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,850
rule of thumb is is it a known approved

00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:59,410
free license if the answer is yes go

00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,410
forth and have fun okay

00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:19,120
you should ask spot he is the true

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,200
definition of a license key I think we

00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,400
have another we'd have to have another

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,900
session to go through all the

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,310
complexities of the patent license what

00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,750
I recommend that you do is if you go to

00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,460
the free software foundation's page

00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,230
there frequently asked questions page

00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,510
explaining what the patent what they

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,880
intend for the patent license to mean is

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,240
very clear it's very focused and it's a

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:41,020
good read so I would just defer to that

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:44,580
so I will tell you well again so that's

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,580
a rough question because yeah because

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,110
because what what what you have to when

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,350
you look at licensing or anything along

00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:55,690
this lines you have to have some sort of

00:40:53,350 --> 00:41:00,610
case law to answer what does it mean in

00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:02,740
practice and a lot of these cases gplv2

00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:06,490
doesn't have a any settled case on the

00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,630
United States so gplv3 definitely

00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,980
doesn't have any settled case along the

00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,070
United States now and other places

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,870
around the world that have similar but

00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,690
not identical jurisdictions to us namely

00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,850
Germany there are some case law

00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:22,720
references on how v2 is interpreted but

00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:24,700
again nothing on v3 so you could get

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,650
three lawyers in a room give them each

00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,880
identical copies of the gplv3 and I

00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,970
guarantee you each of them would give

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,200
you a different interpretation on it so

00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,940
what if you combine all of their

00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,460
interpretations you'll probably get

00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:40,120
something that looks a lot like what the

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,560
FSF is writing on yeah so so I will tell

00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,530
you that no corporate counsel that I

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:48,910
have dealt with agrees with the FSF s

00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:50,740
interpretation and well red hat does for

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,120
the record so there's at least one well

00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,500
okay so I've dealt with your corporate

00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,790
counsel I'm not dealt with them on GTA

00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:59,950
III I think to the point that we were

00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:03,910
ready to commission a study to get you

00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:07,230
know a number of legal scholars and pay

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:09,370
them money to render their opinion and

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:13,780
hopefully they would have enough weight

00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:15,490
in in society in the Legal Society for

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,410
people to feel more comfortable with

00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:21,460
whatever their assessment of what gplv3

00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:24,290
actually said and then we were

00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,089
short-circuited by the move to to the

00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,930
apache software license so it became a

00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:28,930
moot point then

00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:43,460
for but but no lawyer no lawyer agrees

00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:49,040
with any other law you're on anything

00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:51,050
unless there's case law right if I can

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,900
if I can point to if I can point to a

00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:56,720
case and I can give you a site that I

00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,460
can say here is precedent and we can

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,210
agree on that and everything else is

00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:04,070
really up for interpretation so I don't

00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,870
know that that's necessarily as dismal

00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:09,800
as you think it is although it's still

00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:10,850
pretty dismal the other thing to keep in

00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,560
mind with regards ending sort of

00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,940
licenses if you are the copyright holder

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,400
for something and you want to license it

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,510
under terms like the gplv3 for example

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,280
there's a certain amount of

00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:23,030
interpretation wait that's given to what

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,460
you believe the license means so if you

00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,200
read the gplv3 you read you have a

00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,180
lawyer who talks to through with you and

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,430
you come to the conclusion this is what

00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,500
this means of good piece of advice is to

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,810
document that in a separate location not

00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,270
to be confused with the license like on

00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:41,870
the website to say the license of this

00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,940
is gplv3 now this is what it means to me

00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,400
this is what how I interpret the patent

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,770
Clause what I expect from you when you

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,390
use this under these terms it doesn't

00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,880
mean the world it's not going to change

00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:55,790
existing case law but it goes a long way

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,860
if you go to trial and a judge says well

00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,350
this is what the copyright holder meant

00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,780
to do this is what they were trying to

00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,670
achieve so if you're in that position as

00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,470
strongly recommend that you take the

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,300
time to do that don't put it in the

00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,440
license because you're going to make

00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,850
yourself trouble if you start putting

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,070
your own interpretations of the license

00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:17,750
in the actual license because then the

00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:20,510
license actually eats itself but but but

00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:23,870
in a separate location say this is what

00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,130
I mean by this yeah so so that gets a

00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,800
little more complication you have

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,860
multiple copyright owners who are not

00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,540
the same entity that becomes a little

00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:37,300
more problematic

00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:40,090
actually change your license to 23 are

00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,710
you still like is that software still if

00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:48,609
they found like a weakness in two would

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:49,750
you still be suspect change one hundred

00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:51,040
percent you're the only copyright holder

00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,800
and you change everything to three it's

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,600
not v2 or later it's all three then

00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,740
you're not v2 anymore you're v3 so

00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,270
anything that would happen to v2

00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,900
wouldn't affect you because you run a

00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,900
different license

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:18,079
well so your your code from before that

00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,940
other people had under v2 they have

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,859
under v2 for the rest of their times it

00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,359
doesn't change that now you as the

00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:25,700
copyright holder can at any point in

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,650
time say and now the code is something

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,960
else and and usually that applies to

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,309
older licenses older versions of code

00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,289
but you're the copyright holder they can

00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:34,700
continue to use that license under the

00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:36,890
terms they got it under originally

00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,359
forever but you can pull it off your

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,529
website and say hey now all these old

00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:42,470
versions of the code I've gone through

00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:43,730
rely system v3 they're all v3 now it

00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,499
doesn't change what the guy had

00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,269
downloaded before about everything from

00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:48,980
that point that somebody got new is now

00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:52,009
under those new terms now to your

00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:55,249
specific point unless the vulnerability

00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:57,499
and the v2 license is inherited by v3

00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:59,869
because it has the same sort of text the

00:45:57,499 --> 00:46:02,839
same sort of flaw or ruling or case law

00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:04,400
also affects v3 in a similar fashion so

00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:06,319
only in that case would there be any

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,809
concern but simply because this one was

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,640
called v2 and this one was called v3 it

00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:18,460
doesn't inherit in unless it was

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:18,460
legitimately applicable yeah

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,660
yeah and software patents really have

00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:31,050
created a mess I mean to the point you

00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,750
know people are trying to build build

00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,510
their patent portfolios if for nothing

00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:41,940
else defensive purposes against against

00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:44,880
others so software patents are evil it's

00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,740
my opinion today that you cannot write

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,140
any software of any significant

00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,460
complexity without violating pounds you

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,680
can't toast bread either without

00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,180
violating 15 patents that cover toasting

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,740
the right and that's that's my opinion

00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,610
and not the opinion of my employer for

00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,440
the record yes by the way I am NOT

00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:06,990
speaking for my employer if I haven't

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,790
said that before I don't know that my

00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:13,580
employer has a public stance on the

00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:13,580
matter but if they did mine is not it so

00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:24,530
anything else we want to talk about we

00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:24,530
are what 45 minutes in so I'm yes sir

00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:50,750
so I think from a business perspective

00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:52,100
there's less fear around around

00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,830
permissive licenses because it

00:47:52,100 --> 00:48:00,220
essentially says you can do basically

00:47:54,830 --> 00:48:03,260
anything with a few exceptions unlike

00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,600
unlike copyleft which has this big

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,300
glaring exception that that people want

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,460
to expand past its boundaries so I think

00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:14,840
there's less fear and that people equate

00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:20,110
that to less risk and I think they also

00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:22,400
equate that to less obligation and I

00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,350
think from a business perspective those

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,540
are the big things and I may be

00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:30,710
forgetting something so anyone else feel

00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:33,770
free to chime in I think I think from a

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:36,860
contribution perspective it doesn't feel

00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:38,840
forced and I think that there are a

00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,760
certain class of people that don't like

00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,710
to be told that they must do something

00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,050
when they are doing it from their own

00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:48,320
free time and they're happy to do what

00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:51,800
they can but not not necessarily be told

00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:56,420
you will do XYZ or you're not in

00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:58,850
compliance with the license you know the

00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:02,030
the problem is is that the really the

00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:04,940
benefits of the Apache License are also

00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:10,640
the benefits from a user's perspective

00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:12,200
of the of the GPL in that a user and a

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,380
developer can do anything that they want

00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:21,050
and they just lose some of those

00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:26,660
potential downsides of force force

00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:30,640
exposure of their changes and and in the

00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:33,800
specific case of e3 the patent issues so

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,300
I don't know that there's necessarily a

00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,390
different set of plusses I think they're

00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:43,910
they're very very similar especially to

00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:47,210
an end user if you were you know I think

00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:50,650
that it's easier to perhaps get

00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:56,080
something standard and so

00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:59,500
I think of when when Red Hat started

00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:03,700
working with their big financial partner

00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:05,980
or big financial customer to do amqp one

00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,720
of the things they did was started

00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,970
contributing heavily to an Apache

00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,410
License implementation of an amqp system

00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:17,170
they wanted that too rapidly become a

00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,700
standard and one of the ways to do that

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,050
is make something that everyone can

00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,510
consume whether it's going to be

00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,400
proprietary or not and in that case you

00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:28,690
care less about the software and more

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,750
about the standard and I so I think you

00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:34,240
know it's easier to make to make a

00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:38,830
standard stick when when it can be more

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:41,500
ubiquitous and like I said earlier there

00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:43,750
are obviously counter examples like like

00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,850
Linux that show that that's not always

00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:49,000
true but I think it I think it's

00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:52,300
probably less work for most pieces of

00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,320
software if they care less about freedom

00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,320
and more about ubiquity

00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:39,870
I certainly can I'm I'm a little scared

00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:43,270
about your statement of pragmatism and

00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:46,000
here's why pragmatism scares me without

00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:50,140
the zealots of the world if there were

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,170
no Bradley kuhn and an RMS I would be

00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:56,290
the next sell it right because while my

00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:59,590
while my views are pragmatic compared to

00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:02,500
theirs which are much closer to the

00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:04,360
zealot into the spectrum if they were

00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,210
not setting the spectrum as being that

00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,760
far out then where I am would probably

00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:11,890
be considered the zealot perspective and

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,830
certainly from a business perspective

00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:19,480
I'm considered to be a zealot and so I

00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:22,810
think I do think that the zealots push

00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,210
us to push us in the direction that we

00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:27,790
need to go and without them we would not

00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:30,220
we would not have made anywhere near the

00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:31,930
progress from a way of thinking about

00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,590
free software and open source that we do

00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:39,550
now so I think I think in many ways the

00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:43,600
zealots are incredibly necessary as a

00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:46,270
part of that ecosystem not everyone's

00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:49,090
going to be there and probably nowhere

00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:52,270
close to everyone but I do think they

00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:54,340
serve a very valuable purpose can I

00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:57,910
sorry I just wanted to ask quick

00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:59,500
question just for clarification were you

00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:02,920
saying that pragmatism is good because

00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,330
it allows people to release vulnerable

00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,630
software without people being able to

00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:12,030
see it or I mean what like I don't

00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:12,030
understand the point for them

00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,599
okay are you sure

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,579
when you start dealing with with certain

00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:55,230
customers you get into a it now I'm okay

00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:58,440
with the risk of it not being fully

00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:01,530
audited if you have a copyright a

00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:13,160
copyleft style license you can't do it

00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:27,230
in that order not safer so much as

00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:30,869
quicker I need this product now I'm well

00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:32,609
I've certainly seen the case where the

00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:38,369
source is representing what I'm trying

00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:41,069
to say but um it's it's it's very much a

00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:45,690
you get into a chicken and an egg style

00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:49,700
problem and and then it yes in an ideal

00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:51,780
world and and and that's you would have

00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:55,589
multiple eyes you know multiple eyes

00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:57,630
make make bugs shallow and and that you

00:55:55,589 --> 00:56:01,430
know there's that the whole open source

00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,430
ecosystem thrives on that right and

00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:08,369
there's also if you have a more

00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:10,589
permissive license you can keep your

00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:14,849
secret sauce secret if you're putting it

00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:17,280
in a kernel level thing you can keep

00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:19,140
your secret sauce secret so your

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,520
competitors can't take it but then

00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:25,109
there's the things that you want to

00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:26,730
release back to the community no one can

00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:29,220
tell me what to do but I want to

00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:31,410
contribute back if I having a copyleft

00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:34,770
license my secret sauce is in that

00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:36,480
copyleft license as well and so it's an

00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:41,579
easy way of separating the two is I

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:45,140
guess what I'm trying to say yeah that

00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:45,140
and that's just the

00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,740
with

00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:23,059
anyone else wanna say something we've

00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,059
got two minutes left go ahead

00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:36,299
yeah yeah yeah so so your copy controls

00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,730
are not not exempt unless you're talking

00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:42,269
about drm like Hardwick true hardware

00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:46,259
stuff like you may not run you may not

00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:48,690
run exxon on my specific hardware even

00:57:46,259 --> 00:57:50,339
though I've this is GPL stuff you can't

00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:55,049
make it essentially impossible to run

00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:58,289
right so think Tebow yeah oh that's the

00:57:55,049 --> 00:58:00,509
tivo close yeah okay butBut tivo the

00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:04,019
tivo clause is essentially hardware drm

00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:05,819
right I mean it it's not salt it's not

00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:07,829
software drm but it's saying you may not

00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:13,470
run modified versions of software on

00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:15,539
this Hardware sir all right well so with

00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:18,749
less than two minutes left I will shut

00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:20,700
up I'm here all weekend so if you want

00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:25,650
to chat about licenses you should see

00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:26,849
Tom instead but if you are but I'm happy

00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,619
to talk to you about anything you wish

00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:30,619
so thanks very much

00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:47,079
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:49,270
way to better utilize all your resources

00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:52,720
and it makes managing all your resources

00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:56,549
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:58:52,720 --> 00:59:00,069
happening in open source the

00:58:56,549 --> 00:59:01,869
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:03,789
of the community and the speed at which

00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:05,950
these are these you know these

00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:08,260
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:11,109
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:14,109
that really shows the power of the of

00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:16,589
the open source community it is global

00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:20,109
and it's definitely because of the users

00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:25,750
community people are extremely friendly

00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:27,640
and they're always ready to help if you

00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:29,920
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,650
guys helping each other out and they're

00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,359
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:37,349
the product is transparent for everyone

00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:40,510
everyone can look at the code base

00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:42,780
everyone can see how close that is being

00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:48,279
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:50,920
everything is open in many ways it's

00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:55,359
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:59,559
health cloudstack the most exciting

00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:02,410
event in recent memory for me was our

00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:05,049
first developer boot camp

01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:07,690
and our call gave people a gave me two

01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:11,650
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:15,819
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:18,670
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:21,190
chairs in the room twice everything

01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:24,520
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:27,520
is open source and so I don't think that

01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,260
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,289
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,839
computing and so i think it's i think

01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:36,369
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,480
about cloud computing you're really

01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:43,030
talking about open source cloud

01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:46,059
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:48,220
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:52,510
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:55,150
in each data centers these hardware is

01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:58,630
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:00:55,150 --> 01:01:01,359
to handle number one that mass scale

01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:04,510
number two it's designed to handle the

01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:06,789
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:10,599
deployments we started working on

01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:13,960
contact over four years ago and it was

01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:16,630
the original set of people working on it

01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:20,740
had a background of delivering software

01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:24,970
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:28,599
lots of users actually using it high

01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:31,660
availability is a key feature multiple

01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:33,700
hypervisors support different network

01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,369
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,619
you better well step management server

01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:42,309
can be deployed in different physical

01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:43,960
machines it definitely has a huge

01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:48,970
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:51,549
there's a major movie studio that they

01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:54,730
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:01:51,549 --> 01:01:56,829
to transcode video and I thought that

01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:58,480
was terribly fascinating what I found

01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:01,750
more fascinating is what they did during

01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,510
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,890
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,599
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:12,000
the instances and go back to doing

01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:13,529
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,390
different aspects and there's no one

01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:18,059
person that's kind of like a master of

01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:21,839
all those realms I think clouds stack as

01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:24,059
a project is going to be one of the

01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:28,140
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:33,569
most feature folan and and robust

01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:36,470
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:02:33,569 --> 01:02:36,470
living for the clouds dag

01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:22,099
Oh

01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:30,410
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,359
ago we could not have imagined that

01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,550
asterisk would not only become the most

01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:36,710
widely adopted open source communication

01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:38,720
software on the planet but that it would

01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:41,240
impact the entire industry in the way

01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,220
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,859
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:47,810
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:49,940
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:51,320
transition of power from the hands of

01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:53,599
the traditional proprietary phone

01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:56,000
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,070
administrators of phone systems using

01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,720
this power our customers have traded all

01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,790
sorts of business changing applications

01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,590
from small office phone systems to

01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:05,720
mission-critical call centers the

01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:07,520
international carrier networks in fact

01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,990
there's even an entire country those

01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,450
communications infrastructure runs on

01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:13,369
esters the gym has always been about

01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:15,080
creating technology that expands

01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:17,270
communications capabilities in ways that

01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,440
we could never have imagined and that's

01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:21,200
part of what's game-changing about

01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,540
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,640
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,740
IP phones that extends control of the

01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,510
user all the way to the desktop the

01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,220
launch of these new products represents

01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:33,200
the next phase indigenous history of

01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,720
innovation these are the first and only

01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,430
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,990
power of Astra's when we first discussed

01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,000
our expectations for building a family

01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:43,160
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,900
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,550
the team to build the phones such that

01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,740
they were easy to install integrate

01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:50,599
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,150
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,770
that goal user feedback is validating

01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,900
that when it comes to operation with

01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:59,330
Pastor space systems including our own

01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,880
Switchvox based product these are the

01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:03,200
easiest to use best integrated most

01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,780
interoperable products on the market

01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,790
today the digitally of phones will

01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,830
initially include three IP desk phones

01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:11,780
uniquely designed to complement any

01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:13,640
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,310
these phones are different for a number

01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,980
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:20,390
designed for use with asterisks secondly

01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:21,849
we've made it really easy to

01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:24,410
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:26,089
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:28,049
to access information inside of

01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:30,049
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:32,009
between an application and the phone

01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:34,170
additionally we've created an

01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:36,299
applications engine that allows users

01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:39,539
and developers to create and run their

01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:41,309
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:43,259
done all of this at a very compelling

01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:44,939
price point at Digium we're always

01:05:43,259 --> 01:05:47,039
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:05:44,939 --> 01:05:49,619
the best value in business phone systems

01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,269
and also give them the power to create

01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:53,309
their own solutions or eating

01:05:51,269 --> 01:05:55,019
communications challenge will continue

01:05:53,309 --> 01:05:56,429
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:58,499
Astra's cooler faster more

01:05:56,429 --> 01:06:00,119
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:05:58,499 --> 01:06:02,609
asterisk and what communications even

01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:06,319
easier and together we'll change the way

01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:06,319
