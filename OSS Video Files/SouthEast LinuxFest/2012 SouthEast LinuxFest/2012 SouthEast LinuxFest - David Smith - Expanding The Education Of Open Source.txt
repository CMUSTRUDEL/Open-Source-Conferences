the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit www.lend expense org

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:32,189
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:35,850
possible part time at nighttime I i

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,940
teach linux systems administration and

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,940
the fundamentals of linux open source is

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,710
something that i am an advocate of so

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,270
one of the things that i decided to do

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,059
today is to get more it's kind of what I

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,969
might say a different approach today to

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,289
teaching or not even teaching it's not a

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,510
technical session but more of an

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:04,799
educational session as to why we need to

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,470
promote open source an open source as we

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,549
all know that many of us know it's not

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,260
as present or available to the masses

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,680
it's available to the masses but

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,500
Microsoft seems to do a great push in

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,509
pushing their product here we go by word

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,640
of mouth but I can tell you one of the

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,820
things that when I say word of mouth if

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,740
we have a very strong community it's a

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,939
very strong open source community and

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,820
something that I believe that we should

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:38,610
push very not only openly but with force

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,430
one of the things that talking to you

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,840
about today in education with open

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:49,079
source teaching kids from the ages of

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,030
grade school all the way to college I

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,040
teach the college level right now but

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,570
I'm working my way into the junior high

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,939
schools teaching Linux for instance is

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,469
something where any child can learn and

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,530
these are one of the things that I'm

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,490
trying to promote too many adults that

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,759
have access to

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,250
young adults or even children why am I

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,840
saying that is because it opens so many

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,230
different doors let me give an example

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,910
Pandora's box has been open now that

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,370
more and more people understand for

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,500
instance cyber terrorism these are one

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,080
of the things that people don't realize

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,269
that if we don't get involved with

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,950
computers more and more as far as young

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,019
children are concerned or young adults

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,209
we're going to be losing behind the

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,430
curve even further now when I say that

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,959
let me let me try to back up a little

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:49,060
bit and be clear one of the things that

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,319
we lack okay is technology as far as in

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,750
the United States of Keeping Up with

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,370
other countries the BRIC countries

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:59,019
Brazil India China Russia those

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,880
countries right now are pretty far

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,680
advanced whether people want to

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,010
recognize it or not or realize it or not

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,019
they're very far advanced here on the

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,549
other hand you hear the quote unquote

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,620
and I'm being honest with you you hear

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,910
lip service and the lip service that you

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,370
hear all the time it's education

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,340
education education but nothing is

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,320
happening that is really making that

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:27,040
difference now one of the things that i

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:30,190
would say in pushing it is science and

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,220
math in science and math in the world we

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,370
are 17th in the world there's really no

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,810
excuse for that however if you go to the

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,220
people and legislature they'll tell you

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,170
over and over we're all we're doing what

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,410
we can we don't know that's not enough

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,079
okay everyone that's in this room that

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,600
works at open source has talents has a

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,940
ton of talent and what I'm trying to do

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,829
is to organize more and more with

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,560
different people to organize those

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,959
talents why is because in all honesty

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,380
open source can really in any country

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,750
not just this one alone can actually

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,940
revolutionize education and how can it

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,680
do so it's by just taking a simple

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:14,350
example learning about the kernel or

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,389
just development if you give kids the

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,639
opportunity to work and I'm just saying

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,180
kids when I say kids I'm older than you

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
think

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,880
a young adults even if they're 20 years

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,550
old you can give them the opportunity to

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,770
expand their horizons and not pigeonhole

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,500
them in one area in other words open

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,710
source or Linux for instance is not just

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,139
programming it's not just development

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,750
okay there there are many different

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,960
aspects of it so thus when you expose a

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,460
child to open source you'll see how many

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,320
different avenues with possibilities

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,210
that they can choose from it's not so

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,199
much where the classical education today

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,979
is somewhat inadequate a lot of teachers

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,389
or instructors are far removed from

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,750
understanding what computers are about

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:04,690
let alone open source now understand

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,000
where I'm coming from here is like I

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:12,849
said this is a different approach a lot

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,030
of kids today are diagnosed for instance

00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:18,699
with a DD or ADHD attention deficit

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,520
disorder but in all honesty let's take a

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:23,470
look and take a look at open source if

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,360
we did and I don't have enough pictures

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,830
to really show you today because this is

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,449
kind of acting a little bit funny i see

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,010
so on i'm going to try to give you a

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:36,010
visual imagination if you notice a lot

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,669
of kids today they are great not just

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,370
great excellent at video games excellent

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,139
at video games to the point and i can

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,430
budget by anybody in this room i bet you

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,770
there's some kids that are younger than

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,800
us and give us a run for our money now

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,229
if you notice this is a different

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,909
generation that we're dealing with when

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,900
I say we're dealing with as a group as a

00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:01,800
whole if you put a newspaper in front of

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:06,009
them or a book they can't comprehend it

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,289
why because it's static so what it is

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,570
it's you ever look at the eyes of an

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,400
young individual their eyes are

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,830
constantly moving what a video game is

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,620
constantly moving so their eyes follow

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,990
and if you notice they learn the levels

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,150
and the steps of each level inside that

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,690
game it goes higher and higher and

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,009
higher I can't get past the first level

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,870
but they can go all the way up to the

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,010
top and you know what they get bored

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,270
they have that's why they come out with

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,680
another game but if we put a book and

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,630
front of them they get stuck now the

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,510
question is okay well what do we do

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,360
about that well we need to expose them

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,840
to open source because it's constantly

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,460
in all honesty moving parts and they can

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,870
make it move you put it in front of them

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,340
they can fix it you can put a

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,270
PlayStation in front of them and they

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,270
can program it so therefore yes we have

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,030
the ability to let them make changes

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,130
however each individual in here has the

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,560
ability to help to instruct them and

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,200
give them the direction so that's where

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,960
we don't go wrong as a group we can

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,360
instruct them okay we can teach them the

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,390
fundamentals ok we can teaching the

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,100
fundamentals why it's not just i

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,830
mentioned that science and math are good

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,480
science and math and all honesty is in

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,050
just about anything and everything that

00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,570
we do so thus if you notice a lot of

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,980
times that schools push away kids from

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,020
science and math this is where you can

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,990
learn this you can hey I'm not taking

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,490
anything away from other subjects but I

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,410
would definitely say for instance are

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,600
you pushing a kid towards basket weave

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,630
and that's not going to work science and

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,040
math you need to be strong in and

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,500
computers it deals with nothing more

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,010
than science and math one of the things

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,850
I also realizes if you get a higher

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,560
certification or the higher that you go

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:58,580
in certification it doesn't have to be

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,050
open source you can be in you can deal

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,270
with Cisco networks you can go all the

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,980
way to the top but no Ilana see those

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,290
that really do well are really good at

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,840
math and science okay if you want to be

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,460
an architect in computers you have to

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,310
have math and sciences your background

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,890
so what do we have to do we have to

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,230
cultivate the culture the culture that

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:22,070
we have so at the same time you also

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:24,380
want to realize that young students do

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,480
have the opportunity to what go to

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,770
different sites now i only put some of

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,360
these sites up here on the board like I

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,160
said the computer here and trying to

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,570
turn back around it would just take too

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,100
much time these are educational

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,230
softwares but a lot of education today

00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,960
if you notice they talk about well our

00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:44,300
education educational software runs on

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,070
linux we're not interested in

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,370
on Linux really interested in teaching

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,660
them open source or Linux we're

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,640
interested in teaching and show them how

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,920
it works because we can show them how it

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,570
works there is a giving an example the

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,430
government for instance and I'm not just

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,769
talking about jobs along the government

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,160
for instance is looking for what cyber

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:10,399
soldiers okay the cold term that you

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,250
hear in the media it says when they're

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,410
involved in a conflict they'll say well

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,620
you know what we will get involved but

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,269
no boots on the ground or no boots on

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,990
the ground what does that mean that's

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:27,140
cyber warfare that's what it is cyber

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,120
warfare and or drones so what it is

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,870
they're looking for talent they can't

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,279
find enough talent to help them forward

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:41,060
their mission and they have unstoppable

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,880
and ungodly amounts of money to spend to

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,350
make sure things can go in the interest

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,850
of for instance the United States could

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,130
be any country you could be China any

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,320
country but in this country so in other

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:56,660
words let me let me give you an example

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:59,750
it's like taking a scenario several

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,220
years ago when the Pentagon as everybody

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,920
knows how hard it is to break into the

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,620
Pentagon it was just you would be shot

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,660
before you get over the first gate okay

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,270
however to get through the front door

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,630
and get through the turn styles you need

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,250
all kind of clearances but not for one

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,110
man that was their back and I would say

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,079
it was silence somewhere around the time

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,720
around two thousand seven when he went

00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:26,180
into the parking lot okay of the

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,750
Department of Defense and inside the

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,750
Department of Defense

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,240
he had about maybe 50 or 60 flash drives

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,800
and what did he do he just threw them

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,260
all over the parking lot just threw him

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,970
all over the parking lot and he left and

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,660
what happens when people came back from

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,650
lunch oh look what I found here and what

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,290
happened they walked right through

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,870
security right through the front gate

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,000
inside of the Pentagon and just with no

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,370
problem and what did they what do they

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,780
normally a curious person is going to do

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,050
when they have something in and have

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,010
nothing to do a board employee stick it

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,510
right into the machine well then

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,360
everything broke loose all chaos broke

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,800
loose and they couldn't find where the

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,270
damage was coming from because it was

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,320
coming from different locations with

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,150
inside the organization now after they

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,950
finally found that they shut down all

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,320
the systems and they had to have removed

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,910
e drives and if you go into a lot of

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,200
government institutions going to a lot

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,980
of financial institutions you're not

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,650
even allowed to use flash drives anymore

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:37,130
it's not even not even allowed well

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:40,100
think about it we've changed so if we've

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,350
changed as far as what technology has

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,270
brought us we need to be able to keep up

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,370
with an open source is the greatest way

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,800
to catch catch the wind we don't have to

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,210
constantly pay a quote-unquote Microsoft

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,440
to try to keep up because every time we

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,470
try to do something they charge this

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,360
money I'm not going to hesitate and hold

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,710
back and say that's what they do every

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,710
time we turn around they want to charge

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:03,710
this money open source we share and

00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,320
since we share now at the time to take

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,010
advantage of that sharing it's too much

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,620
and I go back to that that cyber attack

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,050
that was used with the flash drives

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,910
think about today it's too hard and it's

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,310
too much trouble for me to jump over the

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,860
fence while I take the risk it's too

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,110
much effort when I can brute force hack

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,090
into your machine or your machine and I

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,790
think twice about it and take all your

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,430
information and that was the thing that

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,540
if you might touch on that later on with

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,370
Stuxnet okay in a flame virus okay these

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,380
are things that the government says

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,030
listen we need to protect ourselves why

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,130
because in the past them

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,590
that don't know if for instance for

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,260
those of you that remember when it's

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,770
when the Northeast and the southeast

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,360
they had an electrical power outage all

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,820
the way from the north and Canada all

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,310
the way down to Florida and what was the

00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,990
excuse that they used the excuse that

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,930
they used was or where we have an old

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,580
power grid oh really but did they ever

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,880
fix the power we know we just got it

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,400
working again no okay that is what

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,320
Stuxnet is it deals with industrial type

00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,790
viruses it goes right inside your system

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,130
and look for industrial plants and it

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,540
can shut down your entire infrastructure

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,090
so instead of having boots on the ground

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,390
why drop a bomb on a country and you can

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,000
kill maybe 100,000 when you can use a

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,910
cyber attack or a worm and get into

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,550
someone else's or country system and you

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,440
can disable their entire water

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,290
infrastructure their electrical grid

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,050
their nuclear power grid that's how

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:44,390
powerful it is so with the power of

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:48,250
teaching open source there are many

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:51,230
avenues of approach to bring not only

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,270
students up but there's country up as

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,160
well and this is the thing that I'm

00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,490
trying to get people to understand is we

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,860
can totally revolutionize the way that

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,510
we do education the way that we do still

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,380
earning in general and the way we do

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,730
things period because we don't need to

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,410
be charged a whole bunch of money we

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,030
have many different communities that are

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:16,190
out there that in fact that give you

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,740
free education and like I said I didn't

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,270
want to turn around with my back to you

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,470
and so I what I'll do is I'll just

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,410
continue because otherwise I have to

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,230
keep playing with but there are a lot of

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,450
students out there today that don't

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,950
realize when I say students or people

00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,080
that are interested in learning about

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,940
open source don't realize how many jobs

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,490
are really out there now I'm sure

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,860
everyone here has heard the news many

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,660
times over all the unemployment rate is

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,060
high or they're not enough jobs out

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,780
there everyone here and open source know

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,640
there are plenty of jobs and open source

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,150
education but jobs linux administrators

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,490
system administrators web developers

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,750
system pro

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:00,300
grammars okay linux unix is there and

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,100
then at the same time we don't take

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,279
advantage of the why because many people

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,459
don't know about it so we're trying to

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,250
gather as many different organizations

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,230
and you have some that are getting on

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:16,320
board IBM is getting on board or has

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,640
gotten on board there are a number of

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,370
different companies that have gotten on

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,750
board to actually promote it but it's

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,459
going to take a lot of time and it's

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,680
going to take a lot of effort one of the

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:31,310
things that I would say also about this

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,990
is you have the opportunity to use

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,339
computers that are very old a lot of

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,589
people say well I don't have a computer

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:41,010
you can use the oldest of computers and

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:42,570
run open source on it it doesn't matter

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:45,270
I mean I'm not saying something that's

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,830
15 years old I mean being realistic but

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,140
if your system is five years old you can

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,670
still keep it running it's beautiful

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:55,230
open source is something really really

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:57,750
really wonderful now to have something

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,500
like a for instance I'll give you an

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,420
example this is not this is not

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,540
computers but it's something let me see

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,950
here this is something similar that you

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,579
will probably all have heard of before

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:17,910
and like I said even it's slow even

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:19,440
though I it's a I just use Khan Academy

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,040
as an example if you notice in Khan

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:31,170
Academy they give you what they give you

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:34,110
free education for what for different of

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,870
course like I said for math science is

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,829
on this one website and when when it

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,880
finally looks to cooperate you'll be

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:46,020
able to see where it gives you free

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,760
calculus it gives you free all this kind

00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:53,450
of stuff here sending request is a

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,450
little slow here now

00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,899
well it's just my luck but anyway so

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,309
it's it's free education that they give

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,990
you and you're able to go there and you

00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,000
can learn science and you can learn math

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,360
the same thing that we can do for what

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,459
open source for computers okay it's just

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,169
slow today so we can't see it again but

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,120
with computers if we teach it and teach

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,589
it as it's free yes you can make money

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,189
there are other ways you can make money

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,470
but promote it okay promote it and

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:32,370
before I continue any questions before I

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:36,250
continue okay no pen all right fine so

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:39,610
there we go if you notice here for

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:42,370
instance you have algebra algebra

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,480
solving equations and this is all free

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:53,320
these give 10 minute videos of each okay

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:55,899
algebra graphics and this keeps on going

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,490
this is a one person has done this okay

00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:03,450
this is all algebra let me scroll down

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:07,360
some more just now you have arithmetic

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:13,029
okay and you have in this case he likes

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,220
art history but he has a calculus and

00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:17,470
all of that is free so what we need to

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,629
do is to do the same thing so that's the

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:23,710
project that right now I'm working on in

00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:26,320
order to create a portal for web videos

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,000
not a youtube type portal but a portal

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,240
that's organized where we can make that

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,009
education free okay where you can go up

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,500
there and you can learn about in this

00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:37,120
case I only use calculus for math skills

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,100
but I think you get the concept of what

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,789
I'm trying to bring across you can do it

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,549
for programming if you're learning mysql

00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:49,210
put it up then we can categorize it once

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,769
we categorize it okay then anybody and

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,320
everybody can go up there and see it for

00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:55,450
free okay and it doesn't matter what the

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,690
topic is and after a while it will grow

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:02,669
so this way it doesn't really cost us

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:05,340
much money to what promote this Avenue

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,109
or promote this Avenue of learning okay

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,989
I only use this because i don't have

00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:13,609
over 3000 he has over 200 million hits

00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:15,570
or downloads i should say 200 million i

00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:18,629
can't do all that he did this over a

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,059
number of six years seven years three

00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:22,409
thousand videos but if we all get

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,820
together and that's what I'm trying to

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:27,419
do is create a portal where we can all

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,129
do it and it's free now we're on top of

00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,960
it where we can actually teach each and

00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:35,429
every person that's in here and other

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:40,019
people to move forward so going further

00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:46,109
and everybody can see that that I know

00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:50,929
that it might be a little it might be a

00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:50,929
little and let me show you go down now

00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:58,470
one of the things that I also want you

00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:00,809
to be aware of and you might not

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,639
understand this let me go to the things

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,739
that you need to be careful of because

00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,869
one of the things that people can learn

00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:11,720
and open source is the do's and the

00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:15,600
don'ts and I'll take you to one test is

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:19,169
to take our education or our knowledge

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:25,139
for what we know okay and learn how to

00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:30,440
reverse engineer what we find now let me

00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:33,840
see well anyway i'm going to show you

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,070
test engine give an example what we need

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,480
to do with open sources to teach people

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:41,279
about malware scareware okay and adware

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,409
that's a whole nother approach for

00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,809
learning and teaching them and why it's

00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,369
important so an example there are many

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,019
different websites and i'll show you one

00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:53,279
that deals with this one called test

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:55,080
engine how to actually break down a site

00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,749
and find out whether or not it actually

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,369
can harm your computer or harm you in

00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,019
general i'll give you an example there's

00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,759
a site up there that still up there now

00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,830
it's called test engine i was up there

00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,419
trying to get certification you know for

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,029
the students and what i try to do is is

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,399
to pay for it i paid for and downloaded

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:12,809
a terrible virus on my system there's

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:15,389
ran right and it took over a hundred

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:16,230
dollars out of my account the thing is

00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:19,260
it's still

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:22,169
out there but if we teach the younger

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,940
generation today how to actually program

00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,280
instead of making them black hat we can

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,710
make them what they call white hat okay

00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,919
we can actually create our own what they

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,650
call cyber armies in order to defend

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,480
against this cyber terrorism I use this

00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,860
as a key example of time and time again

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,070
why is because it's not totally new but

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,350
its ever increasing its ever increasing

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,840
technology so now we are on a verge of a

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,090
technological edge so how do we get to

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:55,320
the forefront of it is by what making

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:57,090
ourselves cyber soldiers okay so if you

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,100
have any ideas or anything that you

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,169
would like to contribute that's what we

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,490
look for okay and that's what we're

00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,250
creating and that's what we're looking

00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,140
to talk about and will be coordinating

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,390
with number of different corporations

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,980
and they're looking forward to it but

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,860
what I'm looking for more are

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,929
individuals because you it's not about

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,049
having people even try to throw money at

00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:22,040
the situation is to have people learn

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:27,210
okay and that's that's the premise of

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:36,740
questions we oh I'm sorry I'm sorry

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:39,809
sorry no um ok no problem we deal with a

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,290
cesspool fool.com is what it is we're

00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:46,410
we're reorganizing is really a spoonful

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:49,410
org and what is designed for is it's not

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,450
really a up and running site right now

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,090
it's just something right now that there

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:56,669
is in its in the making ok but it's

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,919
designed to feed people a spoonful of

00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:00,630
knowledge at a time and that's what open

00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,850
source is about is giving people

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,260
knowledge of spoonful at a time so once

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,690
we are able to get that up and running

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,340
what we're going to do is provide videos

00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,850
that are free the same way we showed you

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,590
there before and promote it for from K

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,419
through 12 and all the way through

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,419
college that's the design

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,620
well if you're doing that why don't you

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:28,200
grab the coattails like Khan Academy and

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:31,590
put your videos there cuz they already

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,050
get thousands that is a great a great

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,060
question um the gentleman here said why

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,660
don't we grab the coattails of Khan

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,000
Academy and go from there I've tried

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,940
that okay I'm going to tell you a couple

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,070
of things that go with that one no

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,530
that's that's okay one of the things is

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,110
their kind of fixed in the way that

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,310
they're doing things and having people

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,170
this is I'm going to tell you one of the

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:58,950
complications of it all it's my

00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:01,200
background is legal to one of the things

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,890
is having too many different

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,190
contributors runs them into a legal

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,320
problem of copyright okay so what

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,850
they've done with Khan as I gave you an

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,920
example since he did all the videos by

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,380
himself he was able to give it to

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,670
Microsoft or Microsoft able to give him

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,430
two million dollar grant but he's also

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:23,160
able to now promote it through Microsoft

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,510
as his own content they don't have to go

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:32,780
through a whole bunch of people and go

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:38,130
through publishing rights yes I'm sorry

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:44,070
great then it doesn't that's correct on

00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:46,050
one second I agree with you right they

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,120
don't want to they don't want to give

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,820
that out okay didn't want to give that

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,100
out so that's that's something that we

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,520
have to create our own okay but then

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,200
again and one of the things i do say is

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,700
you can see I hopefully hope that you

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,620
see that there's plenty of opportunity

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,340
and it's that there's plenty of avenue

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:07,800
of excelling in this Avenue of education

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,640
the thing is we're just trying to gather

00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,640
a group yes

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,900
just with the programming language ok I

00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:29,350
just learned of something oh ok question

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:38,910
I'm sorry this I call show me do ok dot

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:38,910
com yes I'm sorry I'm sorry you wanna oh

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:53,020
I'm sorry ok yes I apologize there is a

00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:57,370
site called show me do calm ok show me

00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:00,840
do calm that will do something similar

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,840
to answer what we were discussing today

00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:06,040
and it's from what the gentleman was

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,270
saying it's more for programming

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,200
languages but we can do it for

00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,940
everything we doesn't have to be just

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,460
for programming agree for developers we

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,950
can put them all in one big location and

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,180
then we can go from there that's that's

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,280
the avenue of approach that we're

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,140
looking to and everybody in anybody is

00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,690
willing to contribute it's a community

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,150
ok that we're creating ok yes its

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,160
inception stages it's not about making

00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,470
money or anything of that nature it's

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:35,100
nonprofit and it's just to excel and

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:38,380
help us move forward any other questions

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:43,210
No ok what thank you very much I'm not

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,430
going to Wow ok so kept that smaller and

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:52,920
if I have more actually hold on one

00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:52,920
second let me see hold on

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,980
let me talk about

00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:18,300
see ya okay now like I said it doesn't

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,040
work but anyway not to keep you sorry

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,600
for the technical difficulty that I'm

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,130
having that because my internet just

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,020
won't go and this way i would show you

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,300
different sites but one of the things

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,030
that we also want to promote to show you

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,720
that there's so many different jobs that

00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,630
are available for linux and i use linux

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,280
as a term but you don't hear people here

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,070
today in this conference here using the

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,250
word unix as much but it's something

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,200
that's available for kids k through 12

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,450
and that you can teach them and k

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,600
through 12 so if there's anyone that's

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,460
interested in trying to promote that

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,560
just see me outside in front and we can

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,690
make that happen thank you very much for

00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,690
for the time okay

00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,510
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,700
way to better utilize all your resources

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:50,150
and it makes managing all your resources

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,980
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:57,500
happening in open source the

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,299
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,220
of the community and the speed at which

00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,380
these are these you know these

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,690
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,539
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,539
that really shows the power of the of

00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:14,020
the open source community it is global

00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,539
and it's definitely because of the users

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:23,510
community people are extremely friendly

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:25,250
and always ready to help if you go on

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,380
tire see any day you'll see these guys

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,080
helping each other out and they're all

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,789
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,779
product is transparent for everyone

00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:37,940
everyone can look at the code base

00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:40,210
everyone can see how close that is being

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:45,710
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:48,350
everything is open in many ways it's

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:52,789
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:56,990
health I'll stack the most exciting

00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:59,850
event in recent memory for me was our

00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,490
first developer boot camp

00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,130
and our call gave people I gave me two

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:09,090
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:13,320
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:16,110
with 87 people and had to go get board

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,630
chairs in the room twice everything

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:21,960
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:24,929
is open source and so I don't think that

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,700
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:29,730
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,280
computing and so i think it's i think

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,809
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,520
about cloud computing you're really

00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:37,520
talking about a source cloud computing

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,860
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,260
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:50,280
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:53,549
data centers these hardware is going to

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:56,760
fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:59,250
handle number one that mass scale number

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,950
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:04,500
that inevitably happens in large

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:08,039
deployments started working on college

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,370
attack over four years ago and it was

00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:14,070
the original set of people working on it

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:18,179
had a background of delivering software

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:22,409
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:26,010
lots of users actually using it high

00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:29,100
availability is the key feature multiple

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,110
hypervisors support different network

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,809
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,059
you better while staff management server

00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:39,750
can be deployed in different physical

00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:41,400
machines it definitely has a huge

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:46,380
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:48,990
there's a major movie studio that they

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,260
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,240
to transcode video and i thought that

00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,890
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,159
more fascinating is what they did during

00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:01,950
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,330
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,900
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,020
the instance

00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,420
isn't compacted doing real work

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,950
CloudStack is vast it touches so many

00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,810
different aspects and there's no one

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,480
person that's kind of like a master of

00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:19,260
all those realms I think clouds stack as

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,510
a project is going to be one of the

00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,560
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:30,990
most feature folan and and robust

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:33,890
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,890
living through the clouds dag

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,760
you

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,150
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:59,130
ago we could not have imagined that

00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,320
asterisk would not only become the most

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,480
widely adopted open source communication

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,490
software on the planet but that it would

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,010
impact the entire industry in the way

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,990
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,630
way into more than 170 countries and

00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,580
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,679
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,090
transition of power from the hands of

00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,370
the traditional proprietary phone

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,740
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,690
administrators of phone systems using

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,920
this power our customers have created

00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,870
all sorts of business changing

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,700
applications from small office phone

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,220
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,840
the international carrier networks in

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,610
fact there's even an entire country

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,220
those communications infrastructure runs

00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,140
on esters the gym has always been about

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,850
creating technology that expands

00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,040
communications capabilities in ways that

00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,210
we could never have imagined and that's

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,610
part of what's game-changing about

00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:50,309
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,410
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:54,510
IP phones that extends control of the

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,280
user all the way to the desktop the

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,990
launch of these new products represents

00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,090
the next phase indigenous history of

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,490
innovation these are the first and only

00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,200
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,760
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,770
our expectations for building a family

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,929
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,669
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,320
the team to build the phones such that

00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:15,510
they were easy to install integrate

00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,340
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,919
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,540
that goal user feedback is validating

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,669
that when it comes to operation with

00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,100
astro space systems including our own

00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:28,649
Switchvox based product these are the

00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,970
easiest to use best integrated most

00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,550
interoperable products on the market

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:34,550
today the digitally phones will

00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:36,600
initially include three IP des hommes

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,550
uniquely designed to complement any

00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,409
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,080
these phones are different for a number

00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,750
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,159
designed for use with esters secondly

00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,770
we've made it really easy to

00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,179
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,250
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,270
to access information inside of asterisk

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,820
allowing tight coupling

00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,710
application and the phone additionally

00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,990
we've created an applications engine

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,180
that allows users and developers to

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,790
create and run their own apps on the

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,040
following and finally we've done all of

00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,750
this at a very compelling price point at

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,940
Digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,310
give our customers the best value in

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,600
business phone systems and also give

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,700
them the power to create their own

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,500
solutions or any communications

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,180
challenge well continue to push the

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,950
boundaries not only to make Astra's

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,840
cooler faster and more technologically

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,270
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,590
communications even easier and together

00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:32,490
we'll change the way the world

00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,490
