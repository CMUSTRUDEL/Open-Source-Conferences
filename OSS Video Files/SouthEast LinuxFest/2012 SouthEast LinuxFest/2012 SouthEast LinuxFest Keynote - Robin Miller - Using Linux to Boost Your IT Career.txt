further ado rob limo I wish I was as

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,319
wonderful as I was just portrayed I'm

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,760
really as you can see I'm an old man I

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:24,790
live in a Florida retirees trailer park

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,180
with my dog and I get off the lawn sign

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:32,920
no I don't have one of those but we are

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:35,920
very simple livers in my 1994 jeep

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,950
cherokee is finally going to go to the

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,670
auto graveyard after many years of swamp

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,560
travel anyway today we're not going to

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,350
talk so much about jeeps we can do that

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,650
later i'm talking about using linux to

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,530
boost your IT career first i'm going to

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:59,290
sort a semi define or undefined IT

00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:02,230
career I've worked 40 s TG which is now

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,880
geek net primarily on slashdot and I

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,980
still do actually I'm done the guy who

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,400
does edits and produces a slashdot

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,980
videos good or bad I don't determine the

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,170
content I just make them clear and make

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,650
sure the cuts are right and that there's

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,389
background music when needed and I don't

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,579
decide that they should be delivered in

00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:23,579
flash only that's an executive error

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,799
but I don't want to hear it it just

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:34,629
doesn't make any difference to me I use

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:39,450
flesh I'm a bad man because the thing

00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:44,489
with linux and I t is programming IT

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:48,190
yeah is fixing somebody's computer IT

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:51,280
yeah about setting up a network that's

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,959
ID yeah yeah yeah yeah so it's really

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,799
hard I've been through this thing with

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,410
these people at OST G which was OSD n

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,359
which was and over net which is sort the

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:06,700
company they would always tell me we

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:09,599
want to not target developers as our

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,640
audience we wanted to target IT people

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,970
and I would constantly say what about

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,590
somebody does both and I said well we'll

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:23,460
have target them see that their thought

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,039
was people who are in IT buy things oh

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,220
let's call HP as hewlett-packard a

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:33,039
sponsor of this fine event thank you

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,220
love that computer or the printer the

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:40,750
Linux drivers work well and that it's

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,800
true I have one and the thing is none of

00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,450
them could ever get it through their

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:49,240
heads that programmer by night devel you

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,810
know IT person by day that there really

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,240
was total cross over and there's

00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:00,070
probably a lot of crossover in this room

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:04,000
how many of you have been both an IT

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,700
person and a developer person now look

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,380
at those hands and the people who didn't

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,890
put their hands up didn't because

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:16,700
they're too lazy to go like that

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:20,090
it's okay i'm the same way so since you

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:24,550
are all windows adepts with your comptia

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:27,860
windows a B plus C certificates I'm sure

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:31,160
the question is how much is Linux

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,600
knowledge worth in added salary for an

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,280
IT worker this is right there on the

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,550
slide and I know what it says because I

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,470
wrote those slides it depends and it

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,060
does it depends on where you are and

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,300
what kind of work you're doing for what

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,550
kind of employer or for yourself as a

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:52,430
consultant what kind of clientele which

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:56,270
is also location dependent then degrees

00:05:52,430 --> 00:06:01,220
and certifications they're good provable

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:03,740
experience is better and this is a new

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,440
thing within the last 10 years a much

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,170
more soon last three or four involvement

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,170
in an open source project is like the

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,660
gold standard for hiring when you're

00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:21,200
dealing with technical managers real

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:25,370
managers about operating systems read

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,030
that this is what a woman told me who is

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,760
an IBM z-series mainframe marketing

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,470
prison and this was back in the days and

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:40,040
people like me as I was young punk then

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,900
five years ago used to say are you

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,960
running linux on that computer you're

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,510
using to present at this linux

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,010
conference well no they were running

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,260
windows well I'm not one of the tech

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,540
people I'm a marketing person we did

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,310
that and she said to me obviously the

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,100
big companies i deal with have every

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,350
operating system there is running

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,920
somewhere in their operations she ran

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,770
linux on her collapse up and in fact was

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,750
a russian and had been a programmer for

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,240
years before she had gotten into

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:15,950
marketing she was pretty real and really

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,570
nice now I'm going to say something that

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,230
sounds like I'm just going away from

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,570
what I just said okay so we need to

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,770
realize that a big company and even a

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,919
small and often

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,750
every operating system there is within

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,599
their confines are all a major ones

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:38,419
anyway and the heart of IT you must to

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,389
be credible with an employer you must be

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:46,190
able to diagnose and repair basic

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,690
hardware problems it's that simple you

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,150
know that they come for you with their

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:56,360
broken computers your family your

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:58,490
co-workers yes I know me too it you know

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,319
I have the t-shirt the thing eat dessert

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,669
that says no i will not fix your

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,490
computer they cannot read it and i'm

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:09,440
going to tell you about somebody i will

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,259
not use a name if i do live in this

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,150
retirees trailer park and in a retiree

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,270
trailer park there are actually lots of

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,009
people with computers and the reason you

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,900
have computers is so that you can

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,710
exchange email with your children and

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:29,150
grandchildren up north and pictures and

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:33,800
for the more adventurous video chats yes

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:35,479
so a neighbor who i'll call sandy

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:41,169
because we're near the beach also her

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:44,480
name is sandy is she had a computer that

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,770
had a blue-screen sometimes it's

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,829
suddenly how did the screen was blue in

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:53,870
that stopped working okay and she said I

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:56,270
called will call him dick squid fix it

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,640
and they reinstalled windows and they

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,350
did this Annette and she turned it on

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,959
and she was chatting with her daughter

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,529
in Tennessee or wherever and it blue

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:10,010
screened again badness so the third

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:12,320
nation talks to my wife who is maybe not

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:16,190
a computer guru by the standards in this

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,010
room but by the standards of 55 plus

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,170
trailer park she's pretty hip unless

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,899
you're at Sun City where all the retired

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,880
IBM people live that's a whole different

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,370
order that by the way just so you know

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,620
that's the largest computer group users

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:35,360
group in the world is in Sun City

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,810
Florida outside of Ruskin which is where

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,750
all the carnival people go in the winter

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,630
you knew they had some place it's Ruskin

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:48,230
anyway so finally the computer ended up

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:53,089
in my office / workshop / video studio

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:55,970
on my bench i goota it up in at work and

00:09:53,089 --> 00:10:00,110
then it went blue and stop so I took the

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,000
CD you can see the CD it's the Linux one

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,690
actually DVD and I booted it from that

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,699
and it worked and it ran fine they said

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,310
sandy when we try it with this Linux

00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:12,290
program she had okay we'll just say yes

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,880
yes yes so you know she could do email

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:19,459
said yahoo was just browser and and and

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,130
you know i got her who have camped work

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:23,990
and that was it she was happy except for

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,660
one thing the thing blue screened again

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:30,709
except it didn't blue screen it just

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,959
stopped giving a picture she was puzzled

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,360
and upset because she needed her

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:40,100
computer cuz one of her daughters was

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,930
about to deliver a grandchild and right

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,720
after that she wants see you guys all

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,870
right fine so you know i looked at it

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,250
and I looked at it and finiteness oh oh

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:57,310
I opened it up I unplugged it I felt

00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:03,470
stuff and the video card was really hot

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:05,569
real hot okay it was a real fantasy

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:10,220
video card just was a computer that was

00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:12,860
given to her by a gamer child as a

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,230
surplus so how does huge humongous you

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,720
know like funny gigabyte now we're

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,640
probably one gigabyte video card so I

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,069
pulled it out I stuck in a junk when I

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,480
had and it the computer work forever and

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,310
ever is still it's probably working at

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,860
this very moment because she works

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,290
afternoons she'd be yackin with the

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,680
daughter right now it was a hardware

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,720
problem the geek squid people assumed it

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,670
was a software problem it was not a

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,490
software problem and there's also a

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,830
macbook

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,130
Pro under here that is mine i'm using

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,260
the house computer for the thing but my

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,899
macbook pro had a hardware problem and

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:58,459
it was repaired by Marty Connor who is a

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:58,459
Mac hardware and software guy for google

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:06,360
Marty would like to be a Mac admin you

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:10,110
can't be he is hired for his mac skills

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,779
and apple knowledge by google plus he

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,930
can do he's a master of some of the old

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:19,260
like this he's a list master which is

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,000
useful but you can't just be a Linux

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,209
system and what do you do have the

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,160
office people have windows and the

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,380
accounting people can make a very good

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,310
case that the software they need is

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,459
windows only they're right it is but you

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,440
can't just be a window system in either

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,850
because somewhere in that company you've

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,040
got all the major operating systems

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,620
right especially if it has even if it's

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,930
pretty small you got some artists who

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,029
are diehard Mac people you got those

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,610
accounting and sales people and they're

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:52,620
using windows only software and then you

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,450
have the servers and the stuff in back

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,149
into programmers and they have linux and

00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,589
unix and they're happy with it oh and if

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,680
you want to create us trying to steve

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,290
jobs which many people do we all love

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,010
steve jobs man who said you only need

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:12,329
one mouse button not a well I'm not

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:14,339
Steve Jobs I don't know but if you want

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,089
to create that shrine and say Apple

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,560
forever and probably made with a mac

00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:22,110
well first of all don't be the Worldwide

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,910
Church of Satan because Apple will ask

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,149
you to remove that and the think

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,070
different dads from your website I'm not

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,790
kidding they didn't they didn't want you

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:35,339
to think that different but anyway you

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,670
can be an apple mac enthusiast we love

00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:43,740
you don't put up all other operating

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:48,029
systems suck banners at work read that

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,770
the versatile sysadmin never sneers at

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:53,100
someone else's operating system

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,550
preference so if you are a big mac attic

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,370
you're probably not in this

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,860
because this is a Linux conference but

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,459
then you may have infiltrated I do not

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:11,430
know and you may have snow leopard on

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:11,430
that hackintosh I brought coffee

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:24,230
coffee and insulin are the two main

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:26,959
fuels of old people in Florida no we're

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,120
not shooting heroin we should sorry it's

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,740
insulin but anyway do not sneer at

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,079
someone else's operating system

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,910
preference ever they're wrong you're

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,959
right deal with it smile it's like

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:41,420
politics there's Lewbert Aryans and

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,279
Democrats and conservatives and liberals

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,930
I don't know in this from and I'm not

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,490
going to snare it any of you because I'm

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:52,790
right and you're all wrong so I don't

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:55,190
need to see this no ktulu changes his

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,040
favorite operating system at random

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:03,500
intervals this is why you do not sneer

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:06,529
today Cthulhu male of Macintosh so when

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,709
you like Macintosh the two who is your

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:14,120
friend if you people know who Cthulhu is

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:15,740
you'd better so you could thing is if

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,810
you treat one operating system better

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,779
than the others because of that random

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:24,339
change sooner or later you will anger

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:27,920
the old ones and if you anger an old one

00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:32,810
especially ktulu he will suck your soul

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,329
from your body that leaves a big mess on

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,579
the floor and your wife or husband

required to do it and she had killed

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:03,040
people but anyway she didn't use flesh

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,250
she didn't have a computer she was a

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,220

up to a point you cannot have flesh and

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:38,230
I went through a period when the only

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,270
operating system that you could really

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,360
from a foam get on the internet with and

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,360
see pictures was windows this was like

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,970
windows zero zero zero point one I had

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:53,440
das I like toss I was happy with das a

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:56,980
real crappy computer and no money the

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,840
time and I actually made a website for

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,300
my then limo business that's why the rob

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,460
limo Robin's limousine in the days of

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,640
eight character maximum screen names and

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,070
I had that I made a website I couldn't

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,280
see the pictures so and it's the library

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,920
to look at the pictures that was a lot

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,320
of time wasted wasn't it what if I just

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,090
had windows look Peter I had wouldn't

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,540
run at da da da and then somebody came

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:25,840
out with Arachne which was a semi okay

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,720
browser that would run in Doss and do

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,550
pictures and later on I found there was

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,240
that operating system something called

00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:35,280
loonocks tried that and

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,370
I failed I had trouble I couldn't get it

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,710
to run for my hero finally got some help

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,410
there was a linux users group president

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,420
was guiding Danny Pearson any other girl

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,430
was named Jeff kovy you remember when

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,870
you may be first try with linux and you

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,090
had so much trouble with it you went

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,590
down to a linux users group for help

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:58,500
with an installation yeah me too I I did

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:03,000
Jeff Co V is the chief editor for fresh

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,620
meat I hired him and dan pearson also

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,110
worked on fresh meat although right now

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,290
he's in the ID le israeli defense forces

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,060
IDF moved to israel because he needed to

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,680
get away from his mother if you'd met

00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:18,210
his mother you would understand this and

00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,620
israel was as far as he could get on

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,180
this planet and he couldn't get an

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,190
astronaut thing as far as he could get

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,870
on this planet and something so he could

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,140
wear a yarmulka and devin and the

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,910
synagogue so he's there his mother

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:35,810
unfortunately does go to visit him and

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:39,000
she is an overbearing person but anyway

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:41,370
mrs. Pearson aside there is no room for

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,800
operating system or software licensing

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,050

which is written by a college kid

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,760
because he was one man and Brian acres

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,250

00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,590
pretty well Brian made his stuff better

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:49,120
and as you may or may not have heard my

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:52,870
SQL sold the Sun and Sun wanted Brian's

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,220
contract to be abrogated and for him to

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,260
write whatever they said and he had a

00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:08,610
bunch of money from the thing and a

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:08,610
house in Seattle and he said no correct

00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:20,020
yes yeah well okay we can get after I'm

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:25,510
done speaking we can get into a date of

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:34,029
importance vs money and we can do Nikola

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:41,020
Tesla okay and who knows who first made

00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:46,960
a working television in the US what was

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:49,690
his name right Farnsworth name used by

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,450
Robert Heinlein a couple of stories as a

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,179
tribute he didn't make any money out of

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,100
it fairly important you know then we can

00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,070
get into the importance of television is

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,380
it important I don't know my father was

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,990
a big-time amateur radio operator and

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,110
I'm really sorry he said that someday

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,899
our neighborhoods would be defined by

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,820
interest not by geography I'm really

00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:14,710
sorry he didn't live to see the Internet

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,049
he would have loved the hell out of it

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,760
because it was everything he watered who

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:23,320
was also one of the socialist one word

00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,799
world or techno utopians that were

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,559
common in the 50s and 60s but back to

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,409
lenox you've heard about Lennox okay yes

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,140
linux skills are valuable in today's IT

00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,760
job market okay start and I'm reading my

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,120
own slide that I wrote I'm double

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,880
dipping think lots of people no windows

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:48,220
I have a granddaughter who knows windows

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,990
she helps her friend install and their

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,250
teenage girls and their purpose in

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:56,380
having computers is to chat on facebook

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,549
stuff like that we've got my

00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,860
granddaughter's 19

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:01,899
need your granddaughters we got them

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,840
some of those really you know like $89

00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:07,440
android netbooks we've saved ten dollars

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,720
by not getting the ones with the cameras

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,669
because all of the internet trouble i

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,789
have seen teenage girls get into

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:17,789
involves cameras don't give them cameras

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,789
I'm telling you this I'm a father I'm a

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,979
grandfather actually I'm a

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:27,720
great-grandfather which is scary because

00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:30,330
this is a granddaughter who got pregnant

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:35,820
at a horribly early age against

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:38,669
everybody's advice but anyway if these

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,009
girls know linux and they can go into a

00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,359
job interview say oh yes i know windows

00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:47,849
you don't know linux you can go inside

00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:50,609
no windows and linux so you're rare runs

00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:52,919
up your market value and then the big

00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:55,200
question which operating system windows

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,369
or linux runs more critical servers you

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:03,539
I know it's linux true I'm talking about

00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:05,190
big dogs here in Charlotte the Queen

00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,049
City where I still haven't seen a

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:11,820
transvestite why do they call it the

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:13,830
Queen City which believe me Bank of

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,700
America does not run their big servers

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:21,539
and Swift the transfer program this lot

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,909
runs on unix and linux not windows so

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,919
the big critical stuff where they pay

00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:29,129
the big salaries for you to sit and

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,169
snooze and dick away on slashdot now

00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:35,940
YouTube which is much more time wasting

00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:40,349
when you're doing that for big money the

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,859
windows only people are fixing desktop

00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:45,690
computers for a lot less money all right

00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,979
now let's talk about certification in

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,570
just a minute i'm going to call up

00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:50,759
somebody who knows more about it than I

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:54,259
do let's start you've heard of Red Hat

00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:57,929
right in North Carolina company I

00:24:54,259 --> 00:25:01,349
remember when Bob Young was selling red

00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:05,940
hat on CDs and baggies at a folding

00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:08,159
table I really do I met him back that he

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,950
joke said they had their first Linux

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,200
thing and I was the entire and I'm

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:18,090
talking about the entire press corps who

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,070
I was it and I was lonely then Steve on

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:23,609
Nichols joined in some places he in this

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:25,080
from Steve are you up Stephen anyway

00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,700
he's going to be the evening keynoter

00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,129
he's much smarter than I am better

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,160
educated but here we are in North

00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:33,910
Carolina

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:36,300
home of red hat and it is the gold

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,650
standard maybe even the red standard of

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,800
enterprise linux training and

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,760
certification there's no question of it

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:48,850
because red hat is the gold standard

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,130
distro for heavy enterprise use because

00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:54,850
all big enterprises it seems have some

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:57,250
proprietary software around they can

00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,910
only get on binaries and what

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:03,370
distribution are those fineries for red

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,310
hat so like it or not red hat is

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:10,150
dominant in that space and that means

00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,830
that Red Hat training and certification

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,570
is dominant and we'll get you the big

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:17,440
jobs the ones where you sit over at Bank

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:20,080
of America and snooze for money the

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,400
thing is Red Hat training and

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,760
certification are expensive so you do it

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,060
for your boss do it for the team take it

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,180
for the team you take red hat training

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:37,030
and go for red hat certification when

00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,170
your company is paying for it it is buku

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:47,230
bucks buku bucks a misused pseudo French

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:49,450
word and my brother and I learned it in

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:53,430
Thailand were they learned it from

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:56,250
Vietnam do not ask why we were there

00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:59,080
that we saved you from communism

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,640
woo-woo-woo see because none of you are

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,690
cotton well maybe some of you are I

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,669
don't know

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:08,340
but basically redhat certification is

00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:12,270
what you get when your boss is paying

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:14,480
for it okay Elfi I I like Elfie is a

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,100
non-profit it's all over the place if

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,860
certifications I respected and the

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,250
training and the testing is like low

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,919
cost because it's nonprofit as

00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:29,100
vendor-neutral it's not tied to anyone

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,960
just drove you know often their training

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,190
and tests are part of a linux conference

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,169
why there's a LPI person right there yes

00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,570
the guy looking for somebody behind him

00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,520
yeah you with the face that's an army

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,370
thing I want to volunteer it really

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,299
turns around my father said in the world

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,870
war two when they were just meeting

00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,940
outside he was in OCS at college Ohio

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,190
State and he said he was in uniform I

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,549
was apology stream ecology justice said

00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,380
our boys will lick them Huns my father

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:01,080
said he kept running around to see where

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,020
our boys were and then he was on a troop

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,840
transport going to North Africa all

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,140
right LPI though Ross on it might as

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,870
well come up here because last night I

00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,270
was thinking you know I can ask him

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:21,450
questions and then regurgitate them to

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:23,279
you or he can just join me and you know

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,360
straight from I'm the horse's ass you

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,309
get it straight from the horse's mouth

00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:31,279
see end and he's taller too and he's

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:37,740
wearing an Elfie I shirt which I am NOT

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:40,820
but the thing is an Elfie I certificate

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:45,529
will impress a human resources person

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:48,240
just as much as a red hat certificate or

00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:53,130
possibly a green hat certificate if you

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,010
had one is here is the dirty secret of

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,659
all IT certifications and see there's

00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,520
little words at the bottom that are hard

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:03,539
to read all the rest the words of my

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,750
slides are big and easy to read unlike

00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,399
some slides I see somewhere that I need

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:12,510
a little words because that's a dirty

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,040
secret the certifications really only

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:18,210
impress

00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,890
people and non-technical managers okay

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,960
we'll get into what impresses the real

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,430
people later let's start like talking

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,460
about I'm just gonna hand him like

00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:35,370
telling about LTI kitchen kitchen we

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:36,840

of you out there i was sitting in the

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:43,050
front row and it's like that's all right

00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,460
we're used to public speaking so Robin

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:49,170
Robin mentioned ktulu that's the

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,550
original HP Lovecraft that is tried to

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,500
catch him with coffee in his mouth it's

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:58,350
more more interesting that way when he

00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:00,510
turns into a fountain the server will

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,800
never be the same and the guy in the in

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:06,150

able to pass the LPI exams one thing you

00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,150
may not know and this is something that

00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,730

about certifications of Collins now they

00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,730
have lost value in the last few years

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:32,460
all of them is it not saying LPI sucks

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,399
is everybody i blame microsoft just

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,379
flat-out Microsoft ruins industry

00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,029
certifications have you seen those

00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,799
headlines where the eight-year-old boy

00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:43,799
became a certified Microsoft

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:48,259
professional there's been more than one

00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:52,019
set to see Microsoft is caught in a bind

00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:54,480
they portray windows as easy you don't

00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:59,419
have to hire expensive people like you

00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,950
guys to you know make the stuff work

00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:05,340
that's their pitch so it has to be easy

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,600
so the tests have to be easy to pass so

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,669
you have a lot of sent my qualified

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,350
people but you know I'm gonna tell you

00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:12,629
something I need some guys who had a

00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,610
little computer consulting business in

00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,559
Baltimore years ago and they they you

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,450
know they wired up the computers for

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,669
little businesses and stuff and put this

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,320
offer and they made a living they didn't

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:23,940
get rich but you know they could go to

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,789
go to the synagogue take care of their

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,379
children you know go on vacation every

00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:32,000
summer for you know they lived a nice

00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:34,259
middle-class life in pikesville and then

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,059
Microsoft put out the senior coming out

00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,039
with this windows thing there's going to

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,140
be so easy that you wouldn't need to

00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,730
hire professional outside help

00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,360
run it really that was their pitch

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,530
remember that so when these two guys and

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,690
they're scared they're going to lose

00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,790
their business goes to Microsoft's

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,860
introduction of windows thing in DC

00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:56,400
because that tells us partner don't

00:33:52,860 --> 00:34:01,260
worry we're safe and they're still in

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,940
business so yeah they were safe okay

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,550
here's another thing about open source I

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,530
want to think about here's a statement I

00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,970
worked on the MJ ultra bottom secret

00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,250
top-selling proprietary Lance

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,510
measurement and actuarial program it was

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,340
really hot stuff and it's very

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,050
successful in the marketplace and as

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,070
your interviewer i might say really can

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:23,700
you prove it you can't show me what code

00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:27,540
you wrote it's a black hole its

00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,520
proprietary software I've contributed

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,909
the linux kernel here's some of the code

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,550
I wrote see you can point to it's got

00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:39,510
your name on it true of many open so I

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:42,179
have leadership skills oh right you run

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,399
the blood project we can tell oh it's

00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,620
number four million three hundred young

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,470
sourceforge must be cool but it's you

00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:53,970
know useful popularity and utility are

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:57,390
not identical once again here's a big

00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:59,910
question it's going to happen this pc

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,500
wont boot please fix it that's the way i

00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,440
would test the hardware guy i don't know

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,330
about you yeah if it won't work if you

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,210
can't make the computers work we don't

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:11,100
need you really and that's true because

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,720
we all know that computer people know

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:18,270
everything about computers programmers

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,430
know how to make hardware I do strongly

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,190
recommend if you have never done it that

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,590
you assemble at least one or two pcs

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:29,130
from scratch yourself get one of those

00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:32,100
kits at newegg or if you live where I do

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,600
in Florida you can go still to UM

00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,410
circuit city which is Tiger same thing

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:43,880
and by the kitten they're cheap make one

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:46,110
it's good experience if you haven't and

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,350
now like I said premiums for

00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:51,210
certifications have been going down and

00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:53,200
that's something that again Ross is

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,060
better he follows us

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,800
I look at it from the outside and I

00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,260
write a column I read a column for tech

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,910
target their IT knowledge exchange it's

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,920
called climbing the IT career letter

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,860
it's pretty apropos about what I'm

00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,130
speaking about here today I quote these

00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:14,440
foot partners guys a lot because they're

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:16,390
real genuine don't care people now there

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,900
was a whole spate of stories like Linux

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,850
Foundation will run a services Oh linux

00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,530
jobs are great you should all learn

00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,620
about linux linux is taking over the

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:29,350
world next year the international space

00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:33,780
station will run on linux everything is

00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:37,810
Linux coming up linux all over yeah well

00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:41,230
microsoft says microsoft azure is going

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:44,740
to dominate the cloud server market no

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:46,240
it's not but they say it see everybody's

00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,830
got an ax to grind so you have to go to

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,050
somebody independent it's journalist

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,500
I've tended to be i am the independent

00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,180
guy i don't give a I just you know

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,950
go out and get the facts and I like

00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,440
tighten down if I have an opinion i

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,860
added on that's it I'm not getting paid

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,920
by hewlett-packard or man Viva remember

00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,720
them or anybody else I'm getting paid by

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,630
the publisher or I'm just writing for

00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,000
fun which I do sometimes okay so let's

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,410
look at foot partners if you're in a

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,990
position where you're hiring a lot of IT

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,820
people are hiring contractors you're

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,340
willing to pay thousands of dollars for

00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:24,370
their rather exhaustive research and

00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,770
it's worth it to yet if you're a common

00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:29,110
everyday bum which you probably are you

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,000
still can get a lot of their free stuff

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,320
and it'll give you a good idea of how

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,500
much salary you should get if you're

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,000
drastically underpaid look around if

00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,470
you're drastic man to pay because you're

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,230
working for a non-profit you love the

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:43,330
work stay you know that's why I say it

00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,550
depends on this sort of thing money

00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,440
isn't everything there are places I know

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,800
a guy who works for a public library

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,410
system in Maryland he gets paid fairly

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,910
little Phil Shapiro he writes on the

00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:59,470
side and he loves his job beyond belief

00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,180
it's something he's working that's

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:03,670
something he'd do for nothing in fact he

00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,270
started as a volunteer more money isn't

00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,890
going to take it

00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,230
way unless his wife has another kid

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:12,190
which is looking possible anyway foot

00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:16,120
partners is a truly independent source

00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:19,450
now a less independent source Ross how

00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:27,510
much is certification LPI certification

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:27,510

00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:17,670
remember excuse me political side of

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,220
thing very brief I believe in

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:22,110
traditional marriage biblical merits I'm

00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,030
a very bad Jew really he watched me eat

00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,420
sausage pork sausage for breakfast I'm

00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:29,730
in the South that abrogates but the

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,700
thing is traditional read your Bible

00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,490
people read it it says over and over

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:41,280
again a marriage is pretty much one man

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:44,370
and all of women he can grab it's true

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,410
that's traditional marriage romney's

00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:51,240
grandfather and great-grandfather were

00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:53,940
right this modern stupid liberal libtard

00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,150
crud of one man and one woman doesn't

00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:00,290
work we know that why is that because I

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,290
don't have enough direction in my life

00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:12,030
anyway be traditional where were we we

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:19,650
were fixing servers fixing some meat

00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:21,420
meanwhile back at the server farm server

00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,790
Dorland the server to server room door

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,320
locks yes so one of the things that I

00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,820
had the message I have for you is the

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,070
one that hiring managers talk to us

00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,290
about all the time we were kind of at

00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,270
the crux of where everybody says okay I

00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,980
want to get my certification okay get

00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,770
your certification then they say what

00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,230
the certification provide me how many of

00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,270
you have been a hiring manager okay

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,830
what's one of the things that you look

00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:47,220
for you look for qualified people right

00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:49,620
can you personally vet everybody on your

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,840
project used to be the hands would

00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,370
skyrocket up I had two or three people

00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,140
in there it's not a very big project no

00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,360
problem last project I did was an

00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,090
integration between two systems 19

00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,430
different sets of people okay nobody can

00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,260
fit that many people so the problem is

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,460
is if you can't vet them you have to

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,890
turn to an independent third-party

00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,520
metric that says they're at least this

00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:15,540
good not there this great but they at

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,780
least don't suck this much okay sorry

00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,100
it's true okay talk to HR people are

00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,450
they looking for rock stars and I

00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,170
looking for people to show up every day

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,089
and do something consistently

00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,770
many years ago and I was a child my

00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:28,510
father owned a machine shop called

00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,390
roland miller & associates guess his

00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,940
name and this was in Los Angeles that he

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,849
was a big Union believer he would hire

00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,530
only Union machinists because number one

00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,930
he didn't have to worry about health

00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,309
insurance or vacation funding that went

00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,809
through the Union they paid the little

00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,210
feet I wasn't done much and that was it

00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:48,670
but the big thing was he said when he

00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,220
hired a journeyman union machinist that

00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,440
guy would show up he'd be sober and gets

00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,390
throw him on a milling machine with a

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,970
blueprint and the guy could make it he

00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,980
knew he was buying you know he's paying

00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,960
a premium for a union guy but it wasn't

00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,290
a huge premium and a big thing was the

00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,020
guy was a certified he showed up he

00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:11,920
could work today and when you're on a

00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,900
tight defense contract you need that so

00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,740
the other thing is and this is a key one

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:20,190
is do you know how you get an interview

00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,809
what gets you the interview anybody know

00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:25,119
you sort if you're equal to everybody

00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,950
else they give you points for everything

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,089
okay HR people are very organized they

00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,250
put you in a big spreadsheet and

00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:32,170
everything equals points and if you have

00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,319
two certifications and somebody else who

00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,950
similar to you has one certification

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,540
you're probably going to get an

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,329
interview and maybe they won't or you

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,220
both get an interview the key is get the

00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:45,099
interview if you're standing around

00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,780
outside the candy shop of jobs looking

00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,119
in good god that looks really good but

00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,250
you know I don't do certifications and

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,869
I'm not going inside that store it's all

00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,569
right hungry is good but you know

00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:56,980
getting a job is better so if you're a

00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,839
hiring manager and you're trying to

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,640
figure out if people are good enough or

00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:03,309
they're qualified or whatever there's a

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,140
lot of historical value in

00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:06,730
certifications what was the joke you

00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,710
told me yesterday I can't remember which

00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:11,349
one it was Oh what do you call the out

00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,890
of a class of 400 in medical school what

00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:17,740
do you call the person who graduates 400

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,140
exactly oh great that's why we have

00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,780
minimum qualification standards okay

00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:25,059
that person is a doctor we salute the

00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:29,430
guy who graduated left in this class at

00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:32,579
West Point to or we have

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:36,510
yes you do first in our class at the

00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:39,780
intelligence school yes if you're if

00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:43,020
you're an e5 done speaking to a brand

00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,579
new second lieutenant the thing that you

00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,109
may think is I've been promoted four

00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:50,490
times more than you but that's not what

00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:51,900
you say ok now both he and I have had

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,369
this experience you've heard the things

00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,869
about you know the lieutenant with the

00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:56,309
map and gets lost and you have the

00:44:54,869 --> 00:45:00,480
sergeants II know where everything is

00:44:56,309 --> 00:45:02,940
yeah well we were both both of us at

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,190
different times were the guy who was

00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,890
never lost with the second lieutenant

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:09,720
who knew nothing of smart ones listen to

00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:13,230
us the dumb ones I don't know I only

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,730
really had one dumb one ever who ordered

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,859
me to do something I figured would kill

00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,960
my squad so we didn't do it it was a

00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:21,119
mutiny threaten me with court-martial we

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,369
went back and he was all fumed to the

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,050
battalion commander who called me over

00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:27,660
and I talked to him and out lieutenant

00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:30,089
disappeared I have no idea what happened

00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,430
to him he probably transferred him

00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:35,520
hopefully to some place he's the morale

00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,410
officer in Kamchatka right now well this

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,900
was a long time ago this was a long time

00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:42,599
ago back when sometimes officers who

00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,510
were Eirik a really stupid sort of died

00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:47,579
in the field the open source open source

00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,530
compliance officer somewhere yeah well

00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:51,960
now actually don't laugh my i have a

00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:54,000
friend John wethersby who's busily

00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,650
working to get open source into the

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,430
federal government and succeeding

00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:02,040
heavily there's an interview with him on

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:04,079
TV slashdot org that i did skype

00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,410
interview he's a good guy and he has a

00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:11,130
kel tec nine millimeter carbine so don't

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,900
mess with him I have a high point it's

00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,240
terrible guys talking about software

00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,799
both you live in the south so we talk

00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,119
about our guns and we show them to each

00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:23,160
other on skype you don't want to go but

00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:25,049
but really what is a certification worth

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,540
see we can't put an exact value on it

00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:32,270
depends on day of the week in what city

00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,270
and country urea so some of you know

00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:40,460
as I stand like this he's looking for

00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,770
the other team not sex right yeah it

00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,210
should put mirrors behind these so so

00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:46,220
the thing is come see us in the booth

00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,280
right we do these at all the shows we do

00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,110
the exam cram lab which is basically you

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,910
guys were at it yesterday we go after

00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,650
give you all the information that we can

00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,080
about the exams and you get a chance to

00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:59,990
go take the exams on Sunday at half

00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,360
price so go try one that's the key thing

00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,640
and the other thing is is that go and

00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,990
talk to your hiring managers go talk to

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,460
other people about certification and see

00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:12,110
what it's worth so basically when rough

00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,820
rob has a pretty good show but the thing

00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,620
is is that when you're in open source

00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,030
and you're a professional you need to

00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,760
help everybody else advance the cause

00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,930
right we all work together and the way

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,640
that we work together is to make sure

00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,410
that open source has the most

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,540
professional front that it can that

00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:28,460
doesn't mean you wear a suit and tie

00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:31,190
that means your professional sorry did I

00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,800
look over this know many years ago and I

00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:37,310
worked i'll just say now thank you ross

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:43,070
we love you he'll be at the booth go

00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:46,580
talk to them both for yourself and for

00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:47,840
your employer's if you are in or know if

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:51,770
you're on the hiring side of it it's

00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,540
it's good stuff and if you were to go as

00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:56,000
a contractor let's say you have a

00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,650
company and you're going after contract

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,140
you say oh yeah well all of our people

00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:06,100
are have LPI clinic certifications

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:08,330
really that sounds good where do I sign

00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,640
because you know you're dealing pretty

00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:13,100
much with people at some point you make

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,500
the financial decisions who are not

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,170
technically hip it's just the way it is

00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:21,440
their army officers you know they sent

00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:23,870
in the office and they have enlisted

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,060
people to do the work but you've got to

00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:28,880
get them to sign off that's why there's

00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,640
this big butt here even though we're not

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,650
going to training is valuable see I'll

00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,290
laugh out of it will laugh but training

00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,760
is valuable for your degree for your

00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:39,790
degree is still the best ticket to a

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,810
good job yes i know they cost too much

00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,239
everybody's in debt in the country is

00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:46,159
going to collapse don't worry about it

00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,169
we're going to inflate our way out of

00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,869
the debt problem it's the way it's done

00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:54,069
I don't care whether your name is Romney

00:48:50,869 --> 00:49:00,289
Paul or Clinton or whomever that

00:48:54,069 --> 00:49:02,599
President Clinton and 2014 2015 20 18

00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:04,279
we'll start inflate the inflation will

00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:05,809
not admit it but the value of the

00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:07,879
dollars already do it's it's the way

00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:10,749
it's done it's okay don't worry about it

00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:13,789
it's been happening since earth and zoo

00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:16,009
form the first intertribal Union first

00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:19,399
government say get a four year degree

00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:22,869
get it in an appropriate field you know

00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:25,369
a technical field we can earn some money

00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:28,189
second well-regarded industry

00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:30,739
certifications can help get a job or

00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:34,279
promotion because again what is it worth

00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:37,159
it can be worth job versus no job which

00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:40,039
can be a considerable amount and here's

00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:42,559
where the butt comes in the monster oval

00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,959
skill is a vest ticket to work that

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,929
there is can I give you the broken

00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:51,559
computer and you make it fixed you're

00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:53,629
hard well here's some stuff about some

00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:55,399
good words if you've already got Linux

00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:57,529
skills and experience you're in a good

00:49:55,399 --> 00:50:00,049
position for landing a Linux job or

00:49:57,529 --> 00:50:03,949
upgrading to a better one this is in pc

00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:05,269
world in April early May Linux

00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:07,669
professionals have reason to be

00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:10,339
optimistic about the future as Linux is

00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:12,499
being considered a priority skill this

00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:13,789
year companies are on a major lookout

00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:15,949
for development and systems

00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:19,009
administration skills this was written

00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:21,349
by Shailaja from a new knee for linux

00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:26,269
for you anybody here subscribes Linux

00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:28,719
for you right and you say you know my

00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:31,309
egg Sharma is the editor right my buddy

00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,589
for many years I've been stated his

00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:36,979
house I want him to come visit me but

00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:39,079
it's an Indian publication India they're

00:50:36,979 --> 00:50:40,849
really fertile Linux administrators if

00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,269
you want to move drive on the wrong side

00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:46,929
of the road eat spicy food be careful

00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:49,549
about I've seen people there wash

00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:51,979
vegetables grow the restaurant just

00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:53,689
below the sewer out flow in the river be

00:50:51,979 --> 00:50:55,559
real careful but it's a cool and

00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:58,489
interesting country different

00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:01,890
and they need linux's admin's and

00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:03,660
general FIFA is instructive probably if

00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:05,699
you're good so you can get paid I've

00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,369
actually been offered Zod's editing jobs

00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:11,400
and such in India for fairly substantial

00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:13,949
salaries I mean substantial by American

00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,309
standards which is insane by Indian

00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:23,029
Standards you can live like you come

00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:25,289
here kind of life you know yes Raja Oh

00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:28,229
Intel those legs you've heard of Intel

00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:30,660
anybody here heard of info yeah I

00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:34,920
thought so kind of like AMD but bigger

00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:38,160
and they're on a big push with this

00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,319
parallel studio and hpc and multi-core

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:44,999
this is a very big deal for them because

00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:47,849
it's big profit for them and like in

00:51:44,999 --> 00:51:51,630
April for today from yeah they had a big

00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:53,549
conference in Istanbul in Turkey of a

00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,249
high performance and multi-core

00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:58,529
computing and he had a whole lot of

00:51:55,249 --> 00:52:00,869
videos that they made of the engineers

00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:03,569
who spoke there I added those videos

00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:06,119
they're on a sourceforge site called go

00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:08,239
parallel which is Intel fade it's all

00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,709
Intel's great believe me on that site

00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:11,789
but the thing is it's kind of like you'd

00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:14,400
listen these guys near talking about

00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:16,559
well you know this is developing for

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,599
high performance multi Korea 16 quick

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,910
Lennox Lennox Lennox one windows linux

00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:23,369
linux England and and more and we work

00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:25,229
with linux windows and linux linux linux

00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:27,890
and it was like linux linux linux linux

00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:30,569
windows windows linux linux linux

00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,849
windows is sort of like oh yah for the

00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:34,499
office people maybe and these are guys

00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:39,119
who give their presentations they use

00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:41,699
souza they're Germans and they mean it

00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,999
if you're going to be a developer at or

00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:48,449
for Intel in this stuff you're going to

00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:52,140
develop on and for linux primarily these

00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:53,910
files are not paid poorly the ones I'm

00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,829
talking about there were Germans and

00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,559
Turks I do not know about living in

00:52:55,829 --> 00:53:00,719
Turkey I grew up in Southern California

00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:03,689
with lots of Armenians not just

00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:07,979
Cardassians we had lots of cute girls

00:53:03,689 --> 00:53:08,900
with black hair and long names around

00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:11,340
and

00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:15,030
their parents taught us that Turks are

00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:17,250
evil I'm not going to go there we're not

00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,690
in California but now I'm going to tell

00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,120
you the real secret of the whole thing

00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:26,760
do you want to be a healthy happy

00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:28,200
prosperous fulfilled person I'm ending

00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,940
see he's holding up the five-minute

00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:39,990
thing just when I'm getting ready to

00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:42,690
close isn't that amazing clock business

00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,950
bidness you don't work in a vacuum I

00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,360
don't know where you work I don't know

00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,150
what kind of work you do but it's not in

00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:51,270
a vacuum you don't have computers just

00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:54,090
to say I have a computer nobody uses

00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,440
Salesforce to say I use Salesforce these

00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:58,170
sales first because they're trying to

00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,560
sell stuff and it helps them they use

00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:04,530
this in that software because it helps

00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:07,350
them do something else produce car parts

00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:10,100
warehouse and ship the car parts I know

00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:13,470
a guy who's assisted min for a fish farm

00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:16,830
don't laugh it's huge they supply all

00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:20,070
your aquarium supplies for Walmart it's

00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:23,790
insane and their inventory grows if you

00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:27,780
input food and so what is their

00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:29,220
inventory it's really it changes so it's

00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,620
a big they had a write their own

00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,330
software because there's nothing out

00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:37,620
there that really works is some stuff

00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:40,320
for livestock does the same thing learn

00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:45,720
the business anybody here know anything

00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:48,600
about bookkeeping yeah some that's a

00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,310
very basic business function it's like

00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,930
member spreadsheets that was the first

00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:54,390
thing that computers were really used

00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:56,730
for in business go to the junior college

00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:59,130
it's not extensive take a bookkeeping

00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,650
course you'll find it easy because

00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:04,290
you've I definition know the math you'll

00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,300
find a math easy so you won't struggle

00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:09,660
with it but you'll learn the terminology

00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:14,010
and what they do and how they use those

00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:15,810
numbers that you help them process take

00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,820
business courses learn about marketing a

00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,770
marketing course anything you don't have

00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:22,400
to think them all at once or all of them

00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:26,190
learn the business functions for which

00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:29,760
your computers are being used for which

00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:32,550
you are writing the software read what i

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,500
said here is this is a great slider guy

00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:36,660
who wrote this must be well I wrote

00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,580
knowledge of the business aspects of

00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:42,270
your company plus strong technical

00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:44,880
skills equal career gold and happiness

00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,560
and we like that and that's all I'm

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,900
going to say because there is no better

00:55:46,560 --> 00:56:00,600
word to end this kind of presentation

00:55:48,900 --> 00:56:02,660
with no better word than happiness I'll

00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,800
be around out here with a video camera

00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:08,130
interviewing people for a slashdot

00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,190
videos today and tomorrow in general so

00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:13,730
ground me up I'll be the guy with the

00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,730
you know what I look like

00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:48,359
you

00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,660
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:58,609
ago we could not have imagined that

00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,800
asterisk would not only become the most

00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:02,960
widely adopted open source communication

00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,970
software on the planet but that it would

00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,490
impact the entire industry in the way

00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,470
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:12,109
way into more than 170 countries and

00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:14,060
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:16,160
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,570
transition of power from the hands of

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,849
the traditional proprietary phone

00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:22,220
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:24,170
administrators of phone systems using

00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,400
this power our customers have created

00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:27,349
all sorts of business changing

00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,210
applications from small office phone

00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:31,700
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:33,320
the international carrier networks in

00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,090
fact there's even an entire country

00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,700
those communications infrastructure runs

00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:39,619
on esters the gym has always been about

00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,330
creating technology that expands

00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:43,520
communications capabilities in ways that

00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:44,690
we could never have imagined and that's

00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,090
part of what's game-changing about

00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:49,790
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:51,890
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,990
IP phones that extends control of the

00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:55,760
user all the way to the desktop the

00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:57,470
launch of these new products represents

00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,570
the next phase indigenous history of

00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:01,970
innovation these are the first and only

00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,680
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,240
power of esters when we first discussed

00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,280
our expectations for building a family

00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,410
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,150
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,800
the team to build the phones such that

00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,990
they were easy to install integrate

00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,849
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:19,400
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:21,020
that goal user feedback is validating

00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,150
that when it comes to operation with

00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:25,580
Astra space systems including our own

00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:28,130
Switchvox based product these are the

00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,450
easiest to use best integrated most

00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,030
interoperable products on the market

00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:34,030
today the digitally phones will

00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:36,080
initially include three IP des hommes

00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:38,030
uniquely designed to complement any

00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,890
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,560
these phones are different for a number

00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:45,230
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,640
designed for use with esters secondly

00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,099
we've made it really easy to

00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,660
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:52,339
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,050
to access information inside of

00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:55,240
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,060
between an application

00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,040
and the phone additionally we've created

00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,230
an applications engineer that allows

00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,140
users and developers to create and run

00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:07,210
their own apps on the phone and finally

00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:09,250
we've done all of this at a very

00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,960
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,730
always thinking of ways to give our

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,100
customers the best value in business

00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,990
phone systems and also give them the

00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,150
power to create their own solutions or

00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:21,010
any communications challenge well

00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:22,720
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:24,760
to make astros cooler bastard more

00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,380
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,840
asterisk employed communications even

00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:32,310
easier and together we'll change the way

00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,310
the world communication again

00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:50,440
prospects I every way this is the way to

00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:52,360
better utilize all your resources and it

00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,420
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:59:52,360 --> 01:00:00,280
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:03,640
in open source the collaborative nature

01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:06,310
and of the you know of the community and

01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,200
the speed at which these are these you

01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:10,300
know these these deficiencies these bugs

01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,640
are getting discovered and then fixed is

01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:15,880
it I think that really shows the power

01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,890
of the of the open source community it

01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:22,120
is global and it's definitely because of

01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:28,420
the users community people are extremely

01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:30,190
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,780
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,760
these guys helping each other out and

01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:36,640
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,470
manner the product is transparent for

01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:42,670
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:44,710
base everyone can see how CloudStack is

01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:50,560
being built nothing nothing is

01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:53,230
proprietary everything is open in many

01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:57,400
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:00:53,230 --> 01:01:01,180
unborn health plan stack the most

01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:05,090
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:07,730
was our first developer boot camp

01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:10,370
and our call gave people at maybe two

01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:14,330
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:18,590
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:21,350
with 87 people and had to go get board

01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:23,870
chairs in the room twice everything

01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:27,230
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:30,200
is open source and so I don't think that

01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:31,970
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,000
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:37,700
computing and so i think it's i think

01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,050
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,190
about cloud computing you're really

01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:45,740
talking about open source cloud

01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:48,770
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,900
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:55,160
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:57,830
in each data center is these hardware is

01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:01,340
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:04,040
to handle number one that mass scale

01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:07,220
number two it's designed to handle the

01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:09,770
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:14,270
deployments we started working on pod

01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:17,570
tech over four years ago and it was the

01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:19,310
original set of people working on it had

01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:23,420
a background of delivering software

01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:27,650
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:31,280
lots of users actually using it high

01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:34,370
availability is a key feature multiple

01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,380
hypervisors support different network

01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:39,050
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:41,300
you better while step management server

01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:45,020
can be deployed in different physical

01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:46,670
machines it definitely has a huge

01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:51,680
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:54,230
there's a major movie studio that they

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,530
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:59,510
to transcode video and i thought that

01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:01,160
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:04,430
more fascinating is what they did during

01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:07,220
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:08,570
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:10,190
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:14,330
the instances and go back

01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:15,950
we'll work cloudstack is vast it touches

01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:18,050
so many different aspects and there's no

01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:20,420
one person that's kind of like a master

01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:24,530
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:26,840
as a project is going to be one of the

01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:30,830
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:36,260
most feature fallen and and robust

01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:39,160
platforms out favor I don't senior

01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,160
