00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:44,879
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:46,950
possible survey the surveys are

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,860
available at the registration desk if

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,829
you can fill one out and put it into the

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,320
survey box before the keynote starts

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:57,390
tonight then you mean the raffle there

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,670
is a Saturday raffle and there is a

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,010
Sunday raffle there is a different

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,780
survey for the Saturday raffle and a new

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,820
one tomorrow for the sunday raffle they

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,950
say Saturday and they say sunday on the

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,530
top so if you want to enter the sunday

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,140
raffle same thing tomorrow pick up a

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,960
survey form and quick to the box and

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,310
they'll draw that tomorrow now we'll

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,740
start with Brian Smith he's going to

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,900
introduce the key box and your honor how

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,900
you guys doing today so I'm going to

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,110
pass this guy round I hope to get it

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,110
back

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:54,310
so you know just you know take a look at

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:56,710
them and uh you know let them sit down

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,990
here my name is brian smith and i'm here

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,500
to talk about the cubox it's a really

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,510
nice device first one let you know I'm

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,310
not a solid run employee solid run is

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,640
the company who produces the cubox

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,709
they're out of Israel and one of the

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,220
actually the CTO of the company he's a

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:17,260
really big linux kernel developer and

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,520
they are pretty much a class act as you

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,890
can tell by the hardware when it comes

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,170
around and i'll talk quite a bit about

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,200
it so what i'm going to tell you about

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,240
pros and cons and you know tips and

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,709
tricks and what not is going to be like

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,750
real information i'm not pitching

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,700
anything i'm not selling those you know

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,830
as i said i want to get that up that was

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,110
back that's going around the room and so

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,550
you know it's not that I'm trying to be

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,440
dissing genuine everything I'm going to

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,100
tell you is from my personal experience

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,709
I'm not a Salesman so what is the cubox

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,370
are you guys all embedded developers

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:54,550
anybody new to embed it please wear your

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,580
hand on it and so who all it does

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,110
anybody have a cue box in here currently

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,110
of course you got a cute wiser man

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,290
okay so Q box as far as embedded Linux

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,650
goals it's uh it's an SOC design which

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,930
is called a system-on-chip it is very

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,700
nice low footprint low power that's not

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,490
the cubox with it's a puppy in the box

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,270
the whole thing is what is it bucks that

00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:29,300
makes it so spectacular you can see it's

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,000
a it's a it's roughly two by two by two

00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,820
it's actually smaller than then a two

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,650
inches cubed and packed inside of there

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,130
you have at least four different

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,239
processing units it can crank out it can

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,450
cook through very very high quality

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,480
medium and this is the only device that

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,470
you'll get where you have a panda board

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,690
it's a beagle bone none of those devices

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,850
come with a power adapter it's the only

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,489
one that currently comes with a power

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,560
adapter and comes in a case nothing else

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:06,590
does so it's it's it is a developer

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,650
device it's not for production it's not

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,120
an end product even though as

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,920
enthusiasts we use it you use it as an

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,450
in product but it is pretty much ready

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,030
to go out of the box it's got an SD card

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,620
in it it's populated with an operating

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:24,110
system and I'll talk a little bit about

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:27,169
that and so that is a clip of quake

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,880
three running on the cubox I I try to

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,620
get it on that projector we'll see what

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,919
we can do but it won't look like that

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,070
and so that is total you know running

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,540
you know the visualizations that you

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,190
know play when you play music I'm

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,600
playing reggae right there so it's kind

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:48,620
of funky but it's doing all of that with

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,200
acceleration it's and so the thing about

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,090
the cubox is that it's only a hundred

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,460
makers processor but in orem standards

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,660
that is very fast with everything else

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,300
that is on it okay so the question we

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,800
had was what is dual issues imma jump

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,410
right in this so if any you guys have

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,990
any questions just kick right in and

00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:12,370
I'll incorporate it into the tone so

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,190
that is a prime example a dual issue is

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,380
so

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,970
rule issue processor or dual dual issue

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,670
instruction that gives you double

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,140
instructions at the same time so

00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:25,350
basically it's like carrying a brick if

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,660
you carry one brick so as the workload

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,840
comes you can parallel eyes when you

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,310
have dual well when it's dual you can

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,860
paralyze so you can carry two Brits

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,310
instead of one so a processor that is

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,560
only single issue at the same speed can

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,020
only do half the throughput of half the

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,910
instructions that the clock data do is

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:53,490
you can so it is it does quite a bit at

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:57,930
that 800 megahertz it's got a USB jtag I

00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:02,250
think something is missing said again

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:05,490
please no no you can you can you can

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,980
actually see the question was is it's

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,830
just USB serial it's it's cereal and

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:15,030
it's unbreakable Scott the ftdi chip and

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:24,450
you can actually write you boot to spi

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:28,740
flash over that TTYL us be 0 yeah so

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,860
yeah it's a one gigabyte of one 1

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,860
gigahertz of a ddr ram running at one

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,610
gigabyte i'm sorry ddr3 RAM running 800

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:42,810
megahertz that micro USB is what will

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,700
give you that USB jtag so you've got the

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,450
hdmi that will give you display but if

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,640
you want boot boot loader access so you

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,620
can interrupt it it may be type some

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,070
commands in or you know some parameters

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,390
you will hook up the mini USB it's kind

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,370
of dark but that little guy right there

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,690
and then you know you'll see well that's

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,950
the wrong picture but you'll see

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,130
something like that show up in your d

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,020
msg you'll get this TTYL USB device and

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,560
then you can run putty you can run

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,140
mini-com you know any terminal program

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,730
and then access you'll get a prompt you

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:23,100
know you'll get your root login or

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:25,800
whatnot right next to that right above

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,500
it is a specific connector and if you

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,660
guys know speed if is this

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,690
for like yes this work for digital audio

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,110
and it's pretty much a optical and so

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:39,140
that's what that guy's right there and

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,690
it's got esata so if you look at all the

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,080
other devices out there trim slice

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,450
pandaboard beagleboard beaglebone no

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,000
device except for the Shiva plug which

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:53,360
is this is a marvel product so all the

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,930
Marvel products have gigabit ethernet

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,630
and access to esata nothing has access

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,550
to esata no no other devices so that's

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:06,770
what makes this little guy who's got it

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:09,200
right now but that's what makes it very

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,640
unique because the throughput that you

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:18,080
can get over esata versus going over USB

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,590
right now SDXC all at a time and just

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,260
going over network that maybe a hundred

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:29,120
megabit versus if this one being a gig

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,980
one gigabit and there is where the the

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,229
esata connector is right at the bottom

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,580
you know if you don't have it or until

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:39,140
it gets to you you'll be able to see

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:42,710
that gigabit ethernet that's a big deal

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,640
it supports jumbo frames you know so the

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,760
MTU on this guy is not 1,500 you set it

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,070
to 9000 you got your gigabit router and

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,380
you can do some serious throughput on it

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,810
you know so like I transfer today I

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:03,130
think it was like a 4.6 gig plus movie

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,660
that you know i got from somewhere and

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,240
so I transferred it and it took it took

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,280
four minutes and 6 seconds you know I

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,650
mean it you know it is a big deal

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:17,480
especially when you want to do streaming

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:19,550
of HD 1080p quality stuff you know it's

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,160
you can do it you can do it over Wi-Fi

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,430
because of acceleration on this but if

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,560
you're doing something like DLNA for

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,750
like some sort of PlayStation media

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,420
center trying to string to another

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:37,040
device you need that gigabit ethernet

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,170
connectivity you really do and there she

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,160
is right there your support that is a

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,810
big deal

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,889
it's a really big deal half Gigabit

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:51,899
Ethernet on SOC I mean that is an eSATA

00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:57,540
that is a big deal micro SDXC which that

00:09:51,899 --> 00:10:00,209
supports up to a 64 gigabyte flash media

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,509
but I wouldn't do that there's no

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:07,410
there's no reason to use the 64 gigabyte

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:09,839
flash card in anything like this because

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,850
I don't know if you guys know that most

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,420
flash media has a finite number of

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,000
rights now theoretically it's a hundred

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,829
thousand rights which you never know

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,060
because their secret sauce going on you

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,949
don't you don't know the we're leveling

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,730
so any flash media that you have whether

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:30,540
it be a USB flash whether it be a micro

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,490
SD all of them actually have a limit and

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,170
then once you reach that certain number

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,970
right cycles you can't write to it

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,620
anymore you can read but you can't write

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,029
so for instance you're running an

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,009
operating system off of this thing and

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,779
you running a journaling file system so

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:44,639
that increases the rights some people

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,939
may be crazy enough to run a database on

00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,360
it and that'll you will you will destroy

00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:53,579
up destroyed SD cards in like three days

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,199
just doing normal stuff you know not not

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,620
doing I you know I wasn't running like

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:01,470
postgres on or anything but you really

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,110
need to be using a block device to boot

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,750
from and the store all your files you

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,959
can mess around and just maybe boot the

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,399
colonel from it if you want to but you

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,740
know just go what he said if you get one

00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,480
of these devices that's where you that's

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,290
where you want to go if not worse case

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,630
get a external hard drive you know and

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:28,019
then a gold USB 2.0 and it boot from

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:32,819
that so there's the hdmi the micro SD

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:34,350
guy drink at this point a lot of layers

00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,410
i don't work is right down underneath

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,829
the hdmi another two USB ports nothing

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,379
special in the USB you just works now

00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:47,569
there's a whole bunch of other things

00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:50,790
that it has in it so the hdmi port is a

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:52,829
1.4 a port and it has CEC which is I

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,899
think it's a consumer electronic

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:58,610
connection where

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:00,480
cec will allow you to connect to say

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,619
various other devices and they can

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,749
communicate with each other and so you

00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:07,079
should be able to use one remote control

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:12,959
to control all of the devices so when

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:15,449
you hook up your Q box to your TV when

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,829
you press power to shut down on your Q

00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:18,869
box or the shutdown and TV then the

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:20,970
cubox will say okay shut down the other

00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,819
advice to shut down this other device in

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,499
the chain so to speak and as I said you

00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:29,610
should be able to use one remote control

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:33,240
with cec to use to control various

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:36,779
devices all connected through HDMI the

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,079
of Avantia GC 600 is the GPU that does

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,999
the 2d and 3d acceleration and it has

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,910
direct frame buffer acceleration which

00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:49,619
means that you don't even need X to do

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,769
acceleration so you know if that is a

00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:56,399
that in itself is a major major major

00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:58,649
deal but if audio port it can do 192

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,399
kilohertz out that's like very high

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:04,350
quality in 96 in that is super high

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,660
quality and that's optical so anything

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,629
that you do as far as a you know as I

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,970
said if you have some questionable MKV

00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:14,189
file that I guess let's say that you

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,350
back up your own blu-rays you can play

00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:18,569
it and then play it until your your

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,279
sound system and everything will be

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:24,120
phased correctly you'll get your

00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:27,600
whatever don't be going and it'll work

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,170
great and for rare receiver is another

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,740
big deal so to have an infrared receiver

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,959
on a box that is purposed the use case

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,660
primarily for that is a set-top box is

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,809
for media server things such as that so

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,059
to have it built in and you know all you

00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,490
need to do is install the package that

00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,059
that pretty much manages it and that's

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,749
it no no drivers needed it just works

00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:54,059
hopefully I'll be able to show you that

00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,920
and a face the engine right there

00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,689
cryptographic into the security

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,779
accelerator what that'll do is if you

00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:03,689
let's just say you have an eSATA device

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,579
hooked up and you want it encrypted so

00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:08,460
the big thing about this acceleration

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:12,230
that's how you get the 1080p video

00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:15,270
and that a 3d all this acceleration is

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:20,130
offloading it from a CPU so whenever you

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:24,300
want to create any sort of ssh a ssh

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,760
AORs aes any anything that that requires

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,280
encryption it will offload it to the to

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,560
the to the sasa engine and then it'll

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,910
speed it'll be much faster than if it

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,860
will try and do it in processor so if

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,060
you have an encrypted drive your rights

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,530
and your reads are going to be much

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,900
faster than if you didn't have that

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,840
section engine because this is actually

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:47,130
happening in hardware and it's not using

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:51,720
just clock cycles bless you too two

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:55,590
processes and so there is a the actual

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,150
infrared you know window for the son of

00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:02,040
Bacchus I think I think that side is

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:04,290
facing you on the on the device so the

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,980
boot methods for this guy as I said

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,920
before we got a seder you can boot you

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,410
can mount your route from NFS you can

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,740
boot from USB and you can boot from

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:20,130
micro SD and all of that is right there

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,780
in that little small form factor so you

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:26,870
know that's pretty much straight forward

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:28,830
in that regard practical applications as

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,900
I mentioned before you know

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,470
automatically just because of gigabit

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:38,760
ethernet and the size no pot no fans

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:41,490
it's a the form factor you know lends it

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,370
to just being any sort of server now the

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,730
i/o I mean you're not you can run apache

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,430
on it you can run light httpd on it you

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,080
can run a number of daimons on it

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:58,020
simultaneously and you really never

00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:02,580
notice the load on this on a system but

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:06,510
um as far as like as a desktop system

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,270
you can run that by itself and you know

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:13,020
for fedele computing there are some

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:16,620
other things that q box and solid run

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,830
and marvel have offered that no other

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,980
platform have

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:23,710
available so why you gives us desktop so

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,600
most people want to use Arm for desktop

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,510
but what is the biggest thing that you

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:33,310
think you're lacking from arm on the

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:34,750
desktop anybody know anybody so whatever

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,270
the most people do when they get on the

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:45,640
internet what's like sitting go to flash

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:49,900
flash there you go so to be able to use

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,490
that Joker as a desktop PC you got to be

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,920
able to go to youtube you know people

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,870
live on YouTube you know I mean it's

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,940
just got to happen right and some other

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,430
you know sites that people use but I'll

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,560
tell you all about how you can do flash

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,830
on it it's no other platform has it

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,930
currently and so I'm just that's just

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,540
there I'm not going to read it that

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:14,140
stuff actually but but that's the actual

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,600
that is if this is the Armada 5 10 it's

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,870
a nonminor 5 10 base unit so all of this

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:24,010
stuff is what is capable on the die on

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:28,030
the chip now you're not like you're not

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:30,550
going to see this tws I to uh to our

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,770
serial interface you know a lot of stuff

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,430
is not actually populated on the board

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,380
but the processor itself can do it now

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,450
what is available is which is a big deal

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,550
that right in the middle of that DMA

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,350
right next to the cryptographic engine

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:50,490
and security accelerator that DMA ands

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:53,200
or engine that is basically bit for bit

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,180
redundancy that is primarily using ray

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,760
devices so whenever you do writes and

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,330
reads it's going through zuhr engines

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,360
and so it is it's optimizing it it's

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,990
very it's very optimized that a V meta

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,060
HD video decoder that is what's you know

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,750
kicking in and allowing you to do that

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,280
1080p stream at 720p or 1080i or

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:19,090
whatever the stream that you have

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,590
without a frail and so this is what's

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,820
actually there from from that to this

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,220
you know so this is kind of like the pie

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,470
in the sky but it's there it's it's it

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,900
could be there but it's not populated so

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,710
these are things that you actually

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:40,290
have access to and I didn't make that

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:42,450
slot II that it's kind of ugly but so so

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,270
you know like I already talked about to

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,610
dip the micro USB you know it's all

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,240
pretty much straightforward right there

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:54,360
to WM MX so if if you if any if you guys

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,330
know much about like you know embedded

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,700
in instruction sets so this doesn't do

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,880
me on so certain applications like like

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,740
VLC media player does neon so if you

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,390
want to play your your video with VLC

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,080
this ain't the device to do it on now

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,090
totem through gstreamer that wmm x is an

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,810
instruction set that allows that allows

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,850
you to be able to utilize the

00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:24,870
acceleration from the device so there's

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:27,600
this big list of programs that that do

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,280
that they do it through gstreamer and so

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:44,220
you just use that instead of using VLC

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:46,290
and okay and and it'll work so so the

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,300
question was as i said i mentioned flash

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,910
and we're in terms of adobe flash but

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,180
does it have any internal memory so man

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,230
wise it's not as if you have you have

00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:01,110
memory for bootloader that's it it's

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,870
pretty much it stores it stores a you

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,300
boot and that's it you know and and then

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,890
you but you gots 2 1 gig of so if you

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,930
want to you can boot it and amount of

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,050
ram disk and use part of that you know

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:18,960
if you want to and it will be super fast

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:20,340
you know when you have that sector is i

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:49,700
can't remember exactly how

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:49,700
yes that's a good yeah

00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:08,859
yeah but this guy it's not enough space

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,950
to put the corner to just you boo yeah

00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:13,769
it in space for that but uh he's right

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,219
though he knows what he's talking about

00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:21,099
yeah yeah he is yeah so these are also

00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:24,549
there are and this is not an exhaustive

00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:27,190
list of distros and OSS that you can run

00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,629
on a cue box you know i'm a debian guy

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,940
so i put dipping at the top of the list

00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:33,779
i'm a debian guy so i put debian at the

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:40,659
top of the other list too so you know

00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:42,159
but what I so you know boo too so now

00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:46,149
the funny thing with the Bootle is uh

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,849
you know boo too and Lennar oh they put

00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:52,869
a lot of money in embedded development

00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:55,029
so boots who is really the way to go and

00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:59,139
that's actually what comes on a device

00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:08,769
but it's not fair it's not fair but

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:11,440
that's just they got the money well so

00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:13,749
soaked unix heat the question is this

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,019
rim researcher motion going to continue

00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:18,579
with unix so q nyx is an operating

00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:20,379
system that is a real other that

00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:24,820
homelessness the only real time

00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:27,369
operating system it is a serious it's a

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,429
very serious operating system and it is

00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:32,979
very sweet and so it used to be open

00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:35,049
source and then rim research motion

00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:37,779
bought it and then they closed part of

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,459
the source and but they still q next

00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:42,549
they still release BSP which is the

00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:44,379
board support of pact platform to where

00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:48,369
you know like there's a beat their BSP

00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:50,229
for the panda board for whether the two

00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:51,879
best best piece for penny board is BSP

00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:55,059
for beagleboard beaglebone and

00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:57,459
beagleboard and so you know q nicks runs

00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,739
on a lot of a lot of embedded stuff it

00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:02,200
likes to say this it's real time you

00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:05,529
know linux it's not it's not real time

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,709
symbian OS is real time but q nixes is

00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:09,700
pretty hardcore arch linux so the guy

00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:14,529
that

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:17,590
what's your name again buddy jason is a

00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:20,440
arch linux guy and so there is arch

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:41,620
linux arm and they just was just monday

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:43,740
that so all you arch heads you can jump

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,500
right on it and make it happen gentoo

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,720
fedora you know fedora arm works debbie

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:53,080
is so now now that the thing is that now

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,789
with some of these OS as though you can

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,710
run your favorite or west but it's kind

00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:01,809
of like why would you run an OS that

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,539
doesn't that doesn't afford you the

00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,669
acceleration you know so it's the thing

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:08,919
of okay yeah i really want to run into

00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:11,169
on this thing but you know you've got a

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,630
hdmi port you've got video acceleration

00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:17,159
you've got libraries and things that you

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:19,960
actually need to run acceleration and

00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,970
its secret sauce you'll never know it

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,620
tastes good it's there but you'll never

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:28,149
get the recipe oh yeah yeah yeah it's

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,240
like it's like everything else you know

00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:34,360
I mean except for the Mallee 500 all of

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,120
these gpus are completely shut down you

00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,200
get binaries and you get I'm going to

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,360
talk a little more about that a minute

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,870
but you get it you can get it from the

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,880
manufacturer but you can't build it so

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,460
that so that's why I said it's not fair

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,580
as far as the ecosystem goals because

00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:56,200
bhutesu and linaro and and and you know

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:58,450
in their mix they get things whereas the

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,340
Fedora guys will have that the arts guys

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,620
won't have it other destroys won't have

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,350
it unless you are you know it's unless

00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:12,130
you join linaro yeah so Android is

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:14,529
Android is is there angstrom is a nice

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,990
operating system is there as well open

00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:18,000
where plan 9 is very obscure but you can

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,360
run it on

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,790
arm too and so these are what these are

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,550
the distros an OS that are supported

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,040
that solid run stairs okay we know this

00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,710
works it actually is ship suitable to

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,050
1004 and you know that's kind of old but

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:38,160
that was like the last supportive

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:42,120
release you know of boo to that ran on

00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:44,190
you know arm unlike arm v7 and so it's

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,020
got the 2.63 to Colonel their newer

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,200
kernels and you can actually run a boat

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,480
to core beta twelve point oh four and

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,270
you can get it up with like a 3.31

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,120
kernel and you know you can you can run

00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,280
the the latest and greatest but you got

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,170
to do all the footwork you know it's

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:06,840
it's a bit of work android froyo that's

00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:11,880
very old too but you know it is

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:16,080
supported so you say okay so what you

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,840
know does anybody not understand why

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,060
this device is awesome no really i mean

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,160
i'm good because I've seen it so people

00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:26,550
say okay you know they look at it they

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:32,100
turn it around where is it actually okay

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:34,740
let me make sure it's not empty okay so

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,750
so so people say you know so so so what

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,280
like you know it's got this you say it's

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,400
got that you know why should i buy this

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,380
what can I do with it you know like what

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,970
is really the purpose cuz you know I

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,250
mean you got it you got to kind of have

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,610
some vision or being enthusiasts to

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:53,670
really like get it right away so there

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:58,860
are a big list of the video modes that

00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:01,920
it supports and so you know it can it

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,950
can display the star trek enterprise and

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:11,070
screen it can it can do some big some

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:14,310
big resolutions so there is the flash so

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:17,340
I just saw a run actually has a pack

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,830
that packages available flash media

00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,560
player there's a flash media player 10

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:26,880
application and there's a flash meter

00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:31,440
plugin and so you install those uh those

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,480
their packages and you go to you too

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,940
and it'll work in firefox they also

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,809
built they've also built chromium so you

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:43,230
know you can win a google chrome and you

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:46,350
can do to 1080p stream and it'll play

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,120
all day long no frills so if you if you

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,669
and you guys have Netflix you can you

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,129
can you know watch all your movies on

00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,919
netflix online you know some people

00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,570
watch like soap operas and stuff you can

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,580
watch your soaps you know through the

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,220
browser you know right on your big

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,389
screen TV you know so that was just you

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,360
know me just going through kind of

00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:09,840
clicking just to show you know things

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,720
that they have it flash works it is so

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,259
you don't have to use gnashing and hope

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:21,570
that it works this is an Adobe Flash

00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:25,350
plugin it comes from Adobe from marv it

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:29,039
from adobe to marvel two solid run to

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:32,490
you it is a flash plugin so like you

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,210
look at roku look at WD live all of

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,549
these devices they can do flash you know

00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,159
but they have to pay big bucks to be

00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:43,500
able to do that flash this is the only

00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,659
developer device that i have seen that

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,940
has the Flash plugin and you don't have

00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,350
to be an engineer with the company you

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,419
know and your liking some you know

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,580
bunker you know playing with the device

00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:55,379
you know and this is out in a while you

00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,259
know you can you can download it and

00:28:55,379 --> 00:29:02,690
that is major for this platform made

00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,690
this mess major for embedded in itself

00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:08,490
so another big thing about the cubox of

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,950
that you see all of that it can do all

00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:14,100
of this but you can't cook an egg on it

00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,620
it doesn't get that hot the power

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:20,909
footprint of this device bennett it is

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:23,309
an ARM processor is very miniscule it is

00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:25,860
very very miniscule so it will run

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,870
between three and four wats but in

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,309
running three and three to four wats

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:35,070
that is on the AC side on the DC side

00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:38,250
it's actually running over half of that

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:43,200
so you know the converter you lose a lot

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:44,110
in converting from from 120 volts down

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,420
to five

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,720
you know what I mean so this guy runs 25

00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:55,980
votes so what do you think it will cost

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:58,960
you in a year to run his Q box 24 7

00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,380
somebody's guess it doesn't matter you

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,450
can say 500 months that was an awesome

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:13,870
guess it was wrong to dollars and

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:19,540
Tencent 24 hours sweet to run said again

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:21,130
please yeah so he said he said yeah he

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,710
so he said it had a common set the east

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:31,059
side you said it he say to uh yeah yeah

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:33,490
so any yeah it's 24 hours a day you can

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:37,720
leave it running you can I mean you're

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:40,000
not know the TV it alarm clocks consume

00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,270
more power than anything and so in it

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,179
you're getting 1080p video you got a

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:48,760
cryptographic encryption security

00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,919
accelerator in that thing you've got to

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,720
tea and 3d video acceleration in there

00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:55,830
you've got speed if audio in there

00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:00,429
you've got gigabit ethernet in there and

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:03,130
you can pay just 2010 it's somewhere

00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:05,559
around like I forgot how much it was a

00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,360
day it's I mean and that's a nice

00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,090
Charlotte prices that's that you know

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,980
around eight cents a wide or a killer

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:15,790
killer line yeah for killer kilowatt

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:19,500
here in the area so you know you try to

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:22,450
run your desktop laptop will be like 20

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:28,630
26 y no no I'm thinking Adam it's like

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:30,790
126 Watson yeah you know and so and the

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,260
laptop ain't doing all that I mean he of

00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,970
course you know it's portable I mean

00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,440
you're not gonna take this on a plane

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:39,700
and then try to you know you can't type

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,140
on it but uh but for what it is you know

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,340
if you want to server that that's the

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,470
big thing you know like you got the

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,140
server at the end of the bed and you

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,390
kick it in the fan is like you know got

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,400
all these like moths in it you know

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,220
that's like that's that's not that's not

00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,929
what to do and so at the end what you're

00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,429
paying for that is heating up the room

00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,179
you got

00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:03,419
for AC and things so the reason why arm

00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:05,879
we really are seen a revolution in

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,129
computing with these arm devices because

00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:11,879
this is going to the data center you

00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:13,230
know if that is what it costs because

00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:16,259
the data said everything's about power

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,769
how much you're paying for you know /

00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:21,299
amp / you know and then cooling how much

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:24,539
is cooling so when you have something

00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:27,929
with such a low power footprint you can

00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:34,169
cram a bunch of these in one space also

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:38,369
and pay you know fractions of what you

00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:42,029
pay for like you know big metal x86

00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:44,369
stuff Adam you know the I think Adam

00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:48,389
Adam of will get down like 26 wats it

00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:51,450
gets nowhere near what arm can do as far

00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:54,749
as power consumption so you know this is

00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,950
a this is stuff that you just don't just

00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:59,039
don't see everywhere as far as

00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:03,529
combination of hardware and power

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:06,749
footprint so is that going to work did I

00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:09,360
do something so that is proof right

00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:11,749
there when I told you that it was it

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,950
runs so it will win 3 watts all day long

00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:19,169
but that is a DC in line meter that I

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,259
have watt meter and so I put that in

00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:25,499
between the power supply and the cubox

00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:27,119
so the pump supplies over here and the Q

00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:30,539
boxes on this end so it's actually

00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,460
telling me what it's asking for from the

00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:35,669
power supply before it gets converted

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,320
like a lot of the other the other like

00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:40,080
meters that you'll see like the kilowatt

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,659
it's on the AC side so it's only showing

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,369
you after conversion what it's asking

00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,220
for it's not showing you actually what

00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:50,249
the chip is asking for thee that that

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:56,399
that Shiva core that that PJ for

00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:58,559
processor itself runs sub 1 Y just just

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,690
naked you know with no ethernet know us

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,179
being nothing nothing connected to it

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,850
runs below 1 watt so with all those

00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:07,950
other peripherals and all those

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:10,500
ph miles of physical hardware devices on

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:14,460
the die connected and you sending

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:18,270
traffic it's really one in 1.5 wat so if

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,619
you had like an array of like car

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,970
batteries and you were running well some

00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,550
people run off the grid and if you're

00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:27,149
running DC this wow you know that's big

00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:33,929
savings but it really in actuality it's

00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:36,780
it wants its sub 2 y so you know liquor

00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,369
dog thinks that is amazing you know I

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,760
mean think think about it is it's

00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:44,250
running you have this little bitty thing

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,450
this process of this whole system and so

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,389
that's why it's a soc it's a

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:54,270
system-on-a-chip little literally it's

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:55,649
got everything on it so here's the right

00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,859
you know I mean so that's the first

00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:00,660
thing you do when you see a device it's

00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:02,460
like even like like this mouse I want to

00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,030
take it apart I just got it I wanted to

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,490
tell what's in it so I took it apart

00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,339
what no I didn't take it apart we're not

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,750
gonna say that because I want to watch

00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:16,920
somebody took it apart and I was there

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:22,859
and took pictures they took there's a

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:26,520
part not mine and so you know that's you

00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:28,109
know Q box right there that's the bottom

00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,490
there therefore you know you guys saw

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:32,819
the four little feet you just peel those

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,619
off four screws basic stuff but i'll

00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:37,319
tell you what that thing is crammed in

00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:41,520
there so once you get that off you

00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:44,130
pretty much got bored and sink you know

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,450
that that metal part going around is it

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:48,450
actually sits right up against the

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:51,030
processor and that's used as a heat sink

00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,910
of course there's no it's just passive

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:57,299
you know of cooling convection so to

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,640
speak and so on it there's no fan

00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:02,670
there's nothing else there's this that's

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,170
what you got and that is that's what

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,780
does the cooling it doesn't get that hot

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,660
actually either when even when you're

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,150
you're doing a 1080p video I mean I'll

00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,740
play Maintenon love them everybody loves

00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,049
a matrix so you know i'm playing a

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,859
matrix and i'm watching jurassic park

00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,650
and you know

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,539
it's like you don't smell like you know

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,430
like hair cooking or something you know

00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:26,400
it's not like so like the other plot

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,839
like like I got pandaboard and you can

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,519
smell it once you start doing some

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,589
intensive stuff like i'll build kernels

00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,920
on it and you can you can smell it can't

00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:38,069
you tell them you can smell it don't you

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,460
either he's a pen at work so you know

00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:45,359
that's the just a you know a front view

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,930
of it naked and so if you think size

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,109
wise that is chapstick right there that

00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:55,380
is a small small device and this board

00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:57,749
on the top actually it wants to come off

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,210
but it was soldered on and I started

00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:02,279
it's only two pins that they don't even

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:05,369
go to anything it's just to keep it from

00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:07,499
whenever you go putting in you know rj45

00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:09,150
connectors that it won't break and I

00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:11,059
started to desolder it just to show you

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,089
was underneath it I said I'm not gonna

00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:17,160
well actually actually you know what I

00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,779
hooked up I had my I have my helping

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,779
hands hooked up I had to start around

00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:23,670
herself and I walked out and then I came

00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:25,829
back in I did something and I kicked in

00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,140
I like burned the carpet so I I said

00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:32,339
screw it you know I didn't want to I was

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,980
mad then and so there's a side view of

00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:39,690
it and so big deal another big deal

00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:43,170
seeing that picture it's got a real time

00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:47,220
clock that's backed by battery that is a

00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:50,309
big deal that's that's a that's a really

00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:53,190
big deal pandaboard doesn't have it so

00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:56,460
you know you're restarting this is you

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,869
know 1962 or you know something like

00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,970
every time we started maybe a different

00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:03,529
time angstrom is the only operating

00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:07,259
system that that will keep time for you

00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:10,130
anything else not going to happen so

00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:10,130
that battery

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,380
that's that's not that's not how to us

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,670
that's a chip he saw the question the

00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,010
access it doesn't have the pins he's

00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:23,730
he's wanting to know if there are

00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:25,800
headers or you know yes but now so he's

00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,410
when he wants like gpio so you could you

00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,930
know control something now you can you

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:36,390
can steal gpio from pretty much anything

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:38,849
but as far as on on the PCB there are no

00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,619
unpopulated headers it's so small that

00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:43,920
you know they engineered it to where you

00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,810
know it's it's right to spec point-blank

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,589
and it's going in a case it's not like

00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:51,540
it's naked what I will open you know so

00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:53,339
but this guy right edit the black thing

00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,339
facing that way that's the specific

00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:00,180
connector for the audio and right here

00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:02,579
is the actual ir receiver right there

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:07,460
for the infrared for the remote control

00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:12,930
oh and that's a better view of it but uh

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:17,520
see what we got in there is the

00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:21,420
processor itself and right above it is

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,490
the those are two of the memory chips

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:28,190
right there so that that is the one gig

00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:30,270
of ddr3 RAM running at 800 megahertz

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,460
that's a big that's another big deal

00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:36,480
okay so actually you know what we've got

00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,980
you got one set down at the bottom but

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,550
see that and one thing about the cubox

00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:45,500
as of right now there is no the

00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:51,240
documentation as far as you know the

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:52,829
what is this it's like board now I'm not

00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,810
trying to their specific name for I

00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:56,760
can't remember anybody but so there are

00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,730
reference of the reference design for it

00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,130
like all that data is not actually out

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:06,319
split for this specific reference design

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:09,660
so you know some like if you look at the

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:12,510
pen look at panda beagleboard beaglebone

00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,190
TI does a really good job at documenting

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,410
things and so you know if you got like

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,510
an oscilloscope you know okay this clock

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:22,050
is right here you probe that pin you can

00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,760
find it you know what every bus signal

00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,010
was doing and you know every day all of

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,570
the pins and every signal on each pan

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:32,160
is documented for you you know you don't

00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,410
get that that is yet that is the bottom

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,960
so that's right where that that heat

00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:41,060
sink oh you know touch on that guy and

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,070
then I'll radiate the heat above it so

00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,620
that's the end of that right here I'm

00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,360
going to try to do this demo so if you

00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,360
need you know any information about

00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:55,050
cubox you go to solid run comp really if

00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,210
you just Google q box then you know

00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,880
solid run to come right up and you go to

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,610
site jump on the forum jump on the wiki

00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,140
and you guys on IRC jump in the IRC

00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,950
channel there you know quite a few guys

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,960
in there the CTO rubia he's in there and

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,420
he's I mean like he's the guy who does

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,330
the majority of the of the of the

00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,620
colonel work he used to work for Marvel

00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:20,520
he's a he's a he's a really he's a

00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:24,120
really novel engineer so let's see if I

00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:29,970
can uh I got it hooked up to the this

00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:38,550
guy right here and let's see if it'll

00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:45,090
come on come on baby which it's not

00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:48,510
going to be instantaneous but and if

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:57,450
that if that don't work out we reboot it

00:41:48,510 --> 00:42:01,980
was this request Oh ah that's the that's

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:06,060
not it so uh wait what tell me if that

00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,850
light goes off on a friend okay all

00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:13,340
right so now let's see if we can get it

00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:13,340
back to this source here

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:32,470
I keep finding that thought is no work

00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:38,360
right there your season then I got my

00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:40,400
card in there sometimes it takes a

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,930
little second when I stayed up all night

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,610
and I actually I was one of the one of

00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:49,000
these rooms and I got everything you

00:42:43,610 --> 00:43:01,520
know work at some of the demos let me

00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:03,830
disconnect this guy right here okay more

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:15,190
time anybody got any questions you know

00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:19,369
any anything said again please yeah oh

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:23,859
really think that's what that is you

00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:29,060
might be very so it is it is umbria oh

00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:31,250
it costs 130 nine dollars us and this it

00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:35,440
sounds better in ninety nine year olds

00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:39,440
but you know we don't really you know so

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:43,000
hey you gotta yeah and then you gotta

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,430
hit that inner yeah but uh so right now

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:51,680
up there it is BAM so right now you

00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:54,230
can't exactly get it because you know

00:43:51,680 --> 00:44:01,600
it's a pretty hot demand for these guys

00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:06,020
and they just sell out like right away

00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:10,730
okay so it's just like you know any

00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:15,380
other platform you know as far as you're

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:22,840
in top buddy let's get a let's blow it

00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:26,650
up try to get this bigger for you oops

00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,650
missed that tee

00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:39,860
let me spend it here a little bit so and

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:45,110
right now I can I could make it do I had

00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:50,930
it during nineteen eighty x 1080 1920 x

00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:53,450
1080 yeah I had it doing 1600 x 1200 you

00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:59,590
know right now is set it up optimized

00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,590
for the for the projector at 1024 x 768

00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:09,760
but uh well yes so yeah you you cannot

00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,760
you allocate that

00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:32,180
said again please I didn't I didn't I

00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:39,830
didn't hurt you I I stood in here what

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:45,950
she said okay so so I've got let's see

00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:51,470
which one is she see that sound over

00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:53,150
hdmi right there so you can ignore it

00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,550
look stuff for the beginning so right

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:59,690
here you can you can set your resolution

00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:01,610
right in there it was something that I

00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:07,070
was why I went there I can't remember

00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:08,900
why yeah yeah babe I'm something else

00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:12,290
that I was willing to show I want to

00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:18,980
talk about in there I had a brain for it

00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:20,390
I don't remember okay so now I just got

00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:32,510
this keyboard so I'm not used to it at

00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:36,230
all which one might work so I don't know

00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,540
this might not work it works everywhere

00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:48,140
else but ok that was not going to work

00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:51,650
but this guy right here will work it's

00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:57,740
going to look like crap button it'll

00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:59,000
work and so it's this projector like as

00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,940
you saw some the screenshots that I

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,600
showed you in the presentation that you

00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,550
know it it looks and it moves fast you

00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,910
know it's it's quake three you know and

00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:13,160
so this is using our open G OpenGL ES so

00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,400
anything that supports OpenGL ES you can

00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:19,610
use you can leverage the acceleration in

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,260
your hardware and you know it'll show

00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:24,170
what actually it's kind of clearing up

00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,420
now somewhat it'll show no frills and

00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,700
you know you can get you know pretty

00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,210
good frames per second out of it and

00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:37,520
what

00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:41,810
but um let me see make sure ok so then

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,390
there's another little cheesy demo in

00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:53,930
here where it just pretty much it just

00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:55,940
draws an image well I'm good sir so

00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,370
those are like I don't know like titles

00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,740
of movies but this projector is like

00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:03,170
completely screwing up and so what it's

00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:05,630
supposed to do when its larger it'll

00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:07,580
it'll stop on their to rotate and then

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:10,760
it'll you know spend a few different

00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:14,060
ways and it's very high resolution and I

00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,250
mean I thing is like blazing through you

00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:19,460
know that meteorite has so what I also

00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:23,530
have is I have a video or I have a

00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,530
couple video clips

00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:31,329
yeah there it is oh I completely

00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:37,989
overlook that so you know when good old

00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:43,689
totem and maybe maybe it'll work I don't

00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:45,609
know I really don't know I haven't tried

00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:48,160
to I haven't tried to play this and

00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:51,039
actually I I was a bad boy and I

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,589
downloaded it over our stereoscopic 3d

00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:57,880
that that is that's something else right

00:48:53,589 --> 00:49:02,049
there we're in livery let me see

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:07,900
something I've got another one I can

00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:11,890
hear audio and I don't that ain't it's

00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:18,180
not what we want here no what we want it

00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:18,180
so simple MKV what is that one

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:31,490
I well I didn't download it it came that

00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:33,289
was already there hey monster oh that's

00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:35,599
stereoscopic 3d too i remember that one

00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:43,059
no that won't work either okay so now i

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:46,670
have something in the cubox directory ok

00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:50,480
now the the audio on this thing is kind

00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:55,339
of screwed up but uh of course you can't

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,890
see it can you hear that over whose

00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:59,960
cover close to the projector but so so

00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:03,950
just imagine this little bitty thing

00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,740
next to York or underneath the TV so

00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:11,569
let's see what's going on here yeah it

00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:13,940
kind of like it doesn't you know it that

00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:15,859
projector of something as I stayed up I

00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,829
haven't been sleeping yet actually but

00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:21,259
uh I stayed up all night and I got some

00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:23,509
things working but like pretty much

00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:26,660
nothing that really was worth showing in

00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:29,420
regards to the 3d acceleration and 1080p

00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,099
stuff worked you know it took sound

00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:33,079
never work when I was trying it before

00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:35,420
it just it just worked but that's what

00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:38,269
kind of surprised me we just imagine

00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:41,119
having this you know next to your TV

00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:43,960
just on all the time and so you know

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,859
it's multi-purpose so you can have it

00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,690
downloading torrents let's just say

00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:49,359
you're downloading operating system

00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:55,579
torrents that are free and open source

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:57,140
you know and you know and and so uh you

00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:00,170
know it can be downloading torrents it

00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:03,019
could be you know app cache repository

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,329
it can be an ldap server I've got you

00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:07,460
know I've got one doing pretty much all

00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:09,890
of that stuff and as I said it's staying

00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,759
under their power envelope and you know

00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:16,359
it's multi-purpose and it's also a media

00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:16,359
center for me

00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:40,710
really so like I was telling you guys

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,300
about the mt into mt you if you try to

00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,850
run this command or something that's not

00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,820
Giggy you know it'll scare to bark at

00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:49,650
you so you can you can set them to you

00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,900
too and so that's what they call jumbo

00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,790
frames yeah and so you know I mean you

00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,990
you hook it right up to you now all you

00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,930
gotta do is get yourself a gigabit

00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:02,010
router and you're cooking with grease

00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:03,900
buddy well that's what I mean get switch

00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:07,650
router what's the difference Robin got

00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,300
switched bill but now you know but it's

00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,810
when it's not one of the same but its

00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,180
built-in so we get security in here for

00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:19,220
this guy anybody got any other questions

00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,220
any other concerns any other anything

00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,250
well you can run a myth box front end

00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:30,840
but you really want to use XBMC and XBMC

00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:32,790
has got that CEC so if you if you hook

00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:36,570
it up to your TV and you press power or

00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:38,730
you you know you shut down the XBMC

00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,230
it'll shut off the TV just like that you

00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,420
know so everything works there's there's

00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:45,840
a district the distribution called xilka

00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:49,440
and it is you got XBMC already built

00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:52,500
prepackaged and I think it's mom I think

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,140
it's like Thank You slack or at least

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,280
two but it doesn't matter what it's

00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,340
based on you know you just want the

00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,550
media center aspect of it so your xbox

00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:04,220
media center is really the way to go

00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:06,390
mythtv the front end you can do but it

00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,300
hasn't been built yet for a platform

00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:14,520
because pretty much it's very new in

00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:17,400
that regard anybody else any other

00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:22,490
questions well anything anyway I want to

00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,490
see I can showed msg if you want to

00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:36,020
sit again please oh oh yeah well it's

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:41,620
actually it's not a lot in there so it's

00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:44,750
not a lot in there at all not a lot

00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:50,150
whatever you know it shows you know i WM

00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:51,800
m xt that's a big deal Tommy vsp and so

00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,320
with this Colonel I mean it pretty much

00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:58,220
no no modules or nothing everything's

00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:02,510
built in so you know you you really

00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:06,620
won't see it but uh yeah of course it is

00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:11,510
and so as so it shows as like the Marvel

00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:13,160
delft platform which is like a netbook

00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:17,180
net top whatever you want to call the

00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:20,300
thing and a lot of support because it's

00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:24,470
based on the same up you know court and

00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:28,010
so let's see if there's anything in an

00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:29,510
interesting to show you here and so you

00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:32,750
can also it also the scale and so it'll

00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:35,480
scale from it'll go from eight mag down

00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:41,180
of no 800 megahertz down to 400

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:45,860
megahertz you know so you see the pmu so

00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:47,510
this is scott it's showing you know cpu

00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:50,330
all the processing units is showing you

00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:54,770
right there what speed they are the jl

00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:59,830
core for the four-year cpu frequency

00:54:54,770 --> 00:55:03,740
scaling sasa that's the cryptographic

00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:05,750
encryption security accelerator about

00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,550
the Bob we should haves or in here

00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:10,610
somewhere to let and all that stuff is

00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:13,040
built into the kernel actually V matter

00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:18,670
that's what's doing your acceleration

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,670
for your 1080p and so there's your seder

00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,520
stuff going on right there that's

00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,900
actually so it's a watchdog timer in

00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,300
there too so if you know if any you guys

00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,100
are doing something you know like you're

00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,530
trying to put some sort of rover on Mars

00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:33,380
or something and you know you want it to

00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:36,740
always be up and if it's if it can't do

00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:38,690
something the watchdog timer will so you

00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:41,450
can say okay if you can't ping this IP

00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:45,140
address or if you can't touch this file

00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:46,930
or if the cpu utilization gets above a

00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,030
certain point if it becomes unresponsive

00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:51,320
it will reach it will restart it it'll

00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:54,080
automatically it doesn't matter what

00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,630
state is saying it'll restart it and you

00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,450
can't want you but once you set that you

00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:01,880
can get you can up in a loop and you

00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:05,780
know I mean you you can turn it off but

00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,070
while it's up and you if you have an

00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,960
issue you know you got to be quick

00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:11,690
enough to try to catch it and then send

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,410
a module the the argument where you know

00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:22,160
it'll turn it off what else is in there

00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:24,890
for you there's yours or as I was saying

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:29,540
for you know that actually is in between

00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:32,090
all your rights and your reads from you

00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,850
know all your media which is a big deal

00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:37,160
like you know like the big SSDs have it

00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,470
raid arrays that's you know I mean

00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:47,540
that's like you know topping out stuff

00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:51,470
right there and so hdmi probing the

00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:56,450
framework buffer and there it is I think

00:56:51,470 --> 00:57:01,870
okay so yeah asked how they provide the

00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:06,550
chrono passes so there is a git tree

00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:09,350
this is out there there Dropbox

00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:13,250
downloads I mean they're quite a few

00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:15,200
methods it's it's not as uniform as a

00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:16,670
lot of people would like it to be so

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,030
that's one thing about this device that

00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:23,690
if you get it if you're a dabbler you

00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:27,290
may have it may be steeper orange ramp

00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:29,300
you know so maybe i'll make it easy for

00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:31,430
some people but you know as it's

00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,960
everything's not out there for you so if

00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:35,720
you want if you want something working

00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,750
like just like that now what in out of

00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,330
the box you get ubuntu 10 for running

00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,920
but

00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,540
none acceleration none of that stuff is

00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,850
there because they can't distribute it

00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,100
they can't send that to you like that so

00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:50,880
you have to then go online and download

00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:53,580
this uh the star which has you know

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,930
everything in it like google chrome and

00:57:53,580 --> 00:58:00,570
the flash player plug-in and and then

00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:02,280
you install that and all the other

00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,320
packages that will do you know scaling

00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:09,230
as far as I for the cpu and all of that

00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:13,940
and you know you're off and running

00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:13,940
somebody was kind of had a hand up oh

00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,380
yeah you can yeah that's that's actually

00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:24,180
on that on that slide of course my

00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,040
slides up here you can boot over yeah

00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,380
you can boot over so the question was

00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,710
was remote booting like you know can you

00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:34,260
can you boot the device without needing

00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:38,730
any physical storage attached so yes you

00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:40,230
can boot from NFS well I can't show that

00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,710
because I have to reboot it to show you

00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:45,800
yeah okay but yeah yeah so so you can

00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:48,780
you can boo you can boot from various

00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,700
tftp with pixie boots all of that all

00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,460
that works you know like right out of

00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:56,100
the box you know it happens in a you

00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,560
boop and then it'll mount your route

00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:01,140
from your NFS mount and then you know

00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,590
pull the Connell from there to you know

00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,590
all that

00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:20,370
yeah it is a good idea maybe you should

00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:27,600
do that maybe I'll still that idea from

00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:31,140
you and then I'll be rich yeah anybody

00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:34,110
else I think we're about it's about it

00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:36,660
on the time so as I said go to solid run

00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,270
calm support the project support the

00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,190
product get it and as I said you know

00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,470
it's a developing community is steadily

00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:45,390
evolving so there will be more updates

00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:47,280
there will be you know more people

00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:49,380
streamlining streamlining things and

00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,400
more developers to get on board to wear

00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,110
because right now there's a big user

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,320
base and they're not enough developers

00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:57,270
so you found God saying hey you know I

00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,180
can't set the clock or you know and then

00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:02,820
the form is full of guys having in user

01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:04,170
issues versus guys actually saying okay

01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,970
well you know I set up this repo hair

01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:07,890
you know I want to build this distro or

01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:10,530
hey I notice something in the kernel so

01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:14,340
that's more what's needed for this

01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:17,370
project so my name is Brian Smith the

01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:24,780
cubox go to solid run comm check it out

01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:27,540
jump on irc.freenode.net one in

01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:30,330
contributing I'm always on RC idle in

01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:33,450
like 40 channels so you know if you see

01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:35,220
me on Brian Stein and IRC and uh you

01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:38,780
know just send me a PM or something and

01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,780
now you know help you out if you got one

01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:36,309
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:38,470
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:41,950
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:45,750
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:49,269
happening in open source the

01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:51,099
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:53,200
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:55,180
these are these you know these these

01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,460
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:00,339
discovered and then fixed is it I think

01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:03,339
that really shows the power of the of

01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:05,789
the open source community it is global

01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:09,339
and it's definitely because of the users

01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:15,220
community people are extremely friendly

01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:17,019
and always ready to help if you go an

01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,180
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:21,880
helping each other out and they're all

01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:23,559
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,579
product is transparent for everyone

01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:29,769
everyone can look at the code base

01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:31,980
everyone can see how CloudStack is being

01:02:29,769 --> 01:02:37,480
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:40,089
everything is open in many ways it's

01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:44,589
absolutely vital to the the unborn

01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:48,789
helped CloudStack the most exciting

01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:51,640
event in recent memory for me was our

01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:54,280
first developer boot camp

01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,920
and our call gave people like maybe two

01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:00,880
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:05,050
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,900
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:10,420
chairs in the room twice everything

01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:13,750
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:16,720
is open source and so I don't think that

01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:18,490
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,520
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:24,220
computing and so i think it's i think

01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,600
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:29,310
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,310
talking about it source cloud computing

01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:35,650
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:38,050
deployments you have dozens of data

01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:42,070
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:45,310
data centers these hardware is going to

01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:48,550
fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:51,010
handle number one that mass scale number

01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:53,740
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,620
that inevitably happens in large

01:03:53,740 --> 01:04:00,790
deployments started working on contact

01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:04,090
over four years ago and it was the

01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:05,860
original set of people working on it had

01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:09,940
a background of delivering software

01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:14,200
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:17,800
lots of users actually using it high

01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:20,890
availability is the key feature multiple

01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:22,900
hypervisors support different network

01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:25,600
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:27,850
you better while step management server

01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:31,540
can be deployed in different physical

01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:33,190
machines it definitely has a huge

01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:38,170
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:40,780
there's a major movie studio that they

01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:44,050
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:46,030
to transcode video and i thought that

01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,680
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:50,950
more fascinating is what they did during

01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:53,740
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:55,120
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:57,810
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:01,210
the instances and go back to doing

01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:02,710
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,600
different aspects and there's no one

01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:07,270
person that's kind of like a master of

01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:11,080
all those realms I think clouds stack as

01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:13,300
a project is going to be one of the

01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:17,350
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:22,780
most feature fallen and and robust

01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:25,680
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,680
living through the clouds dag

01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,570
you

01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,690
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:50,910
ago we could not have imagined that

01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:53,099
asterisk would not only become the most

01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:55,260
widely adopted open source communication

01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:57,300
software on the planet but that it would

01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,820
impact the entire industry in the way

01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,770
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:04,410
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:06,390
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:08,460
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:09,869
transition of power from the hands of

01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,150
the traditional proprietary phone

01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:14,550
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:16,470
administrators of phone systems using

01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,700
this power our customers have created

01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,650
all sorts of business changing

01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,510
applications from small office phone

01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:24,030
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,619
the international carrier networks in

01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:27,420
fact there's even an entire country

01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:30,000
those communications infrastructure runs

01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:31,920
on esters the gym has always been about

01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,630
creating technology that expands

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,820
communications capabilities in ways that

01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:37,020
we could never have imagined and that's

01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,750
part of what's game-changing about

01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:42,089
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:44,190
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:46,290
IP phones that extends control of the

01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:48,060
user all the way to the desktop the

01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,770
launch of these new products represents

01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,869
the next phase indigenous history of

01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:54,270
innovation these are the first and only

01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:55,980
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:57,540
power of esters when we first discussed

01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,580
our expectations for building a family

01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:01,710
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,450
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:05,099
the team to build the phones such that

01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:07,290
they were easy to install integrate

01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:09,150
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:11,700
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,349
that goal user feedback is validating

01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,450
that when it comes to operation with

01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:17,880
asher space systems including our own

01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:20,460
Switchvox based product these are the

01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,750
easiest to use best integrated most

01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,359
interoperable products on the market

01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:26,339
today the digitally of phones will

01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:28,410
initially include three IP desk phones

01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:30,330
uniquely designed to complement any

01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:32,190
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:34,859
these phones are different for a number

01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:37,530
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:38,940
designed for use with esters secondly

01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,580
we've made it really easy to

01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,960
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:44,640
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,349
to access information inside of

01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,050
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:49,600
between

01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:51,490
application and the phone additionally

01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,770
we've created an applications engine

01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:55,990
that allows users and developers to

01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,720
create and run their own apps on the

01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:00,820
phone and finally we've done all of this

01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,530
at a very compelling price point at

01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:04,750
Digium we're always thinking of ways to

01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:07,090
give our customers the best value in

01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:08,470
business phone systems and also give

01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:10,480
them the power to create their own

01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,280
solutions or eating communications

01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,960
challenge will continue to push the

01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,670
boundaries not only to make astros

01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,620
cooler faster more technologically

01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:19,180
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:21,370
what communications even easier and

01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:24,870
together we'll change the way the world

01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:24,870
