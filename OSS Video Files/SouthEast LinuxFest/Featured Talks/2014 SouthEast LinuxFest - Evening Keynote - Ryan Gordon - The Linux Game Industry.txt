the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

pc org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,859
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,410
videos possible okay so for our closing

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,900
keynote obviously Ryan Gordon many of

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,059
you in here refer to him as achelous the

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,710
gentleman who's way overdressed for our

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,950
crowd but we'll let that go because we

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,530
all play his game ports so Ryan is

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,510
actually a Charlotte local and if you've

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,520
played any major commercial Linux game

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,950
the odds are not a hundred percent that

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,610
he is the one who ported it which means

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,809
he probably has some good code stories

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,600
anyway so we're running behind so

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,489
without further ado Nick euless okay can

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,140
you all hear me thank you can you all

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,040
hear me as the microphone working okay

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,600
good cool so we'll start we're running

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
late thank you we all got to make fun of

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,830
a Macintosh before we started so we're

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,390
already off to a good start here my name

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,490
is Ryan this is a talk called the Linux

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,320
game industry let's get started and

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,030
we'll just try to pretend this where

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,950
everything's okay okay a few notes

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,350
before we get started here first off

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,390
feel free to interrupt me if you have a

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,950
question raise your hand I'll repeat it

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,450
back so the microphone can hear it and

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,250
I'll pretend I know what I'm talking

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,900
about the slides will be at that URL

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,390
they're not there yet i'm going to put

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,860
some annotations in it afterwards and

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,380
some corrections and i will post it

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,369
later tonight so come back and check

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,579
there's nothing technical in today's

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,470
talk this is all about the business and

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,479
money and disgusting things like that

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,119
and just a more important if you're

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,920
disgusted by money in economies this is

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,100
also about archaeology and history which

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,170
I find I'm passionate about so I hope

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,939
you are too if you want to tweet about

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,579
this while it's going on that's a dick

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,009
Ulis is my Twitter account the hashtags

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,600
to self 2014's good if you have positive

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,340
comments negative comments I read them

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,830
all and I laughed and cry appropriately

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,330
okay so this is me my name is Ryan I've

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,100
been doing this for a long long time I'm

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,070
a hacker in the positive sense that word

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,860
I'm a game developer and mostly what

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,660
people think of me as is a game Porter

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,280
Porter being you know Latins Porto is to

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,650
carry I carry games from one platform to

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
another so i generally got get hired

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,870
take a Windows game and move it over

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,730
carry it over to linux I get hired to

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,140
pour stuff to mac OS I get hired to port

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,910
stuff to platforms that no one's ever

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,720
heard of before I'm probably never will

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,880
again but I'm a freelance I don't work

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,650
for anyone but myself people hire me on

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,150
a contract basis and I do work and then

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,250
I swooped in to the next project I've

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,960
been doing this for 15 years a little

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,250
more than 15 years now and yeah the best

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,380
way to explain what I do for a living is

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,550
to look at my nascar jacket these are

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,230
some of the companies I've worked for

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,420
this is actually out of dayton's in the

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,940
last two weeks so we just shipped two

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,320
games last night a goat simulator and

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,940
limbo if you haven't played them they're

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,520
both excellent for totally opposite

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,780
reasons and you know some of these

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,310
companies you've probably heard of like

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,690
Epic Games is up there valves up there

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,030
Google's up there I did Google Earth

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,230
blah blah blah some of these you might

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,370
not have heard of but they still shipped

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,490
really excellent games but my biggest

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,360
client right now is this lady that's

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,010
what she wears when she's using

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,110
bittorrent that's my daughter Olive she

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,280
keeps me running anyways for those that

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,870
just want to tune out they don't really

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,610
want to listen to this whole talk like

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,320
got about an hour here unless I do this

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,620
really quickly in which case I have 45

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,770
minutes for Q&A but here's the too long

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,550
didn't read this is how we started this

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,550
is where we are now

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,560
let's skip ahead a little bit okay so if

00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,510
anyone has ever played this game it's

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,030
called X bill does anyone not played

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,220
this game you can tell when people

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,270
started installing linux based on

00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,740
whether they've seen this game or not

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,110
basically this is just Bill Gates

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,400
multiple clones of Bill Gates this is

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,570
actually help Microsoft operates to

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,620
there's multiple clones of Bill Gates

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,120
running around destroying other

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,520
operating systems and you have to try

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,660
and squat squash him you know I guess

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,460
the mouse cursor probably looks like

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,040
Steve Ballmer at this point or whoever

00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,660
the new guys I put this up here for one

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,160
reason is that what you might notice is

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,620
this is a whole bunch of dead operating

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,270
systems that were totally relevant back

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,880
when this game for a ship there's SGI

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,470
workstations there's windows 31 there's

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,080
what I think is mac OS 9 there's next

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,190
step sadly in this picture there's no OS

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,760
to which is what I was using before

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,440
Linux other it oh it's the retina

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,860
display you know it's can't read it on

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,540
this thing okay I put this up here for a

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,460
very important reason to say let's skip

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,990
ahead there is so much history that I'm

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,430
not going to be able to cover today and

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,180
I could talk for hours and hours not

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,800
just about gaming an open source game

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,120
but specifically gaming on Linux so I

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,410
had to pick and choose and there's gonna

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,820
be some people that might see this talk

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,200
and feel like they should have been

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
mentioned I'm really sorry if you see

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,920
this on youtube and I skipped you I had

00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,450
to pick and choose I'm sorry so just

00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,950
pretend that this picture of X bill

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,060
represents everything we haven't talked

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,350
about and everything that came before

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,780
we're talking about cuz we're going to

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,350
jump directly in 1993 who's played this

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,140
game everyone in the room I love it good

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,760
good good doom is a first-person shooter

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,170
if for the one guy somewhere that I

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,610
couldn't see behind the flood of hands

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,200
that went up it's a first person shooter

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,340
it was one of the first of its kind it

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,020
was one of those games that when a ship

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,800
derrewyn said i did not know you could

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,270
do that on a 386 computer and you

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,950
basically you saw just the barrel of

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,710
your gun and you ran down the hall

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,510
shooting demons and the story was

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,650
totally irrelevant to anything it was

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,030
mostly you run around shoot things and

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,010
find keys and blah blah and it was

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,970
really beautiful at the time but I don't

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,380
really want to get in the history of

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,390
doom because there's in literally entire

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,300
books written about this game which you

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,460
should also read but this was one of the

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,890
first commercial games triple-a for the

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,280
time games that shipped with a linux

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,600
binary doom shipped it for das orig I'm

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,010
sorry its software the people made doom

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,510
shipped it for das originally and then

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,500
they shipped some

00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,850
they're updated versions I think they

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,630
did a Windows version there was actually

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,400
in fact an OS to version but eventually

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,740
it software themselves portal in

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,540
exported to Linux one the employees for

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,040
its software his name was Dave Taylor he

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,210
wrote the Linux he poured the Linux

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,460
version of this and you put the readme

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,810
file in there this is from readme Linux

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,820
I'll read it to you if you can't see the

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,800
screen it says I did this because linux

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,180
gives me a woody it doesn't generate

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,740
revenue please don't call us with bug

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,360
reports they cost us money and I sort of

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,220
get rag Don for wasting my time on unix

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,140
ports anyway true story Dave Taylor left

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,030
its software sometime after this point

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,250
and started his own company which did a

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,720
game called abuse for a company called

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,590
cracked com please don't go there

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,560
anymore i'm pretty sure it's a website

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,270
it's a porn site at this point but and

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,490
he ported that also de linux and then he

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,500
started on a big ambitious project

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,660
called golgotha which he ran out of

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,770
money doing and failed and just released

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,870
the source code to it he says it's not

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,370
done but if you can cherry-pick anything

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,110
from this including the art assets

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,470
including the code it's all yours do

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,520
what you can with it go wild so now

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,300
we're going to jump ahead a couple of

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,530
years who knows these people every time

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,150
I give this talk that hand the hand

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,680
count goes down a little bit that's okay

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,050
that's history for you we all fading the

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,280
background eventually in 1999 there was

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,170
a company called low key software they

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,880
ported a game called civilization called

00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,190
a power which was one of the

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,440
civilization games among many others and

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,610
they basically made a big splash she

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,160
said this is what we do we were going to

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,410
be a business we're going to port triple

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,110
a top-of-the-line top-shelf games to

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,720
linux and settle a boxed Linux version

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,340
of it and they did they shipped 18 games

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,860
one two three four five you know looks

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,790
like a tion Cal 18 games some of these

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,830
you've heard of some of them are a

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,060
little smaller but like you might not

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,200
have heard of Eric's ultimate solitaire

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,400
if you weren't a Mac user in the late

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,900
90s but it was an incredibly good

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,030
solitaire game but they also shipped

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,730
really really big games that were

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,950
important back then like you know to

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,900
send three and heretics to and things

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,310
that are some City you know Alpha

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,040
Centauri which is still awesome if you

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,090
have it believe it and in addition to

00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,500
shipping these they had one they didn't

00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,600
quite ship they were working on deus ex

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,860
when they went out of business and more

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,730
importantly these are important is

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,650
something I need to talk about in a

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,330
moment they had two games they didn't

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,920
port themselves but they were in charge

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,860
of maintenance on and that's quake 3

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,479
arena

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,830
and at which they did sell copy of but

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,199
they were mostly it was ported when they

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,789
got it and then they had people on staff

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,139
that improved the Linux version from

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:17,370
there an unreal tournament which is

00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,590
poured to linux and i have a story about

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,900
this i'm going to tell you some stories

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,550
i probably shouldn't tell tonight and

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,379
this is one of them unreal tournament

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,990
was maintained by loki and they ship the

00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,289
ship linux binaries for it you bought

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,599
the windows boxed copy and we shipped at

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,099
low key and installer for unreal

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
tournament that would install linux

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,479
native binaries for it and use the data

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,149
files from the retail CD this happened

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,490
because epic ship Epic Games people who

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,670
did Unreal Tournament shipped source

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,760
code to some parts of Unreal Engine one

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,079
enough that you could you know put your

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,220
own renderer into it if you want but you

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,779
didn't get everything you needed to

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,399
build the game from scratch they called

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,589
it open UT and it was a briefly lived

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,660
project but they did that and they had a

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,040
Linux port they did in house and when

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,110
you took those two things you could say

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,700
who say a better opengl renderer for the

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,320
existing linux binaries and there was a

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,339
guy in germany named Daniel Vogel who

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,230
did some work on open UT and made a much

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,769
much better opengl renderer for the

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,300
Linux version and that got so good that

00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,160
other licensees of epic started shipping

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,860
unreal games with Daniel's OpenGL

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,269
renderer epic started shipping it and it

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,910
was faster and more feature complete

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,140
than their direct3d renderer Daniel now

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,880
works for epic games which is perhaps

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,829
not survive surprising in fact he's one

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,199
of their technical leads there now but

00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:36,899
at the time he was working for low key

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,360
software he was there on a work visa in

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,800
America in Southern California and one

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,140
night he was angry at tim sweeney the

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,000
guy who runs Epic Games and he said you

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,230
know we I want to do more with open UT

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and they're not giving a source code

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,769
they're not helping us out so he wrote a

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,029
flame email you know like just a right

00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,430
angry middle of the night I'm just

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,990
pissed at you email to Tim Sweeney just

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,970
like you're not helping us you're not

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,140
supporting this community and you're you

00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,970
know some things you really shouldn't

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,240
say to people that are much richer than

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,589
you but Tim Sweeney got that email and

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,209
wrote back in the morning said well why

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,500
don't I throw low key a couple thousand

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:10,680
dollars you guys can maintain the Linux

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,750
port so sometimes your anger can be well

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,010
focused is what I'm saying so look II

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,260
did that

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,760
I have so much I can say about low key

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,350
but I don't want to spin all times the

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,460
whole time talking about what the most

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,870
important thing I loci because the

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,100
company doesn't exist anymore you can't

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,530
buy their products you can probably find

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,180
them on the internet but these games are

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,350
for all intensive purposes dead except

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,180
for people that are keeping them on life

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,670
support to work on newer versions of G

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,770
Lib C and newer kernels and blahdy

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,540
blahdy blahdy the one thing they did

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,860
that was incredibly smart is they

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,540
invested in Norma's amount of

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,450
engineering resources and open source

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,610
tools to of lots and lots of them they

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,380
had improvements to bugzilla they had

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,660
improvements to they wrote their own

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,160
custom soft software installer and the

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,750
really student of the GPL and it was

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,040
really nice it worked regardless of what

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,650
kind of package manager you had and

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,220
stuff it was called Loki setup and lots

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,020
of other things that as bit rot goes and

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,220
better products come up those aren't

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,390
that interesting but these are two

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,430
things that were magical that they

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,440
worked on and pushed harder than anyone

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,000
else and we still use them today the

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,340
first ones sdl it's simple direct media

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,840
layer it's what we use as the Linux

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,040
answers are DirectX if you want to get

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,810
to the screen if you wanna get to the

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,970
audio card if you want to get to the

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,170
joystick you probably right to sdl you

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,390
probably don't talk to Colonel

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,040
interfaces directly etc and when you do

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,260
that you get to all sorts of different

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,360
platforms for free it works on mac linux

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,040
windows android iOS blahdy blahdy blahdy

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,390
blah like lots of engineering resources

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,280
went into that low key it's the only

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,020
reason it survived to this point and we

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,730
used it and enhance as an open source

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,440
project for many years after Loki left

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,120
and we still do to this day where

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,800
several thousand commits into our

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,410
mercurial repository now the other

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,300
project they did was open al which is a

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,010
3d audio library which we needed to

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,450
compete with direct sound 3d when we're

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,370
at low key but it turned out to just be

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,380
a generally good idea if you have a

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,880
Linux box you probably have open al

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,320
installed on it if you have a Mac it is

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,990
absolutely installed on it starting with

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,910
mac OS 10.4 you if you have an iphone of

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,850
any variety its head open al since the

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,230
day it was launched you name it you've

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,660
probably got a system with open ale on

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,760
it the only thing that probably has more

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,180
installs by default and open at this

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,470
point is probably SQL Lite so this

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,420
worked out for look even though Loki

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,520
didn't survive we all benefited from

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,230
that strategy and located some other fun

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,250
stuff this attractive gentleman is

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,570
sitting on something called a rock and

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,480
ride

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,030
which is weird looking it's a bunch of

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,000
hydraulic things in a chair and a giant

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,470
CRT strapped to the front of it hmm and

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,510
what those hydraulics would do was move

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,490
the chair in weird and random angle so

00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,280
we'd hook this up to dissent 3 so as you

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,800
through flew around in 3d space this

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,440
chair would whip you around we pick that

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,150
up from some inventors garage in

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,460
Southern California or QA guy drove over

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,200
there with a pickup truck and we hooked

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,850
it up to dissent 3 and then we took it

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,590
to Linux world where Lester vaults

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,630
played with it I'm pretty sure he yelled

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,510
die while playing this just

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,750
i wish i had recording of it I promise

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:04,390
he did and he got whipped around playing

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:08,410
descent 3 but ok nothing lasts forever

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:10,050
look he went out of business and they

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,640
kind of had this really remarkable

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,190
operatic death spiral which I can't get

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,450
into even if I had the time but they

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,360
went out of business and then other

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,290
people picked up the slack some of these

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,790
you might have heard of maybe you

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,440
haven't there's a company called Linux

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,410
game publishing there was a web store

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,230
for linux games called tux gamescom and

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,670
their primary supplier video games was

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,250
low key games and low key went out of

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,480
business and they said oh so they

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,620
did the only thing they could if they

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,060
want to stay in business they started

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,530
their own publishing company and tried

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,450
to do the same thing that Loki did well

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,560
license games will port them to linux

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,240
and then we'll sell them through our

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,600
retail outlet tubs games among other

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,820
places and they have kind of vanished

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,410
they're sort of still around but their

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,030
server is not responding but allegedly

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,170
they're still in business to other

00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,940
people to other companies up there

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,530
Hyperion entertainment did a couple of

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,300
really good Linux games like show go mad

00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,220
and some other things and then they

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,260
decide it was more profitable to port to

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,709
the Amiga I'm not making this up as

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,850
actually happened

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:09,369
they are actually now in the business of

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,379
designing amiga OS version 4 to run on

00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:13,179
more modern hardware than an amiga but

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,769
and then there was also trips off and

00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:17,379
there's a few others i'm ignoring here

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,100
which did jagged alliance a linux port

00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,499
of that and they went out of business

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,209
and the guy that was running that now

00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,829
works for Crytek or used to last time I

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,410
ran into him and then of course there's

00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:30,759
this guy that's me trying to get the air

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,049
conditioner to work it low-key no way

00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,989
you don't like my rain dance and only

00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:38,019
open um anyway gosh oh so attractive

00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:39,160
back then okay anyway but of all those

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,689
companies they all went out of business

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,629
or they all went on did other things and

00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:45,549
I refuse to get a real job so I went and

00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:46,959
I moved in with my parents and I worked

00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,730
at a worked a cash register for a while

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,809
and I got really really bored with that

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,829
so I made a cold call to Croatia because

00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,600
there's a company out there called crow

00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,970
team that made a game called serious sam

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,579
who's played that I love that game it's

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,470
like doom but better you know anyway so

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,299
here let's pump out the 90s here for a

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,619
moment so I did serious sam i just

00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:07,209
called them out of the blue and said

00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,470
here's a really passionate argument

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,089
about why you should do a linux version

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,410
this game blahdy blahdy blahdy you can

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,569
get you the PlayStation 2 because it's

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,559
the same compiler and blah blah blah and

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:16,269
the guy wrote back to me he's like I'm

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,709
just an artist man that's the only email

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,699
i could find so he forward me to the

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,470
business people and they said yeah let's

00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:22,089
do it so i did it and that caught some

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,559
attention and Daniel Vogel who I

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,269
mentioned before who sent the angry

00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,619
email was now working at epic and he

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,319
said we need a Linux dedicated server

00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:31,480
for this game unreal tournament 2003 and

00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,160
so he called me up because he knew i was

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,169
you know desperate for money and said

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,720
hey you know have a mediocre work ethic

00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:39,100
so we can probably make this work so I

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,089
went out there I did links communicated

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,910
server and they said hey can you also

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,350
get the the game client running too so

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,509
he could play the game on leg step just

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,540
hosting servers for it and I said what

00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,949
could possibly go wrong so jokes aside

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,509
it actually worked we shipped it it was

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,619
literally on the retail CDs if you

00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,769
bought the windows version of that game

00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,959
there was a Linux installer on it too so

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,279
it was a huge wild success in a totally

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,769
dead market where everyone had given up

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,379
after low-key games and then you know

00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:10,119
Sweden called and I did battlefield 1942

00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:12,069
and that was hilarity ensued but but

00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:14,259
once those three things were done and I

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,490
don't have a slide for this other people

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,080
started calling they said hey I'm a

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,910
unreal licensee and I would

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,350
so like a server and can you do the

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,670
client while you're there too and that

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,260
lots of working from that and then

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,120
people started calling me and say hey we

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,370
weren't in this Linux thing so for the

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,580
next 10 years we kind of limped along

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:33,820
this way with me kind of trying to port

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:36,100
as many things as I could and I did the

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,140
best I could I have CDs on my wall for

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,020
each game I've shipped I ran out of room

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,370
after 50 of these it's probably closer

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,800
to 75 now I don't know I've lost track

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,720
so that that that's not successful you

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,220
think about even if it was 75 I don't

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,650
know what the exact number is but over

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,440
the course of 10 years that's not very

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,970
many games but you know I'm only one

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,210
person but then some other things

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,209
happened look at that we just did a

00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,650
whole decade that was really fast okay

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,690
this game came out has anyone ever

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,550
played this is called aquaria this is

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,900
good if you like like the Metroid type

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,330
game the Castlevania Symphony of the

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,339
Night type game take that and put it

00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:18,490
under the ocean your character swims

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,640
around she's a mermaid thing but it's a

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,990
good game had an interesting story

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,300
delivered on a pretty big open world it

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,280
was it was pretty fun I say this because

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,360
some guy randomly emailed me and said I

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,000
would really like to get this game on

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,890
Linux can you talk to the people who did

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,450
it and I said yeah I guess whatever

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,460
they're going to write back to me but it

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,010
turns out it's two guys in canada alex

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,090
holika and derek you and I said hey I

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,440
think this would be interested do and

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,990
they said cool let's do it so we did it

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,520
ported it no problem I also did this

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,350
this is I'm not going to get into a

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,940
whole list of games here but these are

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,920
important for a specific reason I also

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,600
did this game lougarou or loup-garou I'm

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,070
not really sure how to pronounce it this

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,690
is the danger of doing business over

00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,550
email as anyone play this game okay a

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,400
couple of hands I'll summarize it for

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,010
you like this take rabbits make them

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,290
humanoid and have them do kung fu on

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,140
each other

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,290
as ridiculous as it sounds this game is

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,610
an enormous amount of fun this game was

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,560
written by a guy named David Rosen

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,420
working for a company called wool fire

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,610
which is his own company its wool fires

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,040
like David's apartment you know it's

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,070
like that's where it is he wrote this I

00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,480
think when he was in high school or just

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,740
leaving high school like he was very

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,500
very young when he wrote this did the

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,910
art and the graphics and the code

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,270
everything was done by David it was just

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:40,000
a one person job now I got a call from a

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,410
guy named John Graham who you might know

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,510
from a company called humble bundle and

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,040
at the time he wrote to me from a wool

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,900
fire com email address the guys who did

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,090
Luke the garou and he said we have this

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,830
idea and we want to take a couple of

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,120
games that we've made and our friends

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,430
have made and we want to put them in a

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,050
bundle together and sell them like you

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,480
pay whatever you want we give a piece of

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:04,270
it to charity we want them all to run on

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,470
mac linux and windows and if you won't

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,690
pay a penny for it that's cool no

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,750
problem whatever and we'll give some to

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,610
charity and you know just as a side note

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,260
we would like to if we make a million

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:18,190
dollars on this release the source code

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,230
to these games okay no problem and I

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,030
send they had at the time was the ones

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:26,470
they were thinking of were was lougarou

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:29,140
this the bunny murder simulator penumbra

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,490
penumbra overture which is a survival

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,190
horror game if you haven't been scared

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,010
recently you should try it and world of

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,760
goo and yesh was the other one I don't

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,340
know I'm not going to get into the

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,750
details of these games but and I wrote

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,530
to my was like well you know I just

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,300
finish this game called aquaria and it's

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,250
it's it's an indie game like the rest of

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,420
it fits that same spirit and its really

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,500
really good and I think maybe you

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,210
probably make a little more money if you

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,740
through one more person in there and I

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,790
was like and this is exact quote and I

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,020
don't have it on slide but it was

00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,240
something like you know in this game

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,400
braid just finished its exclusive on

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,780
xbox live arcade you should put your

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,320
dick on the table and see if John blow

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,550
chops it off so they call Jonathan Blow

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,080
the guy who wrote braid if you haven't

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,270
played braid it was this wild indie

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,820
success and it's an incredibly great

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,230
game it's mind-blowing I would recommend

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,750
you try it's on sale right now during

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,820
the steam summer sale but

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,060
and they did they called John blow and

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,380
he chopped it off unfortunately so but

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,700
they went with every other game they got

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,960
a query in there I don't know if you can

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,850
see all these icons got your world of

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,890
goo and your aquaria and your Gish and

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,930
your loup-garou HD and penumbra overture

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,120
and this game showed up to and I'll tell

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,590
you why this is the humble indie bundle

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,730
they called it this is the first one

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,990
there was no number after because they

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,360
didn't know there would be a second at

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,100
the time they also put some charities in

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,200
there they put the electronic frontier

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,460
foundation so every portion of your

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,600
purchase which you could dictate you can

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,670
say I'm going to give you a dollar if

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,440
your jerk if you put less than a dollar

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,790
they popped up a picture of a homeless

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,590
guy saying we'll make indie games for

00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,700
food just did you know you can still

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,810
give them less but you had to look at

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,310
that guy if you were going to do it but

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,900
but there were sliders you can say i

00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,520
want this particular game to get most of

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,260
my money and this game to get a little

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,370
less and they're also to charities and

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,540
you could there were sliders for those

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,980
you could say i'm going to give you a

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,480
hundred dollars but i want all to go to

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,770
the eff now give me the games and that

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,250
was okay that was part of the deal you

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,600
could do that so it was the eff there

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,460
are two cherries it was the eff and

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,460
child's play no wait child's play

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,960
child's play for those that haven't

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,540
heard of this the penny arcade guys did

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,980
this the comic strip guys and it's a big

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,210
charity they make a lot they bring in a

00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,860
lot of money rear and what they dump

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,300
that money into is bringing game

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,310
consoles and video games to sick

00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,320
children in hospitals which is like I

00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,610
like if you could like rescue puppies

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,590
from something that would make it like

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,960
the most heart yeah warming charity ever

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,280
so it's not for medical research not for

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,280
anything of that it's just to make a

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,690
sick kids day suck a little less so it

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,950
was it was a good cherien you know if

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,140
you thought that was a waste of your

00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,270
money and you thought that these guys

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,490
were you know much better you could say

00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,440
i want i can dictate exactly where my

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,720
funds will go for this so everyone had a

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,270
really good feeling about this now what

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,710
these people told me this is a direct

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,540
quote from the email that John sent me

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,860
when they first pitch this idea to me

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,690
when I told him to put a query in there

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,130
too he said the kicker is that if the

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,630
deal reaches a million dollars of total

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,340
donations the source code all the games

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,050
will become available and that's what

00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,410
the wool fire crew said to me and my

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,400
inner monologue said whatever you say

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,410
because I was like okay sure you know

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,580
you're like you make twenty thousand

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,050
dollars off of this and it'll be like

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,610
incredible because you know you're all

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,710
making video games and eating ramen

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,910
noodles to survive so that's going to be

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,680
a lot of money and you're going to just

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,880
give this going to be just mind-blowing

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,980
when you make ten thousand dollars

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,360
twenty thousand dollars so at the end of

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,440
the promotion a week later and we were

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:49,430
sitting on 1.2 million dollars nobody

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,110
knew what to do with this holy but

00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,670
they did open source those games aquaria

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,500
was released under the GPL well they

00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,870
open source muslim we get the slide back

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,130
here okay a query went under the GPL ish

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,380
i think went under the GPL Luke

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,670
loup-garou went under the GPL and while

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,450
I have the slide up here you'll see this

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,500
guy all the way over here samorost to

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,060
donated that game for free when you saw

00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,350
how much money was coming in he said I

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,730
just want to make sure some more money's

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,080
coming into this thing this is the big

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,120
deal for indie people it's a big deal

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,680
for charity I don't know I'm maybe they

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,540
cut him a check but as far as I'm

00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,770
understanding the agreement was he just

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,150
gave it away for free you just said I

00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,770
just want to make this thing a little

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,660
better so that more money comes in for

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,790
all the people that deserve it which is

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:30,890
an incredible act of honest-to-god

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:32,870
charity okay so how do we do overall

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,320
with the Humble Bundle 11.2 I'm gonna

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:39,310
read the whole number off to 127

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,710
1 million 273,000 some dollars that

00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,900
broke down to about 166,000 dollars for

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,490
each game now remember one of those

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,530
games written by a guy in high school by

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,520
himself not a bad little paycheck for a

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,670
game he had written a couple years ago

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,530
to might i add 183 thousand dollars the

00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,950
Electronic Frontier Foundation not a bad

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,540
day for freedom and 188 thousand dollars

00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,800
for child's play not a bad day for sick

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,280
kids except unfortunately they're still

00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,810
sick people said this was a flash in the

00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:13,030
pan it would not happen if you did it

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:14,950
twice the first one made 1.2 million

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:19,240
dollars the next meet 1.8 the one after

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,680
that made 2.6 2.16 then 2.37 and then

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,210
the fifth one which was particularly a

00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,210
good bundle I mean like as far as like

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,630
fine wines go it was a good bundle 5.1

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,790
million dollars in one week not too

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,070
shabby and they did some other things

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,450
they started putting you know some bonus

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,830
games in there like if you know if you

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,570
beat the average they would throw a cup

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,190
of everyone that contributed thus far

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,470
they would throw an extra game in for

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,390
you and stuff like that so they became

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,800
very good the psychology of it and one

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,410
of the things they did that was very

00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,670
very important was they put a little pie

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,840
chart on there if anyone's ever been to

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,900
Humble Bundle you've seen this pie chart

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,040
it tells you exactly what platform

00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:59,320
people are buying these games for and

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,420
how much they spent and I say this for a

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,000
reason because linux people every bundle

00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,050
that has ever been on the humble in the

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
Humble Bundle I don't know if this is

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,580
true I haven't followed the last ten of

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,410
these or so but universally almost if

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,420
not completely universally the Linux

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,160
people have given more money than any

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,930
other platform including the Mac people

00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,700
now there's less of them let's be fair

00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,740
there's a it's just a smaller market

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,790
there's more people with macs

00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,200
theoretically than have linux there's

00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,540
definitely more people that

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,730
theoretically that have windows than

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,200
Linux but so we understand it's a

00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,690
smaller market there were less linux

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,290
users giving money like in terms of like

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,850
warm bodies but there was more linux

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,440
users giving more there's linux users

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,570
you were giving more money per person

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,490
and this is a round number it's not

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,080
exactly twenty five percent but for a

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,420
long time and possibly still the humble

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,149
bundles income is their their revenue is

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,229
twenty-five percent Linux users

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:52,239
now the reason the way they tell you

00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:53,739
this is when you buy the game they look

00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:55,059
at what web browser you have if it

00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:56,769
reports you're on Linux they say your

00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:58,059
linux user and there's a little check

00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:59,679
box so you can change if they got it

00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:03,249
wrong or if you want also give a shout

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:07,379
out to Mac OS or something like that for

00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:09,549
whatever reason but but you could see

00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:11,139
dollar for dollar like okay the Mac

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:13,029
people are giving five dollars on

00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:14,979
average for all the mac users and the

00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,570
lynch people are giving eight dollars

00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:18,909
nine dollars it was not just a couple

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,049
pennies more it was quite a bit more did

00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,249
they have something to prove I don't

00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,809
know I don't know what the psychology of

00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:26,049
it is I think it's probably a market

00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:27,820
that's less saturated with anyone

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:31,450
can get a thousand clones of flappy bird

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,809
on windows or diablo 3 or whatever your

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,299
favorite clone is but a good quality

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,009
honest to god earnestly made game harder

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,570
to come by on linux and the linux users

00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:43,299
came out and rewarded them heavily for

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,470
it and still do and i don't have a slide

00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,479
for this i don't have the exact number

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,919
but they've done bundles that were steam

00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:51,429
only before there was a steam on linux

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,559
and windows only for example the humble

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:56,499
THQ bundle which was like saints row and

00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,440
other windows only titles and the linux

00:26:56,499 --> 00:27:01,059
users still represented so i don't know

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,349
what to tell you about that the point is

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:03,580
that there are linux users out there and

00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:07,509
they have money and they want to spend

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,129
it on games and I've stuck my fingers

00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:11,679
down my throat so many times listening

00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:13,599
to people say oh there's no money in the

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,979
linux industry there's no money in linux

00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,499
games why would you ever support those

00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:19,450
people and you know it's like the linux

00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:22,389
people are like well you know maybe you

00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:25,659
should pay attention to the numbers then

00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:27,489
this happened for those that don't

00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,320
recognize this that's the heavy that's a

00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:31,809
character class from Team Fortress 2 a

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,549
game by valve the thing is holding might

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:37,359
be a turret from Portal I'm not sure

00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:39,450
what that is exactly oh it's a sin oh it

00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,950
is a sandwich I never noticed that okay

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,239
there's a long running joke in tf2 about

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,609
the sandwich tits I'm not going to get

00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:47,139
into it but for those of you that don't

00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:49,509
remember your history this is what the

00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:51,700
ipod ads looked like back when we were

00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:54,279
talking my ipods instead of iphones it

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,409
was always like this neon background and

00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,119
a black silhouette of a dancer dancing

00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,009
with what was clearly a white ipod and

00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,630
headphones on and there were really cool

00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:03,610
commercials they're really you know

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,750
earth-shattering in terms of marketing

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,640
at the time and they're very very

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,710
recognizable so valve started posting

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,950
pictures of characters from their games

00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,030
in Mac advertisements the other one I

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,060
don't have the picture here but a

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,710
picture of the portal to turret and some

00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,360
busted ass looking old turret from like

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,960
Team Fortress 2 and once it I'm a Mac

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:27,010
I'm a PC we've all seen that commercial

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,270
too so this happens steam for steam for

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,040
mac OS happened I know you're like what

00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,920
this is a linux talk why you talking

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,160
about mac OS the people who did the mac

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,480
OS port at valve and they had called me

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,770
up and i just bought a house and I come

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,480
moved to Seattle and work for us sounds

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,240
like I just bought a house in Charlotte

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,440
a bit of a commute but I came in I

00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,060
helped them with some things than they

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,760
did most of the work of course but they

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,170
shipped steam for mac OS and what they

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,010
wanted to do was look at that and they

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,440
wanted to look at the numbers from

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,930
Humble Bundle and say because the people

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,510
who did the mac version between you and

00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:59,830
me they were linux users but they also

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,750
knew how to pick their battles they said

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,190
we can do a mac version of this where

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,540
people believe there's money so there

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,390
will be no resist there'll be less

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,180
resistance to doing this inside valve

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:13,030
itself now legend has it that there is

00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:15,220
somewhere on a shelf in valve a complete

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:18,150
gold master of half-life 1 for mac OS 9

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,110
it was done all it had to do was go to

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,000
reproduction and it would be for sale

00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,410
and they said yeah we don't want to do

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,800
it I don't know if that's true I've

00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:30,400
heard that's true it's believable enough

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,870
if if it isn't true but so there was

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,220
some concern that Valve would push back

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,420
and say we won't don't lend to a mac

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,700
version we don't lend to a mac version

00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,960
but they said okay they pushed hard

00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,220
enough they said okay there's definitely

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,900
a market now because the ipod's have

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,210
gotten really popular and there's this

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,980
whole switcher campaign for from apple

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,630
for the max and you know it seems like

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,710
their numbers are increasing and my god

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,720
they can pay for a three-thousand-dollar

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:53,410
laptop they can probably buy a couple of

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,600
five dollar games off steam so they ship

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,980
this thing and their numbers were I mean

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,790
you know the mac version is never ever

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,010
going to beat the Windows version

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,870
there's not enough warm bodies but they

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,880
saw enough return on investment from

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,590
that to say okay this was a good idea

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,590
and then those people that did the Mac

00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,230
were just said

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:15,870
let's do the Linux version of it so then

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:17,520
this happened and let's see steam for

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,440
Linux shipped they announced it ahead of

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,120
time oh weird my slide go I had one here

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,330
they put out a blog post called steamed

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,230
steamed penguins talking about how we're

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,640
going to do this we're gonna ship a

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,080
Linux client we're going to do left 4

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,460
dead 2 we're going to a port of that and

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,700
we'll see what happens from there and

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,340
the world went nuts slashdot went nuts

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,110
read it went nuts everyone went nuts so

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,940
they shipped it steam for Linux full

00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,320
support for Steamworks features steam

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,360
play which is to say you buy the game

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,220
once on whatever platform you want and

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,110
it's available on every platform that

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,460
the game ships on so if you bought the

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,779
Windows version of it but they're also

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,520
happens to be a Linux part of this game

00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,799
on Steam you get it for free you don't

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,720
have to buy / platform which was always

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,820
kind of a roadblock if you go back to

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,350
the low key days in the low key days we

00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,710
had so much trouble from people saying

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:03,480
hey we already bought this game a month

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,070
ago on Windows and now you want me to

00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,720
pay full price for the Linux version and

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,539
there was never a really good answer to

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,070
this and Loki had a great problem it was

00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,210
called retail distribution now when

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,490
you're shipping your games over an

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,779
ethernet wire that problem goes away and

00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,520
you don't have to sell your game for

00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,750
sixty dollars and you can if the main

00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,870
developer is getting at all because it's

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:24,029
all done by the same company it's not

00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,559
really a problem so steam play solved a

00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:27,390
lot of problems if you bought the game

00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,799
and it happened to be on linux and mac

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,919
in addition to windows you got on all

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,210
three platforms one price it was great

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,860
which also was a benefit to people there

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,510
were heavy steam users before that when

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,620
the linux version ship congratulations

00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,220
you already have 100 games in your

00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,110
library alright you know as a so as it

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,760
stands right now as of last week when i

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,340
check this number a couple of weeks ago

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,140
we just passed the 500 games on linux

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,419
mark you can buy 500 separate

00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,539
honest-to-god linux games on steam and

00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,679
play them immediately the estimate is

00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,090
there will be seven hundred by the end

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,919
of the year we have a little less than

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,409
six months to make that happen but um

00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,460
and that seems like you know of course

00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:04,140
there's gonna be a wave of people that

00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,580
already had linux versions for example

00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,250
all those humble bundle games like

00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,390
loup-garou and Aquarian stuff those are

00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,679
all up there because we already had

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,000
those Linux versions but people have to

00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,340
start from scratch once you get that

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,419
initial wave of people that had no

00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,500
barrier to entry they already had a

00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:22,500
Linux port but then this happened

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,670
anyone heard of this steamos valve is

00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,620
shipping their own linux distribution

00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,470
and what they want to do is compete with

00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,740
game consoles which is crazy gravy that

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,860
is a nuts idea the modern philosophy has

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,510
always been you cannot compete with

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,710
Nintendo and Sony and then Microsoft

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,640
showed up is like okay you can compete

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,690
with them if you have billions of

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,880
dollars but then huye showed up and then

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,850
android console showed up and then one

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,170
off tablets for android and etc etc like

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,340
that and then we started realize that

00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:54,150
you know you can actually do a micro

00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,940
console you don't have to compete at the

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,920
xbox 360 level the xbox one level or the

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,220
playstation 4 level you can do something

00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,480
smaller but steam is taking a slightly

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,010
different approach that was taking a

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,590
different approach with steamos it's a

00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,960
Linux kernel it's based on debian the

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,640
the user space is based on debian and

00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,840
then they built their own tech on top of

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,450
that to give you kind of that like

00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,490
console e you play the game controller

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,870
and there's a nice user interface for

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,700
selecting your games and downloading

00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,950
them but they did it more like the

00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,390
Android model and this they have betas

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,890
shipping of this the actual final things

00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:31,770
are not shipping for a little while yet

00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:32,910
but they um I forgot was going to say I

00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,040
hate when that happens when I'm on stage

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,470
in front of all these people they did it

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,790
more like the Android model where the

00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,710
Google said here's Android here's the

00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,410
source code to it do whatever you want

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,510
and instead of having like like Apple

00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,770
has where you have one iphone or a

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,870
couple of different models of iPhones

00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,580
you have the Android model where you can

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,170
have millions of different phones and

00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,580
they all have roughly the same base and

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,660
that brings some different problems as

00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,880
anyone's ever used an android phone

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,640
understands but you you have this

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,750
democratization of hardware and valve is

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,010
gonna do the same thing fell is not

00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,900
going to ship a console or if they do

00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,550
they'll ship just kind of like a like

00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,220
this is roughly our idea of a console

00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,600
what they want other people do they want

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,760
computer makers PC makers to ship their

00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,929
own consoles and say it's a steam OS box

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,090
the same way you might say this is an

00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,590
android phone whereas this is an Android

00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:20,190
phone doesn't tell you that much about

00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,840
the phone by itself and in that case you

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,429
don't have to compete to have the lowest

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,340
price hardware made by the lowest

00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:28,260
bidders you don't have to fight against

00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,350
Microsoft to have cheaper hardware made

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,950
by made in batches of a million and Sony

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,839
for that matter

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,190
and you don't have to have a hardware

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,899
design at all you said say it looks like

00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:41,159
a pc that runs linux more or less and

00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:43,619
then you can have people that want to

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,230
have you know the top shelf good

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,399
champagne you know Apple model wears

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,440
like I'm going to pay top dollar to get

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,909
the best highest powered console I can

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,079
the best video card and the best

00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,310
whatever and you can also have the

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,379
people are now at the ueo level where

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,300
it's like I paint $75 for this it has

00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:59,099
kind of not the best video chip in it

00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,849
but it plays the casual game my mom

00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:04,859
wants to play you know so that in itself

00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,700
is interesting but I got to tell you a

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:09,420
story about Jonathan Blow real quick I

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,820
said the thing about Humble Bundle

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,380
before and you know if you know the

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,910
history of humble bundle humble bundle

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,200
one did not have braids in it they

00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,430
called him they asked and he said I

00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,990
don't think so this seems like a silly

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,190
idea I don't know exactly what he said

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,700
he was probably more polite than that

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:27,060
but we hit 1.2 million dollars and the

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,440
phone starts ringing you'll note that

00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,940
braid is in the second humble indie

00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,190
bundle but also people started calling

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,510
me because they'd be like I want to get

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,800
into the next bundle you guys do because

00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,869
i want to chunk i want to slice of that

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,790
pie i want that 1.2 million dollars or

00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,980
whatever I want my piece of that and

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,829
they said well that's cool you have an

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:48,089
export no he can't be in the bundle then

00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:49,800
and rules have loosened since then of

00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,810
course but at the time he was like no

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,550
linux port no deal we got lots of other

00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,380
games we can put in here so people I've

00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,880
never heard of started calling me I mean

00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,140
like I need to get my game cord to linux

00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,490
as fast as possible because i want to go

00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,430
back and present this to the humble

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,530
bundle guys get into the next bundle we

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,210
had poured it I had ported braid so they

00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,950
and that's why I suggested for the first

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,359
bundle and then Jonathan Blow said hey

00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,980
maybe this is something I should be

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,690
experimenting with and Lord knows at

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,280
this point bundles are the way that

00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,210
we're selling stuff now it's not just

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,790
the humble indie bundle there's a

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,520
million knockoffs and there's there's

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:23,579
bundles for story for for e-books and

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,349
audiobooks and comic books and music and

00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,790
blah blah blah and other videogame ones

00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,490
and stuff so it was an idea whose time

00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,660
had come but the reason I say this to

00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,420
you is that there are lots of people

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,609
that would not have taken a phone call

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,530
from me and other Linux porting type

00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:39,570
people that

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,220
as soon as steamos was announced and

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,600
valve put their money in their weight

00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,400
behind it suddenly my phone starts

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,200
ringing again and its triple-a titles

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,280
all right there's a new console and we

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,110
want to get in there because it's

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,520
getting so much press and valve did

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,300
steam dev days which is a conference

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,920
much like this and that just got

00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,450
everyone's excitement even higher for it

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,770
so now we have all these games that are

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,780
coming in there and so I had said you

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,790
know can we get to 700 games by the end

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,160
of the year well there's been I think

00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:08,010
steam is to now or it's about to be two

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,810
on Linux there's people that have been

00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,400
working on porting games for a long time

00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,220
so there's probably going to be another

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,020
wave of games flooding in now and then

00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,860
eventually in a perfect world will get

00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,780
to the point where people are just

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,160
developing for linux from the start the

00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,730
same way they developed for windows it

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,930
may be a console or whatnot so so 700

00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,880
eames by the year is totally possible

00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:29,270
and that number only goes up from there

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,490
so that's good news for linux people oh

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,630
and then this happened there's something

00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,690
called Unreal Engine I mentioned Tim

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:40,230
Sweeney earlier i ran into tim at a

00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:43,050
party sounds like a bad start to a joke

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:46,380
but no I I ran into him at the opening

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,610
of epics offices in Seattle and I said

00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,230
Tim it's been many years since I've seen

00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,790
you he used to jokingly introduce me to

00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,900
people as the Linux game industry hey

00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:56,190
this is ryan he's the linux game

00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:58,230
industry so having not seen him for many

00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,090
years and having had a really bad time

00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,890
with Underland with unreal tournament 3

00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,620
which probably caused him no end of

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,420
agony i run into this party because hey

00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,970
it's the Linux gamer industry oh

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,320
okay so I said pay Tim what you doing

00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,460
and he's like oh I'm not doing so much

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
technical stuff now I'm running the

00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,600
business I'm doing more business stuff

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,790
for epic games now and I said Tim that's

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,870
a waste of your talent which is a really

00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,030
rude thing to say I shouldn't have said

00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,350
it just came out of my mouth but he's a

00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,450
brilliant engineer and I was surprised

00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,340
that he was going to do business suit

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,230
stuff he was going to deal with

00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,280
navigating the business there's lots of

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,340
business people there i could do that

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,650
for him and and I he was polite about

00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,390
he's a very kind person but I was prob I

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,350
probably insulted him but having watched

00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,970
would happen in the next few months

00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:41,580
after that party you know what I was

00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:44,700
 wrong Unreal Engine is now an

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:46,890
open source project sort of triple-a

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,150
engine this is the best games in the

00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,410
world the most technically advanced

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,220
games in the world those are not the

00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,690
same thing

00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,010
but the most technologically advanced

00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,840
games in the world are being built on

00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,440
this right now and they said here's what

00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,030
we do nineteen dollars you get a copy of

00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,140
the engine source code every piece of it

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:05,490
it's literally on github and you pay

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,320
them your 19 hours and they give you

00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:10,440
access to the Unreal Engine account on

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,150
github and you can clone from there you

00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,619
pay them ninety dollars a month and when

00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,390
you ship five dot five percent of your

00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,640
revenue which might be a lot might be if

00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,710
you're doing a zero price game you pay

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,940
them nothing except for your $19 if you

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,230
stop paying them you get to keep

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,099
whatever code drop you have you don't

00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,450
have to pay them nice and dollars a

00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,540
month forever so if you decide you've

00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:30,330
got good enough code you just stop it's

00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,470
on github I mentioned that they when

00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,430
they announce this deal where they're

00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,680
going to give the source code out to

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,250
anyone who wants it without any prior

00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,599
credential check or making sure whatever

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,070
they said at the time they did this at

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,930
GDC game developer conference this year

00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,760
and in their private rooms they were

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,500
showing the engine running on steamos

00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,770
which that is to say they should run on

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,349
Linux the day they announced it and by

00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:55,080
version 4.1 that is a month after the

00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,580
thing for a ship full Linux support in

00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,730
the engine shipping to everyone that has

00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,589
access to their github account the

00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,359
editor for unreal has been a contentious

00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:04,950
item for over a decade now because we

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,470
kept promising it and for Unreal Engine

00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,300
3 they switched over to WX widgets for

00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,400
their GUI tool kits so we could get a

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,869
Linux and Mac part of it and it never

00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,580
happened for a lot of reasons which

00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,410
aren't worth getting into but we had

00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,910
promised it we promised it we promised

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,670
it and when I say we I mean me and epic

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,560
we're not the same people of course but

00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:26,490
but finally with the source code on

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,160
github for Unreal Engine 4

00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:31,380
about a month after it shipped rabid

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,630
linux users in IRC channel got the

00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,480
 editor running on linux natively

00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,740
100% talking to x 11 in the month after

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,470
that we've got talking one hundred

00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,930
percent to sdl so that when you switch

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,910
your display server from x11 to mirror

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,170
or Wayland it's just going to work

00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:50,490
you're not even have to recompile it

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:52,050
it's a good deal this is historic

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,150
history in the making and this is a

00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,590
historic event specifically having that

00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,810
editor running because this is the first

00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,980
time with the Unreal Engine and that is

00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,540
to say with the tools that maybe

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,070
possibly we're all going to be using

00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,990
this is the first time not only can you

00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,880
run a game on Linux that's unreal based

00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,910
you can make a game on Linux that's

00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,500
unreal based which is remarkable and I

00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,030
can't wait to see what happens with that

00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,619
because there's other things that make

00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,900
linux games like unity which is

00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,940
incredibly good too but there is no

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,950
unity tools on linux you build it on

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,960
windows or I think Mac OS and you hit

00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,280
the port to linux button I'm not kidding

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,930
i'm pretty sure it's a one-click thing

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,400
to do it that's good but you can't you

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,610
still need a windows box or a mac to

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,369
built to design and construct your game

00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:33,840
in the first place so this is this is

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,890
going to be a big thing in the future

00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,359
and i think it's going to push other

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,490
people because you could see immediately

00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,350
Crytek in unity boosted oh yeah we have

00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,670
similar projects plans coming for our

00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,680
thing the second epic announced this

00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,540
because this is this is not done in the

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,890
game industry this is really a sea

00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,350
change and I'm pretty sure this was

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:53,070
Tim's idea so I was wrong to tell him he

00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:54,690
was a bad businessman all right i'm at

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,540
the end of my talk here i have two more

00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,869
slides usually I have a lot more points

00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,869
on here

00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,270
what you can do you want to be part of

00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:07,390
this do you want to help the cause do

00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,980
you want to have an effort on the future

00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,240
usually it's like x linux games don't

00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,070
buy things on windows if there's no

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,590
linux port blah blah blah all that

00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,940
make a game the tools are out there now

00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,440
there are tools out there that are

00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,970
incredibly good to use that you can use

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,740
on Linux without any programming

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,910
experience now programming experience

00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,550
always helps I don't mean to minimize

00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,590
that I'm a programmer myself but we're

00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,330
at the point where if you're you think

00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,220
yourself more of an artist or you think

00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,940
yourself more is like someone animates

00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,560
stick figures that would be me i guess

00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,860
you can still build a game and the thing

00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:40,150
is what I've learned is that quote hey

00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,730
there's that business guy again I made

00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,440
fun of I think we're heading towards a

00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,890
future where triple-a is the minority

00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,630
said Tim Sweeney about a month ago he

00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,920
thinks the next generation of games are

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,420
going to be made by indie people which

00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,540
has always been true remember that slide

00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,950
for doom that was four guys in a garage

00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,020
now granted they got big from there and

00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,290
epic was very much in a similar

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,580
situation but we're at the point where

00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:05,230
people aren't making small games so they

00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,360
can get big they're making small games

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,620
because they mean something and it's

00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,510
something they're passionate about and

00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,520
something they love and we're at the

00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,620
point where now we have distributions

00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,630
and we have distribution channels like

00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:19,570
Steam and disorder and other things like

00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,980
that and we have resources where you

00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,540
don't need a million dollars to get a

00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,820
powerful engine or a million dollars

00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,080
just to get anything at all or a team of

00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,150
people together the tools are much

00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,920
better than they used to be you can go

00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,600
out and make a game that means something

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,400
to you that tells your personal story

00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,380
and we're starting to see this we're

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,120
starting to see things like braid which

00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,480
had something personal to say and things

00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,890
like pop-pop o'yea which is a game about

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,200
purse the game developer wrote a game

00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,500
about his alcoholic father and it's

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,270
awesome and terrifying

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,530
but we're at the point where you can

00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,570
have that voice and not worry about what

00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,580
Nintendo will say or Sony will say so

00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,950
what'd i say to you go and make a game

00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,640
it's time to do it and make it for linux

00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:09,300
but make a game anyway that's my talk

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:10,500
thank you very much I think I have two

00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,820
minutes for questions but we

00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,930
around with the macbook for 10 minutes

00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,830
so i don't know i'm going to take

00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,750
questions so they kicked me off the

00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:20,640
stage you had your hand up for like an

00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:24,930
hour i'm sorry i was not involved with

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:29,640
the civ 5 port aspire I think that's

00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:30,840
pronounced but a spire I don't know that

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,250
this is actually a good point because

00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,230
the other thing that just shipped was

00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,850
xcom enemy unknown done by feral

00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,080
interactive if you don't know feral

00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,080
interactive it's because they only do

00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,430
one thing they ship mac games now look

00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,010
at that their ship in linux games now

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,300
figure that one out it's a good game you

00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:50,720
should get it it's a real native linux

00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,720
port to you in the back

00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,580
well I have a whole talk about that he

00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,500
asked what tools you would use to make

00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,390
games and Linux if you wait another

00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,040
month I would seriously recommend unreal

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,510
I think it's they have a system in there

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,040
called blueprints which is phenomenal

00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,680
and you can build a whole lot of game

00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,860
without a lot of code it's it's kind of

00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,030
game-changing if you can forgive the pun

00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,200
unity is really really good if you want

00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,600
to hit the ground running like I said

00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,540
you can't use it on Linux but lots of

00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:20,570
really good Linux games like gone home

00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,220
for example and rashard and numbers of

00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,740
other things have shipped for Linux by

00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,210
people that literally don't have linux

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,010
installed they don't know any they're

00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,060
not linux experts so those would be the

00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:32,270
two tools that would take now if you

00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,720
want make something big and easy one

00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,720
second yes

00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,350
ok

00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,350
please

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,000
okay what he asked is he said there's

00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,230
there's a rash of linux games coming in

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,450
which she said that like that was a bad

00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,830
thing I'll forgive you for it but he

00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:02,420
said that almost every game the ships

00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,000
for Linux has really bad multi-monitor

00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,160
support there's two things that I can

00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,790
recommend 1x11 is a steaming pile of

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,320
 you know this because there's two

00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,590
competing projects to replace it and

00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,120
everyone's angry about that but

00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:19,340
multi-monitor and x11 will never work

00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:24,230
well it works okay until you need to do

00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:26,180
something useful with it and we've spent

00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,450
a lot of time working around it but what

00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,860
I would tell people to do is use use sdl

00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,480
if you're using the lowest level and if

00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,090
your engine I don't know what unity use

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,500
this item unreal uses sdl I don't know

00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,060
what unity uses but if your engine is

00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,890
not using it you should be using sdl too

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,360
and they have something in there called

00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,460
full screen desktop mode which basically

00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,140
says just give me the resolution of the

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,850
monitor I don't don't screw around with

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,560
trying to get to like a 640 by 480

00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,150
context or something just give me

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,430
whatever the monitor is at right now and

00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,290
do the right thing and it can specify

00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,760
one on this monitor this modern and

00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,620
enumerate what monitors are out there

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,790
most people do it wrong it's not hard to

00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,230
do it right but the first step is you

00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,270
have to be using sdl because we spent

00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,010
literally hundreds of man-hours trying

00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,390
to make that work right and sometimes it

00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,040
still doesn't because the only thing

00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,110
that's worse the next 11 is x11 window

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,940
managers they all do it slightly

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,940
differently yes

00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:27,579
how good is the OpenGL documentation

00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:29,920
very good if you speak martian it's very

00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:31,510
very heavily and well documented but it

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,460
uses a lot of things that are incredibly

00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,170
frustrating for example a lot of how you

00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,060
get to useful features in OpenGL are

00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,579
through extensions you say hey does this

00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,560
video card support some magical thing

00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,790
that OpenGL by default doesn't and you

00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,290
say oh it does that's cool the

00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,910
documentation for those does the most

00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,290
obnoxious thing in the world for every

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,390
extension this is the format they use

00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,520
they say take the OpenGL specification

00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,880
which is hundreds of pages and on page

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,410
42 replace this paragraph with this one

00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,030
holy so like you said they're

00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,220
trying to figure out usually you can

00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:02,020
piece it together just based on the

00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,220
extension documentation but when you're

00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,690
trying to kind of parse like well they

00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,790
say that but does it interfere with this

00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,720
i don't know i mean it that is really

00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,800
frustrating the other thing it's

00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,079
incredibly frustrating about OpenGL

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,760
documentation is that the documentation

00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:16,839
all the functions in OpenGL start with

00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,130
the letters G&L lowercase G L well

00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:19,420
there's no wonder well yeah underscore

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,760
for like an enumeration is but the

00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:25,540
functions are like GL begin or whatever

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,700
they don't use that call ever but the

00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,319
documentation does not put that GL on

00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,680
the front of it so now you're googling

00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:35,020
for the word begin it's going to go well

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,520
it's going to go well and that's stupid

00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,430
it's anachronistic and that's what they

00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,810
did the initial documentation the format

00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:44,260
they took for it was probably written

00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,940
before Google existed at SGI and it

00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,369
never changed because you know you build

00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,690
a culture and the culture resist change

00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:51,339
it doesn't matter whether it's open jail

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,079
or any other culture of any kind on the

00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:55,900
planet and that's just an unfortunate

00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:57,280
thing and it's caused problems there are

00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,750
lots and lots of really good books

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,060
written about OpenGL but it's really

00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,050
really easy to drown in them sometimes

00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,250
all you want to do is get some to

00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,770
the screen right you don't want to get

00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,359
into all the fancy stuff and then

00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,369
there's backwards compatibility OpenGL

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,869
is spent a lot of time doing things that

00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:14,890
were great for cars at republic that

00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:16,450
were produced in 1998 and you wouldn't

00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,950
ever want to talk to a video card that

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,410
way in modern times you would want to

00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,000
talk to it in a totally different way so

00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:23,470
they have new functions to deal with the

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,720
way you want to do it in shader programs

00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,760
in the programmable pipeline but

00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,200
then you still have all those old

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,880
functions and it's not always clear

00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,680
which ones you should and should not be

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,540
using and usually you have to get it

00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,190
wrong until you get it right and

00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,320
sometimes the drivers make it hard to

00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,170
know when you've gotten it right and

00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:45,070
it's a mess my hope is that we're about

00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:47,980
to move past OpenGL too I don't know

00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,260
it's called next-gen API is like metal

00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,760
and mantle and DirectX 12 and whatever

00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,140
the next version of OpenGL will look

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,520
like which will probably similar which

00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,420
basically says take them all of that

00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,070
stuff and throw it the out and you

00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,710
have this very small thing you have

00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,820
command buffers you manage them you do

00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,140
whatever you want with threading and

00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,700
keeping track of this stuff and you sent

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,830
to the card it's incredibly low level

00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,090
and it's hard to juggle but it's all

00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,099
simple and does exactly what it says

00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,660
there's so much in the OpenGL state

00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:16,780
machine that's hard to keep track of in

00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,580
modern times and whatever the next thing

00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,590
is it OpenGL does and those other api's

00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,000
solves that problem a lot better to

00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,670
answer your question the documentation

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,230
is a certain there's a certain way of

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,390
life to the documentation and you have

00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,160
to adapt to it but it is very very well

00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,720
documented once you get to that point I

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,070
have two minutes left any other

00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,070
questions yes

00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,600
what's the current situation

00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:51,040
you're asking if we will get good

00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:52,420
quality free software drivers when we

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,890
get to those next api's is that we were

00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,220
asking or just didn't or you talk about

00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:59,829
steamer okay it's better than you think

00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:02,020
right now I was surprised that somebody

00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:03,220
took the nvidia hardware and reverse

00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,400
engineered enough that you can run

00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:08,050
shaders on those things and I mean this

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,309
is true of any OpenGL driver no matter

00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,290
whether it's commercial and closed

00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:12,940
sourced or written by people that are

00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,869
saying in their garage with a Scylla

00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,349
scope trying to figure out how the

00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,760
hardware works they're all broken until

00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:20,619
about a week after game ships that

00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,510
breaks them and then they go oh well

00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,309
that's slow on our card because he did

00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,839
something that's totally correct for the

00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:27,609
spec but our Hardware didn't expect our

00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,869
drivers didn't expect and then they fix

00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:30,130
it and we all go on next trip for the

00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:31,599
open-source ones as much as everything

00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,550
else and all of these games have gone a

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,750
long way to fix it I've gotten a lot of

00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,059
bug reports where it's like this just

00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,160
crashes on startup on mesa with the

00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:40,809
intel drivers send it on to ian and the

00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,030
end goes oh I broke it and Ian ramnik

00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:44,980
fixes it and we go on and his team which

00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:46,480
is surprisingly good we used to make fun

00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,380
of Intel for their video chips but

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,420
they've actually gotten to be pretty

00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,349
good like you shouldn't feel bad about

00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,420
them and they're really committed to

00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:54,520
open-source drivers like Intel pays

00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,290
people on staff to do that so that

00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,119
features getting brighter every day and

00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,309
it already doesn't suck if you'd asked

00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:01,480
me three years ago it sucked but it's

00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:03,250
already getting better and it's getting

00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,280
better all the time so any other

00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:07,480
questions anyone I saw someone I didn't

00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,130
mean to scare you off we have time it's

00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,579
okay I'm gonna ignore him when he tells

00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:15,720
me to stop anyway no okay I'm around for

00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,720
questions afterwards thank you very much

00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,330
your customers rely on your website or

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,700
application if it's slower

00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:03,670
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,470
and costs you money keeping your

00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,990
business critical systems humming along

00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:11,300
requires insight into what they're doing

00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,250
your system metrics tells stories

00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,260
stories that can reveal performance

00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,600
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:19,160
other problems but how do you keep an

00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,800
eye on all of your systems performance

00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,860
metrics in real-time and record this

00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,810
data for later analysis enter longview

00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,610
the new way to see what's really going

00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,770
on under the hood the long view

00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:32,840
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:35,300
of all your systems providing you with a

00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:38,660
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,240
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:43,010
load and network usage click a specific

00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,410
system to access its individual

00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:47,920
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:50,330
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,010
comprehensive network data including

00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:54,320
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,880
available on the network tab and disk

00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,800
rights and free space on the disk

00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,650
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:03,170
displays usage statistics for individual

00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,330
processes the system info tab shows

00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,580
listening services active connections

00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:09,710
and available updates adding long view

00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,420
to a system is easy just click the

00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,550
button copy the one line installation

00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,010
command then run the command on your

00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,690
linux system to complete the process the

00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,880
agent will begin collecting data and

00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:21,730
sending it to longview then the graph

00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,280
start rolling

00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:26,680
use longview to gain visibility into

00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:30,390
your servers so when your website or app

00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,390
