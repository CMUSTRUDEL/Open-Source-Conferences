the south east linux fest would like to

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,949
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:29,250
2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:32,759
possible ok my name is David Cantrell

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,399
and if you're here about Slackware then

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,380
you're in the right place this is old

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,329
timer Slackware rag - I didn't actually

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,710
come up with the title I don't know who

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,160
did but I'm just we're going to run with

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,680
it for those who don't know me I used to

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,770
be part of the Slackware Linux core team

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,079
a long time ago and people will

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,860
occasionally ask me about what I did was

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,629
Slackware and you know do I do anything

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,680
with it anymore so I don't know I

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,289
thought this would be an interesting

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,170
opportunity to kind of walk through the

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,909
past and what I dealt with it Slackware

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,210
is kind of some of the old problems and

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,220
and how stuff was terrible back then and

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,360
how stuff is terrible today but in a

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,640
different way I also am NOT going to go

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,140
all the way back to the beginning we're

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,500
not going to talk about how we installed

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,500
using 65 floppy disks which is the most

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,350
common comment I see from people online

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,640
when the topic of slack work comes out

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,350
those people are all lying none of them

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,270
ever installed slack were from floppy

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,159
disks especially if they graduated in

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,439
2005 so we're going to talk about the

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,850
more recent slack we're history the

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,500
mid-90s and I guess early 2000s this is

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,659
the part that everyone skips over and

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,670
it's when Linux was really big and

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,950
booming this is the time period when Red

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,470
Hat my current employer IPO this was

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,939
when tons of money was coming at Linux

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,009
everyone wanted a piece of it and

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,229
everyone did everything they could to be

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,930
in that game it was very interesting to

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,310
be part of that time period I have some

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,840
photos in here and you'll get to see

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,940
you'll get to see the slack where

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
corporate jet yes we did actually have a

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,190
corporate jet and it was really kind of

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,500
interesting so

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,120
all right what as I explained let's talk

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,620
about the bad old days old tech was

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,020
difficult and annoying new tech is

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,710
differently annoying and I like to talk

00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,960
about old stories why and it's primarily

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,420
primarily because I want people to

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,150
understand what we went through so we

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,210
don't recreate the same problem I see

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,650
that happen a lot today where people new

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,570
to Linux which is great we want new

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,730
people they will be approaching a

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,920
problem and they won't understand what

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,200
went on even like two or three years ago

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,060
and it's the exact same thing so I find

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,820
that you know telling these stories it's

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,870
fun and you get to remember hey we did

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,330
something like that

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,870
you know a while ago let's go and look

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,670
at how it worked or didn't work like I

00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,320
said I rarely get to talk about this I

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,330
do a lot of presentations at Red Hat

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,960
conventions and conferences and things

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,390
like that but despite having worked at

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,580
Red Hat now for almost nine years and

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,590
having been out of Slackware for so long

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,160
it is still the most common thing I get

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:18,070
recognized for and asked about so here

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,630
we go this is lifted from my

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,400
presentation last year I'm David

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,910
Cantrell I manage the installer team at

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,430
Red Hat I went to Georgia Tech studied

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,140
computer science this is a short list of

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,880
projects I've worked on starting with

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,830
slack where after step the window

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,690
manager Python fedora

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,940
Red Hat Enterprise Linux anaconda the

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,540
Installer proc PS new part add pipe are

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,580
dead ISC DHCP network manager and the

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,340
list goes on I've had my hands in a lot

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,989
of things which means that my code is on

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,690
a lot of devices that I pay a lot of

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,220
money for I learned that proc PS and

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,920
card ad are part of the nest thermostat

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,510
and I just spent $500 on those and it

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,010
was like you know what I wrote some of

00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,680
that code they should give me one of

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,380
those but no oh yeah and the common

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,090
desktop environment ok Slackware

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,739
releases with me around how many people

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,260
have seen the unofficial Slackware

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,560
release history it's on like slacker org

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,299
okay or something yep okay so that's

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,760
actually a really good detailed history

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,739
there is a short time period in there

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,760
like I was describing the mid 90s to

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:27,130
2000 where I was heavily involved

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:32,650
I put 3.4 but I think it was 3.3 3.4 3.5

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:34,710
3.6 3.9 407 oh and 71 I was gone after 7

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,060
1 because I stopped receiving a paycheck

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,060
does anyone remember slack we're three

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,990
point nine okay you remember the

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,210
difference between it and 4.0 there we

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,410
go yeah 2.0 colonel yeah a lot of people

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,380
still wanted to stick with the - Oh

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,120
colonel and we had moved to 2.2 with

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,360
slack were 4.0 so that was the only

00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,460
thing that was different and I you know

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:04,000
kept a lot of the users happy tradeshows

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,460
I spent a large part of my time going to

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,190
trade shows starting with the very first

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,240
Linux World Conference & Expo in 1998 in

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,120
San Jose California

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,750
then IDG started doing at least two of

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,169
those a year and I kept going to every

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,700
single one we also did in that world I

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,000
have no idea where it was or when it was

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,650
I just remember you remember being there

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,440
Comdex when that was like a seeing is it

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,720
still show I don't even know if it is

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,280
and because I'm from Atlanta I made sure

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,780
we went to the Atlanta Linux showcase

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:41,050
when I was a show show location San Jose

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,120
San Francisco New York Las Vegas Linux

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,889
was really big at this time there was a

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,380
lot of money to spend so we went to

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,419
really good venues the Javits Center in

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,750
New York the Convention Center in Vegas

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,190
we use is no longer standing Atlanta one

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,599
of them used the World Congress Center

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,880
in the air the other one used Cobb

00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:00,729
Galleria Center we use the Moscone in

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,200
San Francisco San Jose Convention Center

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:06,639
it was comparable size that we used

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,669
there wants to see pictures alright so

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,810
here's the very first Linux world this

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,330
was 1998

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,870
that's me standing up sort of facing the

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,640
camera

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,190
the guy to the left that's Logan Johnson

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,080
and the guy behind him is Brett person

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,830
eating nachos

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,620
our primary goal at this show was to

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,030
sell t-shirts and we sold a lot of

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,180
t-shirts because everyone wanted a

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,100
t-shirt my we used this booth for a long

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,220
time this was 10 feet by 10 feet and

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,010
that's just a carpeted background and I

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,770
hated that sign because it said linux

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,300
slackware it's like why can't we reprint

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,240
this damn thing to say Slackware Linux

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,470
no one calls it linux slackware but they

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,530
never did because that costs too much

00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,890
money apparently we were instead paying

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,650
for Union guys to plug in our computers

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,290
and set up our chairs which if you did

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,990
that on your own you got fined here's me

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,310
in the corporate jet can't really see it

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,110
on the screen very well but these will

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,850
be posted online our corporate jet was a

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,720
1993 Buick Regal got a little under 20

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,490
miles to the gallon

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,910
it was quite comfortable on the inside

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:23,610
had working air conditioning and a very

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:25,530
very ample luggage space occasionally I

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,250
was a pilot in command but on this trip

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:33,810
I was enjoying being a passenger this is

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,210
the Atlanta Linux showcase again this

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,490
was I don't even know where it was a lot

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,140
of so these pictures all came to me from

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,830
people who took them and then emailed

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,620
them to us

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,940
they were taken with real film cameras

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,390
and then scanned which is why the

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,630
quality is total crap but that's what we

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,250
had back then so these are just they

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,200
were as interesting to me when they

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,460
showed up and I just kind of filed them

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,190
away forever this is in Las Vegas that's

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,560
all of us well we're almost all looking

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:10,530
at the camera that vulgar kneeing me

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,890
Chris lumens and the back of Logan's

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,860
head this was inside the 50 foot by 50

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,510
foot bsdi booth which we were anchored

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,580
to bsdi for a while

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,520
emphasis on anchor I went down with the

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,889
ship that was pretty fun

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,780
this is us in New York trying to get

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:31,229
slack we're working on a sony vaio

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,899
laptop so old stuff sucked a lot

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,719
including laptops none of the hardware

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,750
worked out of the box that was a kernel

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,029
developer who was trying to help us out

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,270
we only ever got you know two or three

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:49,470
devices working and then gave up it was

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:53,399
frustrating back then and this is Walnut

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,770
Creek cd-rom in Times Square not a great

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,899
picture but a lot of these guys have

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:04,200
moved on to Apple the FreeBSD guys and

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:07,200
well obviously I'm at Red Hat this was

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,690
the famous BSD booth and the Slackware

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,930
booth which was the former FreeBSD booth

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,720
which we repurposed with the big s dot

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,149
on it that was a rotating sign that we

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,279
had that lit up in the middle again lots

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,079
of money I mean it just it was crazy

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,520
that we had cranes to set all this stuff

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:29,370
up and we had a we had to 18-wheelers to

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,470
bring our stuff to each trade show and

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,820
then we and then everyone flew on

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,130
different flights cuz you don't want to

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,959
fly everyone on the same flight for fear

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,089
of crashing and killing the entire

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,490
development to you exactly yeah

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,020
so like I was saying these photos were

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,880
sent to us by random people we

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,730
oftentimes got people who would come up

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,990
and say hey oh you're you're David on

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,640
the slack routine can I get a picture

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,520
with you sure I have no idea who you are

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,850
and well these pictures would show up in

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:03,570
our inbox this is Chris lumens with

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:08,850
someone you can see the the back of the

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:10,589
badge had bsdi we always paid to sponsor

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,740
those badges that was another one of

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:16,050
those things we just had money to burn

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,079
this is in New York I was this was the

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:22,470
only show where we demoed Slackware

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,160
Linux on spark and that's a Sun ultra 10

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,139
there and

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,209
as a bsd kernel developer who was

00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:32,670
disappointed that i was not showing

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:35,069
freebsd running on spark and then i told

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,370
him but you guys don't support spark so

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:39,959
also it's bsd and i don't really care

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,490
does that seem guy again I don't know

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,529
he's senator sent us a bunch of pictures

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,180
this was in New York as well and you can

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,410
see some of the companies in the

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,730
background I don't know if anybody's

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,079
been paying attention to that there's VA

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:55,339
Linux if anyone remembers that company

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,769
here's that ultra ten again son was very

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,569
supportive of Slackware being ported to

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:04,170
spark they gave us a lot of a loaner

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:06,360
hardware they put us on son comm the web

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,220
site they gave us lots of resources it

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,990
was really cool of course when the

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,000
company went under

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,189
they sent me a bill for all the hardware

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,149
and I was like yeah that's not gonna

00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:17,819
work

00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:19,769
so Chris and I rented a u-haul loaded

00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:22,709
everything up and drove it back to Santa

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,829
Clara so we only had to pay ninety nine

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:28,019
bucks for you all to return it all had

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,970
to take it back to building 27 the big

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,910
giant sign hanging from the ceiling was

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,829
I pushed for that a lot we had the art

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,500
department put that together and then it

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:39,389
was a frame we had used it for FreeBSD

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,329
and they stopped using it once they got

00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,980
the big 50 by 50 booth so we wrapped it

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,829
with a slack or banner and you had to

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,410
pay he had to pay the convention center

00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:51,300
to bring in a crane to hang it but that

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,250
that was really popular at the time you

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,630
know every company had something hanging

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,600
from the ceiling if they wanted to be

00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,339
seen I don't know what happened to any

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,470
of this stuff I don't know where any of

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,380
the booth equipment ended up I assume

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,620
it's either in garages and basements or

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,050
it just got left in buildings and trucks

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,500
but that stuff was very expensive to

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:16,050
come by here's the whole team in San

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,910
Jose and we're all facing the camera

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,089
which is really cool so left right we

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,579
have Pat me Logan Johnson Chris lumens

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,689
and Kate Hornburg who did art work for

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,339
us for a while

00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,829
my favorite thing in this picture is in

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,750
the background we see Hilux code the

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,990
gnome company remember them before they

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,939
change their name to Simeon we have Sun

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,220
Microsystems hanging from the ceiling

00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:40,490
there

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,890
and II Grail which I can't remember what

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,800
they did but I remember their booth they

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:49,070
had they they paid for a guy to stand in

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,840
the corner with a headset mic and just

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,960
kind of draw people in and we heard this

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:58,190
five minute demo just repeat for three

00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,480
days it was really annoying so yeah I

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,450
don't know I don't know what happened to

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,070
them and we also this was in New York

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,220
again we had Slackware Linux ported to

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,160
alpha which we demoed that was a loaner

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,730
system I think from digital or alpha

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,080
processor corporated the Alpha was fun

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,750
at the time it was the fastest system

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,510
that we had to work with and compact

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,980
provided us with a C compiler so

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,540
companies in the background that I was

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,460
pointing out store makes technologies

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,220
who remembers them Vancouver British

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,320
Columbia they made storm Linux which was

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,200
one of many failed commercial attempts

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,420
at Debian our current failed attempt as

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,420
Ubuntu we also

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,970
yeah let's see their storm Linux in

00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,040
Murdoch also founded product progeny

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:55,930
which went for a couple of years and

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,900
that folded Carell also in Canada they

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,550
made Corral Linux around this time

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,190
Carell put a lot of engineering effort

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:06,750
behind Linux in general specifically

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,100
wine and KDE Carell is the reason we got

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,720
Windows Network neighborhood browsing

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,330
and KDE they did all that work and

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,460
they're the reason wine was really

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,240
brought up to speed and can run a lot of

00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,640
useful applications if you need that but

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,680
they couldn't really make make any

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,900
headway with Corral Linux because that

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,290
name associated with Linux just didn't

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,570
work

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,130
storm was storm was an interesting

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,110
company I got to meet the founder he was

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,900
a really cool guy and they came up with

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,140
some interesting technologies that still

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,630
live on in Debian today Linnea was in

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,370
the background I can't remember what

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,040
they did turbo Linux and you want to

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,620
remember them yeah turbo Linux you know

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,840
what happened to them well okay they

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,490
they merged before completely going

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,010
under they merged with a company called

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,400
Linux care does anyone remember Linux

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,230
care

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,880
yeah the general support company you

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,320
could just call him up and say I'm

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,000
running slack where I want to buy a

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,290
support contract and they would they

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,690
would certainly sell you a support

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,550
contract I question what kind of support

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,330
you got from them but it worked for a

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,940
few years

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,060
turbo Linux was really big in Japan

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,000
couldn't really make headway in the u.s.

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:19,780
it was originally a Japanese translation

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,510
of Slackware but then sort of underwent

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,970
a lot of changes and they decided to

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:29,620
prop each other up on their way to

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:31,690
failure but they they were they had

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,030
interesting booths as well they they had

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,680
they hired a guy I don't know if his

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,880
site is still up but he went by the name

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,650
the info Tainter and this guy he was he

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,870
was like a used car salesman and he was

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,300
just really big into the I'm standing on

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,620
a trade show and hey hey you have you

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,190
heard about turbo Linux and you know

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,839
just kind of the

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,600
corner salesmen and it would it would be

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,790
bring people into the booth and what was

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,770
irritating is that we were for whatever

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,230
reason always positioned next to them

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,760
and they would use the aisle and he

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,370
would stand on the corner and he's like

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,700
oh well you know they're overflowing but

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:12,570
we're not breaking any rules I have a

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:15,300
video of our retaliation that we did in

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,610
Las Vegas it involved a lot of nerf

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,810
weapons and public humiliation and it

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,490
was kind of fun he got really

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,459
embarrassed but you know in the end he

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,860
realized it didn't matter red hat and

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:31,260
background and still around so that's

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,120
good VA Linux which this was after they

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,020
had changed her name for VA research I

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,149
don't know if you remember when they

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,800
were called that and then after VA Linux

00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,170
they went through what like five

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,180
thousand name changes and I don't know

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,980
what happened to them I tried to figure

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,290
that out yesterday

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,680
O'Reilly still alive and going somehow

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,170
with books helix code which is my my

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,920
favorites because we we got them in

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:59,670
there with before they were similar well

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,980
VA Linux started SourceForge they they

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,920
started that and then ended their

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,980
hardware business and focused primarily

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,230
on software and for a long time they

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,959
were providing mirrors for all the

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,000
distributions and it was cool I had an

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,170
SSH account into their FTP server for a

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,750
while and it was they had lots of

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,939
bandwidth and SourceForge was it was

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,189
early in that whole sort of integrated

00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,839
you know we're gonna host your project

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,780
provide bug tracking and stuff but now

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,760
it's you know it's if it hasn't

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,100
completely lost ground it's certainly

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,370
losing ground to more modern things like

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,320
github and things like that

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:43,140
eager ale don't know them Sun

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,700
Microsystems all right the book a lot of

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,160
people ask me about the Slackware Linux

00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,010
essentials book yes we wrote a book to

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,420
replace the rusty gear book that had

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,040
been shipping with slack where ever

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,440
since Walnut Creek serum had been

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,419
publishing them we called it Slackware

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,279
Linux essentials

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,079
at some point in time I don't know if

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,139
it's still up there but Amazon has me

00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,509
listed as an author which I think it's

00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:09,450
kind of weird we had to write software

00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:13,049
to to help sgml tools along we were

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,749
required to write the book in sgml

00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:19,469
because that was the hot thing at the

00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:21,179
time it was a lot of late nights trying

00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:24,059
to get it to generate an index it was

00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,609
really very annoying we converted it to

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:30,119
attack actually Chris did the conversion

00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:32,039
to latech but that was after the company

00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,339
went under and we never published it

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:39,299
again still have all the sources the

00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:42,570
website WWE um that's me and Logan who

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,669
primarily did that you're welcome

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:50,070
Slackware for the longest time never had

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:52,200
a website we we didn't really have a

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,339
plan we just wanted to get something up

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,289
and running and then it sort of stuck we

00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:01,019
put we had web discussion forums on

00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:04,349
there we use the forum software written

00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:08,549
in PHP and this is actually wrong we

00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:13,200
used PHP too at the time again it was at

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:18,419
that point in time it was static HTML

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:22,919
PHP or Perl and I don't know why we want

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:24,839
what PHP obviously the logo so I still

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,489
see the logo around to this day there's

00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,769
a shirt Slackware Linux shirt you have

00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:31,349
one on and it's amazing to me this was

00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:33,269
done in a Georgia Tech dorm room using

00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:36,209
 on whatever version of Slackware we

00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:38,459
had Logan came up with it using the

00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,869
courier font and just toss two lines in

00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:42,570
there and we're like yeah it looks good

00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:45,089
and we put it on the site and I am

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,749
shocked that it's still kind of the logo

00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:51,959
like it's everywhere I just I don't know

00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:55,619
it's kind of weird to me does anyone

00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:59,539
remember 4.0 - 7.0 ok yeah yeah does

00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,539
anyone remember like why we did that

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,260
yeah well

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,160
yeah well that was that was part of the

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,980
justification so we were moving from Lib

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,690
C 5 to G Lib C but we skipped all the

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,220
version numbers because at those trade

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,660
shows people would come up to us and

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,210
like the current version of red hat at

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,530
the time was 6 dot something or whatever

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,070
they would come up to us and say when

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,500
are you going to upgrade to Linux 6.2

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:31,020
and you know this was this would be just

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,460
IT people this would be press this would

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,240
be analysts we're like you know what

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,490
this is

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:40,140
you know forget all this let's just jump

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,720
the version number so we did and yeah it

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,900
just kind of ran from there and I think

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,710
after that Patrick he was just doing dot

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:54,210
zeros and dot ones for a while once you

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:57,059
know that's that works yeah there were

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,500
there were a lot of long discussions and

00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,380
a lot of back and forth as to whether or

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,419
not we should do it and I forget the

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,460
exact circumstances or quantity of

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:08,580
alcohol consumed before we decided to do

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,770
that but it was in San Jose when we made

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,190
a decision where did we get our

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,590
paychecks subscriptions so anyone that

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,510
subscribes to Slackware thank you that

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:21,410
paid me for a while

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,270
any time we made a release we would do

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,340
and then you could bill all of the

00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,200
subscription credit cards immediately

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,990
which was very useful

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,450
OpenBSD kind of survives on that model

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,360
doing two scheduled releases a year at

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,280
$50 canadian apiece and that guarantees

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,040
a certain amount of income per year

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,760
which is useful for the project we had a

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,380
similar model Walnut Creek cd-rom was my

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,940
first employer they were the publisher

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,770
they were then we were acquired by B SDI

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,960
and then I don't have it on here but we

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,630
were we merged with Telenet systems and

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,880
san jose's so we really had no idea what

00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:01,960
we were doing at that point when bsd i

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,910
acquired us they were so desperate to

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,780
push freebsd that we started being

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,490
pushed to the side and you know even at

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,800
the linux shows it's like this is called

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,720
linux world and you're giving us a

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,240
ten-by-ten booth and you're giving

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,250
freebsd a 50 by 50 booth that doesn't

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,850
make sense so a lot of people were

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,440
confused about you know how are these

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,600
positioned they compete with each other

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,090
or the complementary is one based on the

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,330
other so they kind of they kind of screw

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,120
up on that a lot in my opinion

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,730
ultimately we ran out of money and had a

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,110
fire sale to Wind River in Alameda

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:47,210
California which we call win driver

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:49,190
Mamie VxWorks and some other crap but

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:53,390
they were only interested in acquiring

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:55,370
the FreeBSD engineering assets so I was

00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,230
brought in and told what was happening

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,450
and handed a severance check and that

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,770
was it that was the end of my time with

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,850
slack where it wasn't really a shock we

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,310
kind of knew it was coming we just

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,190
didn't know when about a two months

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:13,700
prior suza laid off all of their North

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,850
American employees every company started

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,040
laying people off which just kind of you

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:23,180
know the wallets were empty at this

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:26,360
point wend rivers idea was that they

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,020
could be unique and go with FreeBSD in

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,940
the embedded

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,630
market but what's funny now is they

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,660
focus on Linux but whatever things that

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:39,410
seem forgotten so slacker had live CDs

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,480
before they were popular and I think

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,180
that most people forget that because at

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,490
that point in time cd-rom drives were

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,830
still fairly uncommon and even if you

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,840
had one most people didn't have burners

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,090
because they were very expensive which

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,360
is why the live CD was not posted as an

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,920
ISO download you had to buy the CD set

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,830
that was kind of a value add as we give

00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,050
you a live CD and this was I mean for a

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,780
long time slacker had this and it just

00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:08,510
sort of no no one remembers that I guess

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,040
or no one it wasn't it wasn't a big

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,350
enough impact because at the time it was

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,110
available it just wasn't as useful as it

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:18,710
is today does anyone remember zip slack

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,810
and big slack yeah okay oh yeah yeah

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,200
that was uh that was kind of a cool hack

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:27,050
that Pat came up with doing using the u

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,940
ms-dos file system but then keeping it

00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,910
he kept zip slack around one hundred

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,480
megabytes and big slack was the size of

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,430
a jazz drive the one gigabyte thing I I

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,780
thought they were really cool it was you

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,420
know this was again the time period

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:45,190
before USB flash media so you know he

00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:48,650
had yeah exactly

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:52,790
yes yeah that was kind of the target

00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:54,710
media and they were very common I mean

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:58,990
it would everyone had a zip drive at

00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:01,840
that point in time I still have one

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:04,280
installation to you ms-dos this was

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,220
something that slack were did that I

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,890
thought was really unique to allow

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,650
people to install Slackware and not I

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,030
have to repartition or reflow mat which

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,730
at that point in time was quite

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,980
difficult to do safely and not lose data

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,760
so you could just clear a bunch of files

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:25,280
off of your PC make space on your fat

00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,560
volume and then just install Slackware

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,830
into a directory on that and it worked

00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:35,060
it wasn't going to be fast but it was it

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:37,250
was enough to get you some experience

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,800
with it before diving into the

00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,360
auditioning and resizing the tools for

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,660
that at that point in time we're very

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:51,460
very limited and scary old software

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:54,110
sucked a lot current software sucks to

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,820
my list of things that I dislike in the

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,400
world of Linux keeps growing every day

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,690
that I continue using Linux and I think

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,490
part of that is because I've been using

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,040
it too long you know we make fun of

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,600
olden UNIX people for hating things like

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,800
a GNU bash and stuff like that they're

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,870
like guys it's not like Bourne shell

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,310
it's what I started on his stuff well

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,710
you know we get that way in the Linux

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,800
community - I hate gnome 3 I hate

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:18,400
systemd I hate C groups I hate current

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:22,520
KDE I don't use any of this crap at all

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,580
and yeah you know I mean I just but I

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,710
know I know its purpose I know the user

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,120
it's trying to target but it's not me so

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,680
with that we do have a lot of things to

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,540
just work out of the box now and for

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,390
that I'm very thankful the Linux kernel

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,890
has come a long way and hardware has

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,710
come a long way we don't have to deal

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,560
with finicky Hardware anymore and I also

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,390
think the popularity of Linux in general

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,610
for getting major hardware companies to

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,680
commit full-time people to maintaining

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,040
kernel support without that we wouldn't

00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,810
have things like wireless networking or

00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,450
sound that works without spending a week

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:02,120
futzing around with the kernel

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,560
we used to kill so many hours working on

00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,900
that kind of stuff and if I was doing

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,880
this presentation back then I would

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,440
probably pick one thing to talk about

00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,690
and tell you how to write a config file

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,580
or tell you how to recompile your kernel

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,480
to get one thing working that's what we

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,070
did back then so what am I talking about

00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,530
you wanted a GUI all right that meant

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,660
you're using X 486 no it's so bad right

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,820
well you got to write your xf 86 config

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,740
file okay well that doesn't seem so hard

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,090
to find some font path so well you know

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,000
I can probably go with the template ah

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,670
and then you get to mode lines who

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,130
remembers mode lines how many people fry

00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,210
to monitor with all that stuff yeah all

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,750
right there we go

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,470
that was sort of the rite of passage you

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:47,030
destroy some hardware just to get a GUI

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,830
all right and then of course you know

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,270
it's going to run in 16 color until you

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,880
figure out what line you had to

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:55,370
in the screen section in the virtual

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,950
virtual because we all had 640 by 480 or

00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,690
if we were lucky eight by six and X

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,540
wanted to run as if it were on a screen

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,340
this size and so he had that virtual

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:07,040
it's like who thought that was useful

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:11,179
right yeah just go and set that to zero

00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,470
zero to make it usable okay you've got

00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,910
your mode in lines written you have x3

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,410
eighty-six up and running now you need a

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,480
window manager well we don't have

00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,460
desktop environments we have to pick a

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
window manager which one do I use I

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,880
don't know anything about window

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,610
managers which one are you using fvw em

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,770
okay I'll go with that it sounds good

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,120
can I have your config file Thanks

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,429
all right now I'm just gonna adapt that

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,050
and hope it works now all I have is X

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:35,179
term I spent all that time to get a

00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,809
graphical user interface only to get a

00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:39,260
command prompt in a window yes it was

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,260
fun

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:45,110
well let's browse the web now wait hold

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,900
on we got to configure dial-up anyone

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:50,990
ever use dial-up on Linux yeah it's fun

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,610
right yeah spend a lot of time okay

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,980
let's get online if you have Ethernet

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:58,070
you're at a university awesome just plug

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,080
it in and use ifconfig and or DHCP

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,110
whichever client you prefer at that

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,450
point in time but most of us had dial-up

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,530
at home we didn't have broadband we

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:12,920
didn't have any of that kind of stuff

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:16,040
and PPP was a to configure yeah

00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,760
and it's you know I feel sorry for

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:23,809
anyone who still has to work with this

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:26,300
writing chat scripts by hand but but to

00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:30,650
ease the pain slack where did come with

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:32,330
PPP setup which was extremely useful it

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,270
was just a dialogue be a shell script

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,640
and it worked on other distributions I

00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:40,100
copied it to a lot of systems and used

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,480
it to configure PPP and it was enough to

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,770
get up and running so that you could

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,830
then browse the web oh yeah when modems

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,650
now man well at this point in time

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,650
you're just kind of screwed sorry you

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:58,340
can go by us are you know yeah so okay

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,920
now let's browse the web links really I

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,780
got to use that it sucks yeah I want I

00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:06,050
want to see what's on the web well

00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,970
Netscape Navigator as your answer so

00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,410
fire that up oh wait it doesn't come

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,270
with Slackware cuz it's commercial

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:14,720
software so you got to go to FTP

00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,610
Netscape comm dive down 9000 directories

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,730
find the tarball run the setup script

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,460
which is effectively pointless which is

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,380
just copy stuff somewhere and then find

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,250
the binary run it and the fonts look

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:31,730
like crap also why is it so slow why is

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,620
it so slow as a motif it was statically

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,690
linked none of us had commercial motif

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,950
so they had to link the library end but

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,700
I'm glad they did otherwise we wouldn't

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,920
have had a browser

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,390
who cares some commercial company

00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,370
release software for Linux and that was

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,470
the big thing you know I have Netscape

00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,480
running on my Linux toast that was

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,230
pretty cool no that was terrible

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,230
let's watch a movie

00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:59,289
yeah not gonna happen well what did we

00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,750
use we didn't have VLC we didn't have in

00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:03,309
player and a totem the whole GStreamer

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,830
stacked whatever the hell Katie he has

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:09,700
we didn't have any of that we used to ex

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:12,460
anima who used ex annum okay

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,380
compiled from source after finding your

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,890
object files that you needed okay so

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:20,169
this guy up in Massachusetts he he

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,419
decided that he was going to do this

00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:25,120
service for the open source community

00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:28,539
this thankless job and signed these

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,900
NDA's with the companies holding the

00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:34,780
patents for the Codex then he would

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,070
compile all of the Codex he wrote us

00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,830
code so he can compile it all as

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,450
individual object files post the object

00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,470
files for you to download and he picked

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,230
the Codex you want

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,559
and he Adam built four different

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:49,659
architectures so he had Intel he had

00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,669
SPARC alpha all this stuff he did this

00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,049
just on his own time you would download

00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:55,049
these you had to edit your

00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,060
I make file then run xmk MF - a then

00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,070
editor make file because it was going to

00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,320
generate a bad make file and then build

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:08,050
it and hopefully you got an X annum

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,020
binary that would play a QuickTime movie

00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,310
that you downloaded two weeks ago but

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,750
then you found out that it was using the

00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:16,270
Sorensen codec and that was not

00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:20,920
available and all you wanted to do was

00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:24,070
watch a trailer for a movie well maybe I

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,410
can look at a PDF that actually worked

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,930
adobe has always released acrobat reader

00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,730
and you could always get it from ftp

00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,800
adobe comm that's actually really cool

00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,240
adobe sucks in a lot of ways but they

00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,230
always made sure that this was available

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,210
and you didn't have to dive through

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,760
their damn website to get it you just

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,140
had to go to the ftp site and

00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,810
surprisingly it was not completely

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:47,860
terrible it actually did work and the

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:49,450
fonts didn't look like crap how do I

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,490
play music can I do that at least I

00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,650
can't watch a movie web browsing slow I

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:57,160
can play music right when you got a

00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,350
recompiling kernel okay let's let's get

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,430
ready for that buckle in

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,370
okay you got to pick the right OSS

00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:05,950
options and then you got to build a

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,900
sound ah file for your system these

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:11,050
don't come with the distribution because

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,870
you can only pick one sound card driver

00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,700
it's gonna output one sound ato file

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,100
hope you get it right now you use

00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,330
modprobe to load that module you should

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,490
be good to go at this point you should

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,800
have dev DSP dev audio dev mix and all

00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,620
that will be working Oh your system

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:29,860
locked up why didn't you tell me you had

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,590
an Isis sound card now we have to

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,590
initialize a PNP hardware does anybody

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:38,950
remember doing this alright gotta run

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:42,100
PNP dump now you're gonna get at CI so

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,080
PNP Kampf delete all the crap in there

00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,660
take only the settings for your device

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,690
edit our C dot local make sure you run

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:53,020
IC PNP to net the device before running

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,040
modprobe now doing that you should have

00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,380
sound

00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:00,130
this list goes on and on forever old

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:03,360
stuff sucked and we have a lot in the

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:05,890
world of Linux to be thankful for are

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,390
our problems now yes we have a lot of

00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,160
things that we argue about and bicker

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,050
about and you know things don't work and

00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,970
stuff but at least all this stuff is

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,800
kind of behind us right like I was able

00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,440
to plug this laptop into the projector

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,929
and it worked if I was doing that in

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:25,390
1998 huh yeah that's not gonna work

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:27,520
maybe I could try all right now I

00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,020
recently tried to install Slackware I

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,820
will confess that I have not used

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,510
Slackware since I was fired and I did an

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,650
install in a KVM vert guest and I was

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,020
surprised at some of the things I

00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:48,640
noticed first off what hell is Milo

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:50,440
still use okay all right yeah yeah right

00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,250
exactly so Lyla is not going to work for

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,650
you efi systems yeah so I was surprised

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:59,470
to see it still in use that was that was

00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,180
very odd to me I did notice the huge

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,160
kernel lacks Verdi Oh drivers which you

00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,720
mean for a KVM guest it would be nice if

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,860
that was included in the huge kernel but

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,870
that doesn't really matter

00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,220
the websites largely unchanged I'm

00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,900
embarrassed by that would someone please

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:17,470
change that because it's what I did back

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:20,320
in the mid 90s but probably most

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,270
importantly why does Slackware appeal to

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,700
so many people in the southeastern

00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:29,560
United States

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:32,950
I mean Patrick's from North Dakota

00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:38,080
so this is kind of weird and I say that

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:40,900
oh yeah I don't know I say that because

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,730
as a former core team member we were at

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,150
the Georgia Institute of Technology in

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,070
Atlanta this is it's still it's still

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:51,690
largely south east I find that really

00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:53,890
interesting ok things I wish we had done

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,420
regrets all right

00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,040
public read-only version control we

00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,650
never had anything available for that

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,090
and I really wish we had which would

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:07,750
have required us actually using version

00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:10,750
control yeah I know and I I've had that

00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,920
discussion with Patrick a lot and you

00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,630
know I understand why he doesn't want to

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,330
use it it's just another another level

00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,800
but having that history like I'm telling

00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,540
these stories right now that's kind of

00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,160
why you want to use version control as

00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,720
you can preserve all that history all

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,330
those things you did and undid and stuff

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,050
like that it would be nice it's probably

00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,430
easier now doing this with CVS probably

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:34,390
would have been annoying but it would

00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:36,010
have been possible back then at a

00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:39,460
network install support sooner we

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,840
actually had support for that but never

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,020
really pulled the trigger on getting

00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,700
that merged in but I noticed I did a

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,820
network install when I installed

00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,980
recently so I saw it was there I wish we

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,390
had had a wiki or whatever the hell was

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,100
the current thing at that time we did

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:57,450
have the forum which a lot of people

00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,910
relied on for sharing information but I

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:03,310
today see the arch linux wiki as being a

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,920
really good resource even for non arch

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,660
users and if Slackware had something

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,730
like that yeah i mean it could even

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,500
start something today I think that

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,600
there's a lot of a lot of that knowledge

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,270
that could get written down and just you

00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,400
know maintained by everyone I wish we

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,520
had had that and there's probably

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,930
something else I'm forgetting so that's

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,410
all I could come up with when I made

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:28,740
this so let's have the questions nope

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,740
none

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,090
what is that

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,040
Oh oh yeah

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:47,770
oh oh yeah I do remember these there's a

00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,770
phone number on here let's call it

00:37:47,859 --> 00:38:02,380
I'll see you answers alright it is 2014

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:06,280
let's see five one zero six seven four

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,280
zero seven eight three

00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:27,800
my former employer yes any other

00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,800
questions

00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,650
they did yes

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,760
they did they FreeBSD underwent a lot of

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,730
changes at that point in time

00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,299
Jordan Hubbard left and he went to Apple

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:02,910
and it was when Mac os10 was still very

00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:05,069
new and he was he took on the role of

00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:07,589
basically building up the darwin project

00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:09,779
inside of Apple and that over the course

00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:11,309
of I think six to twelve months he

00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,380
started bringing in a lot of the former

00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,869
FreeBSD guys and he went he went to Wind

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:19,170
River first cus you know yeah so yeah

00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:22,470
they ended up with nothing I did hear

00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:26,839
that that that they spun off that stuff

00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:31,069
again as like FreeBSD all.com yeah so

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,069
same group of people I guess

00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:43,730
so do you have any involvement with them

00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:43,730
with Slackware today no okay

00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,329
right

00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,420
yeah

00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,619
yeah

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,100
oh I know

00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,250
yeah

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,870
they probably don't know

00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,270
I

00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,570
you know I find this really interesting

00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,920
because I thought that no one working on

00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:02,570
the book would have a worse time than we

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:06,380
did but it sounds like you did I can

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:08,570
hook you up with that latech source yes

00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:13,400
yeah okay so there were a lot of in

00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:15,590
jokes that we put in the book and one

00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:20,600
was Hejaz which was I don't know how

00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:23,150
many times it appeared so there's the

00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,270
other one yeah okay so so Hejaz I do

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,520
remember we used it as a test case for

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,960
the index generating code because we

00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,400
knew how many times it appeared so then

00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,990
we looked in the index and if it had

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,730
counted them all we were like yeah

00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:45,410
that's probably good enough but Hejaz

00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:48,410
was all right so pris was from or is

00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,960
from Charlotte North Carolina and when

00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:54,500
he was in high school they were at some

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,570
event I forget what it was it doesn't

00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,560
matter but it was a public event and

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:04,820
there were a group of Shriners there and

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,040
they were wearing those hats and the

00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,540
hats had you know writing on them and I

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,660
don't really know all the details of

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:15,170
that organization but I just know they

00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:18,230
have those hats and he said one of the

00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:19,580
hats said Grand Master of Hejaz and he

00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,860
just thought that was really weird so

00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,690
his group at school started using the

00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,020
word he jazz is just a generic filler

00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:29,420
now my first exposure to the word was at

00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,890
Georgia Tech when he came in we were all

00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,510
working on a project he's like what the

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,680
hell is all this he jazz about I was

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,780
like what the hell are you talking about

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,940
and it just sort of stuck so we started

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,250
using that word as just a generic filler

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,430
for everything and that's where it came

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:46,330
from not as interesting as you we're

00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,330
hoping for probably

00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:56,819
47 of course we try to put that in there

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:58,680
as many times as possible yeah yeah we I

00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:01,380
can't remember we had a brief table

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,990
table of integrals that we tried to put

00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:08,369
into the book but I don't know if they

00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:12,500
removed that or not it's not there okay

00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:12,500
they were well we can bring that back

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:20,440
yeah so it means nothing basically just

00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:23,500
filler word

00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,089
it's really I mean it's explaining an

00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,220
inside-joke it never really carries

00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:35,799
forward and it's the timing and and

00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:40,990
stuff right well and everyone does and

00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:44,470
we wanted something different yeah yeah

00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:46,140
so we had our own filler work yes yes

00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:50,339
yeah

00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,339
questions comments anything else

00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,200
now

00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,780
yes

00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:08,110
less so than most other companies son

00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,920
son didn't really know how to advertise

00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:14,940
that fact but their engineering staff

00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:18,070
really wanted to work well with Linux

00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,280
even on their own hardware they still

00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:23,980
wanted to position Solaris as the

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,740
primary OS for their spark hardware in

00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,830
it you know that's fine but they never

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,470
you know tried to stop any of these

00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:37,450
porting efforts and which I thought was

00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:39,160
really unusual but they they saw it as

00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:42,510
something they needed to be part of and

00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,510
they needed to be in front of it

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,869
yeah

00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,140
right

00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:11,020
yes yeah yeah it's that there are

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,710
similarities son did try to make their

00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,109
own distribution it was based on Sousa

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:19,329
but they didn't really they didn't know

00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:22,230
how to execute that very well he tried

00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:24,280
to use the sort of the son model of

00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,589
making it available and that just

00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,660
doesn't you had the Linux market over

00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:30,490
here and you had the son market over

00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,559
here and they were putting it in the

00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,849
middle and no one no one ever really

00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:38,349
noticed it which was interesting

00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:41,280
of course they really tried to push

00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:44,109
Solaris on x86 hardware towards the end

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,930
but it was too late at that point some

00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:49,569
of those final Linux world shows one of

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:52,690
they're basically half of their booth

00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:56,589
was devoted to demonstrating a program

00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:59,309
called LX run which was that they had

00:45:56,589 --> 00:46:02,050
acquired it was it was a tool written by

00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:04,050
someone in Europe or some company in

00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:09,240
Europe and it would allow you to run

00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:12,369
Linux compiled Linux code on Solaris x86

00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,750
unmodified and you're thinking okay well

00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,960
you know that's probably gonna be a good

00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:19,119
stopgap but they demoed it running quake

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,549
to the Linux version of quake 2 and that

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,250
worked completely and you could play it

00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:26,559
and they that was that was what they

00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:28,599
were trying to push come to Solaris on

00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:34,410
x86 and you don't have to give up your

00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,410
Linux applications didn't work out

00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,960
to the other

00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,030
questions comments

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:48,900
I mean I've got a lot more stories I

00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:51,040
know there was stuff in here do what now

00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,200
you know I thought he would be here this

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:58,560
year but I I didn't talk to him before

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,560
heading down here but yeah yeah

00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:05,579
when was that okay

00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,579
yeah I

00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:16,930
No oh yeah battle over compilers

00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,529
packaging formats I'm looking what at

00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:24,299
what I was supposed to talk about

00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:24,299
no one asked me about these things yeah

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:32,819
yeah so file system standards we still

00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:35,589
argue about that and it's so

00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:37,749
irritating you know I don't care where

00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:43,619
stuff is just don't put it in dumb

00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:43,619
locations but

00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,010
yeah well here's what I predict with

00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,000
that as we'll go back we'll move

00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:55,240
everything back to user at some point

00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,339
but you know whatever I packaging

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,940
formats that was a big argument for a

00:47:57,339 --> 00:48:04,329
long time and the commercial vendors

00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:09,250
just didn't even bother making rpms or

00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:11,770
Deb's or tar.gz files because it's just

00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,359
a waste of time it's when you have every

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:16,089
vendor making their own slightly

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:20,050
different delivery mechanism for

00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:22,720
software I actually wish that we as a

00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,849
sort of community Linux in general could

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,750
standardize on something like that and

00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:33,520
just leave it as is all the systems are

00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:37,230
roughly comparable and where they have

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,530
gaps there are add-on tools so it it's I

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:43,270
think it would help a lot of people like

00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:48,099
distributing software making software

00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:50,680
available but whatever we may get there

00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:55,000
at some point we had a lot of compiler

00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:58,089
issues early on back when we had eg CS

00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:04,450
does anyone remember that so we had in

00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:08,740
GCS and we had K GCC for a while on some

00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:10,869
platforms and GCC 2.7 dot 2.3 in which

00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:14,770
we stuck with for a long time that was

00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:18,190
kind of the main compiler eg CS

00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:20,470
eventually merged into GCC of course but

00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,140
not before Red Hat released a CBS

00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:24,960
snapshot causing s o name problems for

00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:29,849
everyone on the planet

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:32,010
arrey I've gotten the story of that

00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:34,859
internally sort of partially at Red Hat

00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:37,079
and it was not despite what we talked

00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:39,359
about as Slackware it was not a move

00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,030
that was meant to hurt anyone it was a

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,430
bad engineering decision that was not

00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,690
communicated with marketing they came in

00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,190
and said we have to release right now

00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,339
it's like whoa hold on no we're not

00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:52,140
ready we need to wait and they said nope

00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:54,960
too late it's already gone to publish it

00:49:52,140 --> 00:50:02,730
and so yeah Red Hat was small at that

00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:06,180
point so yes yes exactly yeah

00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:13,650
so yeah I've got plenty of other stories

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:15,990
and painful things lots of Sousa as a

00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,900
fun company to make fun of huh they've

00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:22,400
had a lot of interesting moves over the

00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:25,619
years one of my favorite stories is

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,880
Sousa well I don't know if you guys know

00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:28,730
but Sousa was originally a German

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,720
translation of Slackware

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,460
with the agreement that they would never

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,380
marketed in the US so of course they

00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:39,359
didn't do that they merged whatever the

00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:44,390
company was merged with something else

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:47,359
and they took the German Jurek's jur IX

00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:51,180
I think that's what it was called and

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:53,160
that became the next Sousa so what they

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,900
actually marketed in the US wasn't

00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,450
Slackware anymore it was a totally new

00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:01,470
thing but you know the animosity is

00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:04,320
still there but yeah they had some some

00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,089
brilliant engineers when they they

00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,119
released a security update one time that

00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:12,599
included a developer's male spool file

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:17,250
in the RPM which was which was pretty

00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:19,140
cool this was back before you know build

00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,869
systems existed and you had checks in

00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,849
place and stuff like that they also they

00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:26,099
kind of had gen 2 syndrome for a while

00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:28,410
where they started experimenting with

00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:29,940
every possible GCC option thinking that

00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,800
the one-line description that it gave

00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,010
you and the man page sounded pretty cool

00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,599
so let's try that so they built I forget

00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:40,710
what the option was but they built with

00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,210
a symbol mangling option for C++ and did

00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:46,670
an entire release that way that ended up

00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:50,339
breaking every existing binary and then

00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:53,460
every everything that was commercially

00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:55,650
built could not run so they had to go

00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,940
and fix that but they were already stuck

00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,460
with it cuz they had released it so they

00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:02,160
had to carry compatibility libraries and

00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,160
symbols for that so don't just randomly

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,720
choose C flags

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,200
their lesson learned hopefully retained

00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:18,220
they continue to surprise me with their

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:18,220
ability to stay around and stay green

00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:29,850
well I think the timing for slack we're

00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,420
making that move was probably a bit too

00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:35,730
late

00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:39,120
honestly but not you know not like super

00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:41,250
late people were asking for it and the

00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:44,730
the big the big interest there was

00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:46,110
maintaining compatibility with things

00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,610
like Netscape and other commercial

00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,060
software because they're gonna start

00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:53,460
building 4G live sea based distributions

00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:58,650
and you need to have compatibility with

00:52:53,460 --> 00:53:01,860
that I I think that the way Slackware

00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:06,240
did that was pretty straightforward and

00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:09,290
done well I know there was a lot of

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,120
pushback because gee Lib C was huge

00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:14,430
project compared to Lib c5 but it really

00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,890
I think it was good in the long run if

00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:18,170
you still had multiple C libraries out

00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,550
there today

00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:23,060
for major distributions it would just be

00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:23,060
way too painful

00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:35,500
yes yeah they were and and lips e5

00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:41,080
development had stopped you know well

00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:44,290
before the move in seven oh yeah it I

00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:47,020
mean it was controversial I'm glad that

00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:49,270
slack were made that move there was

00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,600
really no reason to hang on to Lib c5

00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:55,930
other than it would avoid having to

00:53:52,600 --> 00:54:00,280
rebuild everything which is just a lot

00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:05,890
of work but it made things easier in the

00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:07,450
long run all right on the surprises or

00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:10,780
the observations I know that I forgot to

00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:13,360
mention that I was surprised that Pam is

00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:17,740
not there still Pam support for

00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:21,040
authentication which is to me quite

00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:25,290
surprising but Patrick was not not a big

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,290
fan of Pam stuff

00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,779
yes

00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:44,779
exactly

00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:53,349
well it's similar to the G ellipse

00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:56,320
e-tron's is like when do you make that

00:54:53,349 --> 00:55:01,750
decision and you know yeah it's he's

00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:05,290
ready to to do that you know 1999 will

00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:09,329
welcome him and get Pam in Slackware

00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,329
lunches useful

00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:16,690
like I said I have lots of other stories

00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,180
I just need catalyst to get going it's

00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:22,120
hard to come up with this on my own and

00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:24,250
you know beer is also welcomed so you

00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,520
know you guys want to chat over over

00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:31,590
some drinks you know that's fine it was

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:35,500
a fun time working on Slackware and I

00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:38,530
I'm glad I was part of that ride when

00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:43,510
when Linux was gigantic and we had a lot

00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:44,770
of companies in there and it's kind of

00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,950
an experience that you can't ever

00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:49,960
replicate but it's interesting to see it

00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:52,450
continuing though in a different way now

00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,600
I mean Linux is still huge but it's all

00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:57,190
new names and all new signs and

00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,830
hopefully Slackware can continue to

00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:02,890
remain around I look to Slackware as a

00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:05,260
voice of reason and conservatism when it

00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:08,590
comes to engineering decisions they

00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:11,320
usually offer a safe option if you're

00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:14,320
looking for how to do something and I

00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:16,690
think that is a huge quality for

00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,640
Slackware to carry and it's also a

00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:20,080
really good distribution for people to

00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,760
understand how the system is put

00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:24,720
together it still serves that purpose

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,720
very well I think

00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,710
so yeah

00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:43,250
I don't know if I'm out of time or not

00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:43,250
but I was expecting more heckling

00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,510
your customers rely on your website or

00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,880
application if it's slower

00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:24,850
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,650
and costs you money keeping your

00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:30,170
business critical systems humming along

00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:32,990
requires insight into what they're doing

00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:35,000
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:37,250
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,530
resource limitations and other problems

00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,630
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,910
your systems performance metrics in real

00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:46,760
time and record this data for a liter

00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:48,740
analysis enter long view the new way to

00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,780
see what's really going on under the

00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,970
hood the long view dashboard lets you

00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,890
visualize the status of all your systems

00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:57,800
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:00,740
your entire fleet you can sort by CPU

00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,440
memory swap processes load and network
