the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,330
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,920
possible started and we'll hope that the

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,189
wireless stays up long enough that we

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,200
can play with the plugins some of the

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,630
stuff that comes on at USB thumb drives

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,000
you do get the plugins pbi and you get

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,280
the three pbis to play with so there's

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,920
things you can play with and right now

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,930
those aren't available online it won't

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,820
be available online until beta 4 is

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,770
released so you guys are getting sort of

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,340
a pre-release version of that if you are

00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:01,320
creating the plugins jail you can

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,840
install it using either UF faster ZFS we

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,299
recommend ZFS because you can put it on

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
your own data set so again that makes

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:15,030
serve a different separation to install

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,250
freebsd into if you're installing on ufs

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,280
the only thing you can do is install in

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,920
a directory so I like that little extra

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,610
bit of separation so what we recommend

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,820
if you are doing ZFS is that you create

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,350
two data sets and I'm going to do that

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,780
because right now we don't have any data

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,530
sets for Dewey we have one so we have

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,380
data set 1 i'm going to create a second

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:47,579
data set and i'm going to call it

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:50,759
software so my logic when I'm creating

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,939
my two data sets is I'm going to use the

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,810
first data set for the freebsd operating

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:01,469
system itself that data set cannot be

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,930
less than two gigs in size if it is the

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,200
operating system won't fit so that one

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,090
needs to be at least two gigs the second

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,750
data set is where i'm going to install

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,140
all of my software and all of their

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,510
configurations

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,819
the size of that data set if you're

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,280
going to set a quota has to be big

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,100
enough to hold the software that you're

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,560
going to install and depending upon the

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,080
needs of that software if you're going

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,050
to be doing things like storing torrents

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,700
you can either do it in the jail or if

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,700
you also want that data to be shared

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,880
I'll show you how to make mount points

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,880
you can actually have it point to your

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,459
storage data and you can store say your

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,270
torrents there or whatever it is that

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,250
you're using your software for so that

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,080
is that one is where the OS is going to

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,000
go and then software is where the

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,459
software is going to go if we go into

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,880
services to install the plugins jail you

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:08,130
go into plugins and then that management

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,780
and settings and to create the plugins

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,510
jail you obviously have to already have

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,570
volumes so I'm just going to temporarily

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,980
place the plugins pbi on my main volume

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:23,070
here it's going to ask me where do you

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,870
want to stall the plugins jail so this

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,720
is going to be that data set that I

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,989
created for the freebsd operating system

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,230
and that was my first data set called

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:38,040
data set one so I can just browse to

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:42,769
that and close that button I give my

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,959
jail a name so let's just call it jail

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:49,620
whatever IP address you give your jail

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,380
has to be reachable so right now I'm on

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:59,610
this network let's see if we can find an

00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:05,510
address nobody's using 16 about 33 does

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,510
anybody using 201 that we know of

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:21,730
as one go on high up we're going to go

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:31,090
low let's try 21 then and are we on a /

00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:33,190
16 sorry it's just last 24 thank you the

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,140
plugins is where the software is going

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,980
to go so I'm going to use the data set I

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:41,380
created for that purpose called software

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,440
and close that everything that I'm doing

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,750
now is in that PDF so the instructions

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,640
are there and it's already made it into

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,700
the freenas documentation because I'm

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,980
trying to keep that up to date so I this

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,730
is where the OS is going to go and this

00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,790
is where the software is going to go so

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,520
we'll upload the jail pbi the last thing

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,050
it's going to ask for is the actual Jail

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,630
pbi which surprisingly I get into the

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,380
right directory here is called the

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:18,030
plugins jail pbi when you go and

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,380
download it there will be an Associated

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,480
sha-256 if you want to double check your

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,810
download it's not going to ask for it

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,450
does just going to ask for the pbi so

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,350
that file that I just browse to is on

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,169
that USB image or thumb drive so we're

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,480
just going to upload that and it will go

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,730
and install the freebsd operating system

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:44,320
inside of a jail so it takes a minute or

00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:46,450
two and seeing it's coming from my

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,100
system to yours it may take more than a

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,100
minute or two so we'll see how she goes

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,120
those of you that can do it locally it

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,120
should happen in like 30 seconds

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:28,330
correct which is cool none if it's been

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:32,520
ported to freebsd and right now there's

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,750
over 26,000 applications to choose from

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,690
only three of which have been turned

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,690
into pbi so far but we'll work on PBIS

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,850
what we'll do mini deal no will do

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,560
transmission first because it uses

00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,300
torrents so seeing that we're a bit slow

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,520
going from system to system that's the

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:09,210
first PB I will install so I can show

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:11,760
you that so what happens in a freebsd

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,860
jail the original design behind it was

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,500
supposed to be security it was supposed

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,000
to extend the idea of a chroot because

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,040
it's fairly easy to break out of a

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,080
chroot if you're a hacker and you know

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,670
what you're doing so the person who

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,130
designed it so that was part of his

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,650
design goal is you're basically stuck in

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,710
this OS and you can't go anywhere else

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,540
so that's the whole point of a jail

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,370
having said that there is something that

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:40,250
you can do which is called a mount

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:43,290
underscore null FS which will basically

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,870
create a pointer from the jail to a

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,510
directory outside of the jail so that

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,000
you can actually access the contents of

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,240
the jail so typically if you're not

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,030
doing mount no FS whatever you install

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,250
in the jail works but only works inside

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,860
the jail it wouldn't work on your host

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,900
operating system but as soon as you

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,690
create that mountain Allah fest it

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,180
becomes available to the operating

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,370
system now in our case it's not the

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,620
operating system that's using it it's

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,640
giving you access to data on your

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,640
storage disks

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:29,220
well I'll get you to install the next

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:50,220
one maybe because it will be locally I

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:51,840
forget how big it is yeah yeah 81 yeah

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,490
if we'd been smart about this i won

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,350
without him to do it locally but I don't

00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:02,880
know I don't know if I want to interrupt

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:07,140
it a good question so what shall we try

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,300
that or because it would be quicker for

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,160
him to do it locally now that you guys

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,900
have seen what the screen looks like you

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:20,400
don't have to watch the bar go by so

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:22,530
let's try that don't see if a panic

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,360
system do you want to try doing the

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:30,590
install of that so you want to go to

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,590
services plugins

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:46,400
yes yes no sorry that is your data set 1

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:51,000
so that's where the OS is going to go

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:56,490
you can just close that gel name you can

00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,300
give it anything and for the I what is

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:04,380
that we're putting you before you so

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:11,430
you're actually installing the jail the

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:13,530
jail yeah okay the IP address we were

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:20,240
trying about 21 in the hopes that is

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:20,240
free so of the same network yeah yeah

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:39,680
21 plus straight 21 and the subnet mask

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:43,010
was the 32 50 51 lat / 24 okay and that

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:55,430
one is the one called software it's

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:58,520
easier to browse to it yeah okay and

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,900
then you just upload and then you're

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,230
gonna have to browse to where where that

00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,230
is

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:19,280
so you want this one I don't want to end

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:22,390
some dot pbi I at much quicker just

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,390
dance right

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:40,720
so it took about 20 seconds

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:44,470
now if I can get back into his system

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,470
should already be installed

00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:17,549
yeah it takes a minute for it to finish

00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,549
and then it should disappear

00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:39,639
and I've lost my connection to you how

00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:49,599
convenient we may just all go and stare

00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:51,579
at his screen it's always the coolest

00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:53,289
part that you really want to show off

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,819
that you build up to the end of the day

00:12:53,289 --> 00:13:11,939
that's when you lose your connectivity

00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:14,979
so okay how many people were actually

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:18,849
actually installed it did use install

00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:20,679
Chris okay so we got 12 I'll walk

00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:22,479
through those two and we may just have

00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:27,299
to look at their screens if I can't get

00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:31,299
back into the system so once you have

00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:33,249
installed the plug-in jail if you now

00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,689
click on settings like you did to

00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:37,809
install it it's just going to show you

00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:40,269
what your settings are the jail itself

00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:42,639
you won't be able to access and still

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:45,850
use until you start to plug in jail

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:53,350
service so you go to services control

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:55,029
services yeah and if you scroll down and

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,850
that first part where all your core

00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:01,329
services are there will be a service

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,059
called plugins and you need to turn that

00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:07,239
on so what you do is you click the red

00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:10,769
off and it should turn to a blue on to

00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:10,769
indicate that the services started

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,680
correct no so the other tab will show

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,540
you the software you installed so the

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,400
plug-in is considered to be a core

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:29,410
service so it's under the core services

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:41,860
correct transmission flyer firefly mini

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:58,450
DLNA that is already built in buck man

00:14:41,860 --> 00:15:00,430
line only yep and we'll go see yes that

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,360
show what's your IP address on earth of

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,360
any better luck with yours

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,290
you're 169

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:55,840
okay so i still have an IEP and that's

00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,090
really buggy just the stuff you want to

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,220
show off okay so we do have two machines

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,470
that have the plugins jail installed so

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,520
you may have to huddle if you want to

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,520
see what it looks like okay

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,020
once you've started the plugins jail

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,750
service you can now go into the plugins

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,310
tab of services control services and

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,530
there will be an install plugin button

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,290
I've given you three PBIS to play with

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:39,470
if you click on the install plugin it

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,900
basically asks you to browse to the name

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,410
of the pbi that you'd like to install so

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:48,650
it's basically as easy as that so where

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:50,810
are you so he's going to install a

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,760
plug-in if anybody wants to see what it

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,750
looks like so he's just browsing to the

00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:59,840
location so your plug-in will always end

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:06,260
in a PB I extension so he's going to do

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:08,720
mini DLNA and basically you say upload

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:14,600
that's it that's it that's all it is to

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:18,940
installing it yeah and it's faster over

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,940
reliable Network yes much

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,170
yeah because it's still going through

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:46,300
your wireless interface to get there you

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:49,710
know it's on the local host yeah you

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,710
want to do that sure

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,600
pinned Albert I'd be lost

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,810
don't do that yet so one of the things i

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,750
do want to show you if you scroll down a

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,730
bit back to where you are in the plugins

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,250
you'll notice they also if you go to

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,890
where are we here actually i would

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,790
refresh because they should show up i

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:41,260
should show up on your plugins that

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:46,680
should do it so let's go back down where

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:50,740
it says plugins somebody man i think

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,750
there we go where did ya wonder why it's

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:59,200
not being added there it should be added

00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:03,150
there ok yeah i find it's really flaky

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,070
it takes a minute to search there you go

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,870
ok so if you want to install another

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,350
plugin for those that haven't seen a

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:13,750
plug-in install yet so he's in services

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,600
he's left the court a band he's in the

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,580
plugins tab he's already installed

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,380
transmission so it was automatically

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,010
added and now he's going to install a

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,010
different one

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,160
so it's just a simple matter of browsing

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,990
to it and saying uploading and it will

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,630
show your upload status while it's doing

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:44,760
that they're still there so you just

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:48,780
have to go back to services control

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:56,730
services oh yeah and it will always show

00:19:48,780 --> 00:20:00,410
on the plugins tab so we'll just wait

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,410
until that one gets installed out

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:15,800
so your plug-in service has started you

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:20,010
can go to services control services and

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,250
under core plugins good is showing us

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:25,500
out and now if you click on plugins

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:30,780
plugins tough for you yeah that's where

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,110
you install them yeah may have to

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,190
refresh that so typically this is

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,150
instantaneous when you don't have

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,150
networking issues

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:51,210
so right now if you do go do go to doc

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,269
free network we have more information

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,639
about the three PB is that are available

00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:00,450
so if you don't know what firefly mini

00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:02,490
DLNA or transmission art I don't use in

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,200
that often so I wrote it down once and

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,539
sort of dumped it but it's been

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,690
documented what they are and what you

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:12,240
can do with them once his screen

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,429
refreshes we won't install another one

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:23,220
will instead go and look at the services

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:26,220
good so if you want to go down on your

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,759
left tree frame and we'll take a look at

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:34,440
services plugins now why is it not

00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:38,090
adding them to that so we already have

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,990
the settings we already have management

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:45,059
they should be and it should be being

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,809
added to the tree and I don't see why

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,809
it's not doing that

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,740
no you should be on the left you can try

00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,780
refreshing but they should they should

00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:08,260
show up on the left hand side I don't

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:09,520
see why they're not doing that because

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,330
that's where you actually go in and

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:19,650
configure them I may not be able to show

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,650
you the pretty GUI yeah

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:33,460
I don't know why it's not adding it to

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,460
the tree okay do you know why

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,980
no if it wasn't on you wouldn't be able

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,980
to install a plugin

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,150
yeah so what happens is the first thing

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,380
you want to do when you see your plugins

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,300
there's you want to turn them on and

00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,920
don't do that because you have to

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,140
configure them first it'll just give you

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:09,510
an error it will probably say there's

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:12,630
something missing in your config yeah so

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,790
what we tell people is don't start the

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,620
service until you've configured it but

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,020
the problem is it's not putting it in

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,060
the configuration menu and I don't know

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,100
why I wonder if it's hanging at the end

00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,330
of the install because the internet is

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:29,370
so slow so right where he is now right

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,590
under management there should be an

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,050
entry called transmission and there

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,480
should be an entry called mini DLNA and

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:40,410
if you click on that you get the nice

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,330
GUI configuration screen and seeing that

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,740
was the one thing I wanted you guys to

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,480
get out of the course today because that

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,770
was really cool nobody's seen it yet

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:52,170
that's the one thing it's not showing up

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:54,240
but now I've already tested this at home

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,340
with reliable Network and it showed up

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,890
in the tree so I think it's just an

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:02,010
issue with the network I'm not sure

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:05,070
what's happening there so it's sort of

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:07,080
disappointing so what should happen is

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,500
you should have an entry called mini

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,480
DLNA being added to the plugins part of

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,250
the tree it should be right there you

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,680
should be able to click on it and it

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,420
allows you to set up say your torrents

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,450
where the directory is where the

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,550
torrents are going to live any sort of

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,160
authentication all the stuff that you

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,530
can do with mini DLNA and it should just

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,750
like look like any configuration screen

00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:37,290
with the options that are specific to

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:40,740
that application no no because that's

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,400
just your services so it's unfortunate

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,400
it's not doing that

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:57,560
it doesn't know so it's really

00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:00,560
disappointing that that screen isn't

00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,690
showing up as anybody had has any way

00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,470
been able to get their plug-in to show

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,700
up on the left frame in the tree so I

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,110
don't know if it's just hanging at the

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,820
last minute and that's why it's not

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,440
being added to the tree I'm not sure

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:18,020
what's what's happening there if you

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,210
want to click on management so i will

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,790
show you the mount point thing so if you

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,890
click Add mount point it's basically

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,930
asking you for a source in a destination

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:30,890
and there's no tooltips that really

00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:32,480
explain what it is so I want to make

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,830
sure I don't get it backwards because I

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,830
always get my mount points backwards

00:25:52,570 --> 00:26:01,220
and I'll actually show you do you have a

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,800
PDF reader on that thing do you mind

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,620
opening up that PDF and I'll show you

00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,910
what it's supposed to look like and then

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:15,500
we'll take a look at the mount points

00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:18,380
page 51 at the bottom and see and I took

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,620
the screen shot off of these PBIS I know

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,340
it works so it's just a problem with our

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,340
network here

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:38,440
so it's the figure underneath that so

00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:40,899
you'll notice in this one so this was

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,690
using the exact same iso the exact same

00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:46,239
PB is so I know they do work you'll

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,190
notice that i installed all three like

00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:51,070
you're seeing there you're added to the

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:55,210
control services right plane and on the

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:57,039
Left plane sorry the left tree that's

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,100
what you double-click on to configure

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,820
that service we do have a screen shot

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,529
though on page 52 of the Firefly

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,200
configuration GUI so we just

00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:11,559
double-click on Firefly and it looks

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,509
like any other freenas GUI so all of the

00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,210
options that are available in firefly

00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:19,299
you can set from there and you can take

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,889
a look at them once you've set those you

00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:23,109
then go in and start your firefly

00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:25,539
service and if it likes your

00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:29,859
configuration you've now configured

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:34,230
firefly the other thing that i want to

00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:34,230
show you go back to those mount points

00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:45,720
make sure I don't get this backwards so

00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:45,720
the source

00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:55,310
is a directory that lives outside of the

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:58,310
jail so for example if you need if you

00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:01,280
already have movies that you want to

00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,930
share by a torrent you can go to the

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,860
data set or the directory where they

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:09,520
reside and that will be the source so

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,870
you can just pick a data set that's fine

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,310
if you double click and then close it

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:19,370
will pick the data set and the

00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:22,730
destination is going to be a mount point

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:24,920
within the jail itself so you can say

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:31,660
we're in the jail do I want this to go

00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,660
and typically it will be say in / mount

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:42,350
and then do plugins pbi so let's say

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,320
transmission and then the mount point

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:49,100
within the transmission pbi so it will

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:54,980
actually make a basically a mount point

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:59,240
for that there you go you should be able

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,480
to close I should be able to do it there

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,480
you go

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:08,809
so whenever that application needs

00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:17,899
access to torrents it will get it

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:26,179
through that mountain point hey you get

00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:33,320
it right up yeah so it looks like it's

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:35,239
not uploading the whole thing yeah just

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,580
not it's not uploading the whole pbi

00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:39,830
that's why so that's why we're not

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,359
getting in the left frame once you get

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,710
home and you have reliable internet

00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,710
access it should just work

00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:14,470
okay so unfortunately that wasn't as

00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,360
exciting as I wanted it to be but you

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,720
guys off to use your imagination to get

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,030
home last thing i want to show you to do

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,630
how to do so that's going to be the

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:27,340
recommended way for installing PBIS and

00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,730
there's several reasons for that one is

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:33,250
quick and dirty it just works too it's

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,140
added to your services panel so you can

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,260
view the status of the service start and

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:41,320
stop it and it's also very easy to

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,390
configure through the GUI the one thing

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,210
that I can't show you today because we

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,300
don't have an update file is you can

00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:52,230
also update PBIS new versions become

00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:56,620
available so if you go back to your

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,920
services control services and into your

00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,220
plugins tab you'll notice next to each

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:08,500
pbi there is an update button and it

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:11,110
will simply ask you to choose the file

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,250
for the update the new version of the

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:17,740
pbi and once we have updates available

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,410
it will keep all of your configurations

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:24,250
it will just update your software so

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:26,920
it's recommended for that because the

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,470
plug-in architecture is so new for the

00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,770
first six months to a year there's going

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:35,740
to be a limited number of PBIS so we are

00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:39,550
documenting how to create pbi so users

00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:42,700
can make their own PBIS and hopefully

00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:45,100
users will make them and contribute them

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,110
and we'll be making PB is as well for

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,920
the most popular software we get asked

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:53,050
for until then if you need software you

00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,300
can still install it using one of the

00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:59,020
traditional freebsd ways because you

00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:01,930
really do have a jail and the only way

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:05,320
to access the freenas jail is through

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:07,360
web shell so usually those whose used

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,540
freebsd jails before you're probably

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,300
used to ssh inge to the IP address of

00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:16,060
the jail that will not work on freenas

00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,520
so the way the jails are set up is

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,980
they're not available through ssh

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,040
the only way to access the jail's from

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:32,770
web shell so if i can get you to open up

00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:35,230
web shell yeah you can't yeah so that

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,030
was part of the design and again it's

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:42,100
going to look crappy which I apologize

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:46,060
for so it's actually designed that you

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,830
go in using the jail the J exec command

00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:52,240
so you're not going to be able to see

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:57,910
very well we do have this in the PDF how

00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:00,640
to find your jail so if you type JLS it

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,790
will give you the ID of your jail which

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,330
will typically be Jail number one so it

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:10,660
will show is your jail ID you then use

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:14,650
the J exec command to access that jail

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:16,990
so if you type j exact space the number

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,750
of the jail so the number one and then

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:24,430
space and give it the name of your shell

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:29,740
so you can do slash bin bash or no do

00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:36,790
slash bin slash tcsh and that will give

00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:39,490
you a shell into the jail once you press

00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:42,040
enter your prompt will change to

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,470
indicate you're into jail you are no

00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,810
longer on the freeness system you're now

00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:51,370
into the freebsd operating system

00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:54,400
running on the jail there's two ways to

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:57,820
install software and i think we'll do

00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,790
this one from the PDF because it's

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:04,530
really hard to see through that so we'll

00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:04,530
start on page 55

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,550
so unless you're really familiar with

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,980
freebsd you may not even know what

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,260
software is available and what i

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:21,200
recommend people go to is a place called

00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:25,520
fresh ports and it's at fresh ports dot

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,649
work and i'm typically on that site at

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,460
least a dozen times a day and there's

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:35,300
actually a firefly firefox search plugin

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:38,149
for fresh ports and the URL to that said

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,310
the PDF so if you use firefox and you

00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,570
search for software a lot you can just

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:46,070
search in your plug in your search bar

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,950
one of the reasons why i like fresh

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,869
ports is a I want to see if software

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,940
exists so if you're looking for

00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:55,250
something in particular you can just

00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,660
type it into the search bar and it will

00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:01,280
tell you if it's been ported to freebsd

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:05,119
typically it will be because there's

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,790
over 26,000 applications so most open

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,950
source applications will run on freebsd

00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,950
and will show up at fresh boards yes

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:29,430
so this is the reason why jails are nice

00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,550
to be on a data set because you can

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:36,810
replicate and snapshot your data sets

00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:40,170
yeah correct so right now other than

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:42,090
doing the the data set thing there's not

00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,770
a mechanism for backing up the jail and

00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:49,410
that's something that will go in a

00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:51,180
future version typically the software

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,640
you're looking for will exist and there

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,280
will be multiple versions so you can go

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,869
in and see what the latest version is if

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,140
there's a development version whatever

00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,700
and it will give you that information

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,890
the other nice thing about fresh ports

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,440
especially if you're new to freebsd it

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,960
will tell you what commands you use to

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,790
install that piece of software so if

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,140
you're looking and you say oh I want

00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:17,550
openvpn 222 let's pretend that so latest

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,610
version it's been a while since I've

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:25,170
taken that screenshot it tells you to

00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:28,500
install it type PKG underscore ad hyphen

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:32,490
our openvpn so it tells you the command

00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,710
that you use when you use the PKG

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,700
underscore add command you are

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:41,700
installing a precompiled binary so it's

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,220
going to be a very quick install unless

00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,980
it's a huge piece of software like KDE

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,470
or something or OpenOffice it typically

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,660
takes a couple of seconds to install it

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:54,990
and then it will just be there so it's

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:58,170
very quick if you're not used to soft go

00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:59,520
on freebsd package ed knows where to go

00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:03,210
so you don't have to set up your

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,270
repositories and packaged ad also knows

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,580
what's installed on your system and if

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:11,790
any dependencies are missing it will

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,240
automatically install them for you so

00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:18,480
you'll see in this example there is a

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:22,400
dependency called LZ 0 2 which didn't

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:26,369
exist on the system so grab that as well

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,410
once you have performed the installation

00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:31,590
you just get your prompt back so that's

00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:33,930
a good thing it means it worked and you

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:37,110
can verify that its installed by using

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,990
the PKG underscore info command

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:44,130
so I gave an example for that and it

00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:47,910
shows what got installed we go on to the

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:51,690
next page typically it's always nice to

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:54,450
know what you actually installed and we

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:58,710
can again query the package database by

00:37:54,450 --> 00:38:01,350
using pkg info and if you do a hyphen

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,670
Big L that says list what got installed

00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:08,580
I always use X because i'm too lazy to

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:11,850
type the full name of the software plus

00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:14,160
the version number so it basically does

00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,870
a string so it says show me everything

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,810
that got installed with anything that

00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:21,780
looks like openvpn and it will show you

00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:24,030
the whole list of what got installed you

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,880
can pipe that to grep so if you just

00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:29,150
want to see the binary then if you just

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,130
want to see the man pages grep man

00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,340
config files you can grab that see it'll

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:39,120
give you an idea of what got installed

00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:42,330
in freebsd anything that you install

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:45,420
yourself will always get installed to us

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:48,210
our local so that's how the OS is set up

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,480
it separates what came with the OS from

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,760
what you installed yourself so if you

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,660
install something look for it in us our

00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,750
local you'll find your bins in USR local

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:04,140
bin system by Nuri's will be us our

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:09,360
local Espen config files us our local at

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:14,760
sea and so on ok help go down the next

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:17,970
page so typically installing softwares

00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,640
is easy as that go to fresh port see if

00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:22,740
it exists fresh ports will tell you the

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,220
package add command install it and

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:30,690
you're good to go the one thing about

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,270
installing not using the plugins PBIS is

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,250
that you are going to have to manually

00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,440
configure it so you're going to have to

00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,900
figure out what's the config file what

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,760
do i edit into it you're gonna have to

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:47,520
start the service yourself because it's

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:49,830
not going to show up in the GUI ok and

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,640
we are at the end of this I'll show you

00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:54,060
how to start this

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,360
service sometimes you don't want to use

00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,220
pkg add you actually want to use the

00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,180
porch you want to compile it yourself

00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,860
and typically you don't want to do this

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,200
compiling a port takes time and

00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,360
depending upon the size of the software

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,940
can take a lot of time and you're

00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,970
basically watching make messages go by

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,400
while the port installs itself and it

00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,590
compiles and depending on how big the

00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,170
compile is it might even put a bit of a

00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:24,930
load on your system whereas package hat

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:27,600
is quick and dirty there are times so

00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:30,900
that you need to or want to compile the

00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:35,370
port and a couple of times reasons that

00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:39,300
you would want to do that is some ports

00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:41,820
have options that you can compile in you

00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,550
can find out what the options are from

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,510
fresh ports it'll tell you that port has

00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:51,690
any options and what fresh port tells

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:54,840
you is on by default is what comes with

00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:58,230
the package so if you're for example

00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,320
installing apache and you need certain

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:04,290
things to be compiled in if it's showing

00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,240
as off at fresh ports it means the

00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,670
package isn't going to do it for you if

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,900
you actually want those options you're

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,800
going to have to compile the port

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:16,200
yourself because packages always use

00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:21,270
what shows at fresh ports to default

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,040
options and that's typically the reason

00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,230
why we would take the time to compile a

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,300
port but the only other time is

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,180
sometimes a package is not available

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,970
even though a poor is and usually when

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,250
that happens it's for a licensing reason

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,310
we're not allowed to distribute you have

00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:40,430
to compile it yourself and occasionally

00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,530
it's because of a security vulnerability

00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,360
we don't want to expose users to that

00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,910
but if you want to compile it and run it

00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,160
go for it so use you want to see what

00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,960
the reason is and fresh ports will tell

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,970
you that it will have a skull and

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,040
crossbones if there's a security

00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,380
vulnerability and it will have a

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,540
restricted or if it's restricted for

00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,319
licensing reasons so you get a lot of

00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,039
information

00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:08,729
fresh sports when I tell people is if a

00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:11,549
package is available and there isn't any

00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:14,880
options that are missing just use a

00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:16,769
package otherwise you're wasting you

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,479
know load on your system compiling to

00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:24,559
port in this example we're continuing

00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:27,690
with Oakland via or with openvpn and

00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,869
fresh ports told us that there are two

00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,469
options available both of which are

00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,239
turned off so don't come in the package

00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:38,699
so if either of those two things were

00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:43,469
important to me I would instead want to

00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:45,690
compile the port before you can compile

00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:48,089
a port you have to grab something called

00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,999
the ports collection and the quickest

00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:52,799
way to do that is to use port snap so I

00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:56,579
give the command that you use to fetch

00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:59,009
it and extract it into your jail and it

00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,410
does take a while because it's about 600

00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:06,390
megs so the port's collection is pretty

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:09,449
big if you already have the port's

00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:11,549
collection and it's been more than a

00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:14,579
couple of days and you want to compile

00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:16,410
some melts it doesn't hurt to update

00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:20,999
your ports collection to make sure you

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:23,729
have the latest ports the command that

00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:26,400
you use to compile fresh ports will tell

00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:29,699
you what it is so it will tell you what

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,469
directory to CD into and that will be

00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,559
the directory that contains the makefile

00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:37,920
to make that port and then you just

00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,910
issue the make install command and it

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,650
will make it for you if the port has

00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,619
options you're going to get a little

00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,599
menu and you'll notice you can sorry to

00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,779
tell it's the same two options that

00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,880
fresh ports warned us came with that so

00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:56,459
this is where you go in and you change

00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:01,499
the options and you continue with the

00:43:56,459 --> 00:44:03,839
compile okay depending upon the size it

00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:07,229
will take its time compiling and when

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,619
it's done it will still show up in PKG

00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:13,289
info so the package database doesn't

00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,130
care how you installed it it will still

00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:18,930
let you know if it

00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:20,849
installed and what came with it last

00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,130
thing I want to sand this subject is how

00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:28,549
do I actually start a service if I

00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:32,279
installed it with packages and ports so

00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:35,309
your config file is typically going to

00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:37,829
live in us our local XE depending upon

00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:39,809
the package report sometimes they put it

00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:43,680
in a little deeper so it may be

00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:46,170
something like us our local openvpn etsy

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,710
I hope it will always be under us our

00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:52,440
local you're going to have to go in and

00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,660
figure out how to do the config file

00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,700
yourself so at that point you may be

00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,490
reading the man pages that came with the

00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,950
software or going to the website for the

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:06,299
application itself to figure out how do

00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:08,549
i configure openvpn once you think your

00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:11,309
config file is good and you want to test

00:45:08,549 --> 00:45:13,680
to see if the service starts you're

00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:16,380
going to use the startup script that

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,339
came with the software you will always

00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,970
find these in USR local etsy RC that d

00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:26,339
and whatever startup script will

00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:31,230
typically have a name that matches the

00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:33,809
application you installed now freebsd is

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:36,450
designed that unless you've told it to

00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:39,480
start a service at boot time it won't

00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,430
start the service unless you tell i just

00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,460
want to do it this one time because i'm

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,170
testing my configuration so typically

00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,880
when you start a service you give the

00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,549
name of the script and you say start

00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:54,089
when you're testing your config you say

00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:56,609
one start this is a one time if all goes

00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:59,490
well you get a message that says it

00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:01,890
started it rather than an error and you

00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,869
can double check it using the one status

00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,259
command and it will tell you if it's

00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:10,440
listening or not you can also use a sock

00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:14,009
stat command I use typhoon for to check

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,490
the IP version 4 socket and it says yep

00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:21,750
I have a process ID and it tells me what

00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:24,990
poor it's listening on if you get an

00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:27,420
error what you're going to have to do is

00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,089
go into your viral log messages to try

00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,559
I to figure out what it didn't like

00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:33,630
typically it's a typo in your config

00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:37,440
file or you forgot to put supplement it

00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:39,150
and you'll have to fix that what you're

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,890
going to want to do is once the service

00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,530
starts and everything is working the way

00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:47,369
you want it to do you need to tell your

00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:49,380
jail that if the jail ever stops I want

00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:52,170
you to start this service automatically

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,799
for me how you do that on a freebsd

00:46:52,170 --> 00:47:00,290
system is we have a config file called

00:46:55,799 --> 00:47:03,960
etsy RC calm and you put a line in there

00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:06,020
telling it to start your service and if

00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,440
you just want to scroll up a little bit

00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:11,700
so where it says openvpn enable

00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,150
typically the line will be the name of

00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:19,890
the application underscore enable equals

00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:21,839
yes and camps some software the name

00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,700
will be a little different so for

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,369
example for a patch it might be

00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,160
something like Apache 22 to specify the

00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:31,740
version of apache if you're not sure

00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,170
what the name of the service is if you

00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:37,980
read it startup script it will always

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:39,690
tell you what to put in RC calm and if

00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,809
you scroll down a bit we should it

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:49,010
should tell us what we do so it says to

00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:51,569
put in where to go might be up a bit

00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:53,400
yeah so this one's not as friendly it

00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:55,410
says a name enable which means you have

00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,470
to read up to see what the name is and

00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,940
it says the name is open VPN but the

00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,650
reason why they did it that way is

00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:08,339
because you can have multiple instances

00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:12,059
and start each instance okay so that's

00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:18,030
how you do it in the jail until there's

00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:20,970
a PB I available so that was a lot of

00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:24,569
information it's more detailed in the

00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:27,210
PDF and also a dock top freenas or

00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:29,849
there's more documentation still so if

00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:34,349
you need more help on freebsd ports or

00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:36,089
packages yeah that's like you the last

00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:37,640
screen that i wanted to show so again

00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:42,660
this is in your PDF

00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,880
where to go for more information what

00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,700
we've done with FreeNAS starting in

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,299
eight is every single version has its

00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:54,329
own guide that goes with it FreeNAS

00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:59,549
eight is new which means everything has

00:48:54,329 --> 00:49:01,559
changed between versions so for whatever

00:48:59,549 --> 00:49:03,059
version that you're running make sure

00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,059
that you download the correct

00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,529
documentation set or else the screens

00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:09,450
are not going to look like what you're

00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:13,799
seeing so things have really changed

00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:16,819
between versions the documentation is

00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:20,339
created on a wiki so anyone is welcome

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:24,150
to create a wiki account and to improve

00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:26,509
the documentation what is on the wiki

00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:29,700
now is what will be for the next version

00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:32,099
so once we release the software version

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,140
we cut the documentation and we publish

00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:37,470
it and make it available for download

00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,990
any changes after that go into the next

00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,200
version of the documentation so we try

00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:45,239
to keep it as up-to-date as possible

00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,940
there is a very active forums and

00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:52,499
there's all kinds of stuff there we can

00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:54,660
ask more community related stuff so if

00:49:52,499 --> 00:49:56,400
you are purchasing hardware and you want

00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,650
someone to look at you know what you're

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,160
thinking of doing into my comments on it

00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:04,589
there's a lot of posts like that there's

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,829
not as many as I'd like that there's

00:50:04,589 --> 00:50:09,900
getting to be more how to's and I know

00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:12,269
that once people start playing with

00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,249
plugins there'll be all kinds of how

00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:16,230
to's for every piece of software you

00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:18,599
could think of putting on your FreeNAS

00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,730
system so how to do that and we

00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,920
encourage people to create those how

00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,569
to's so if you figured out something

00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,140
really cool to do with your free net

00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:30,420
system make a how-to so other people can

00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:34,499
try it too and see what cool stuff you

00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:36,960
can do we do have mailing lists there's

00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:39,210
development mailing lists there's

00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,849
translation mailing lists documentation

00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:44,099
so there is quite a few there are

00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:46,619
instructional videos and there's links

00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,330
to them there's some at YouTube and

00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:50,790
there's also been a

00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:53,940
what's the name of those people there to

00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:56,730
something they do a lot of Linux shows

00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,550
they've done a series on freenas so

00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:01,980
there's links for that as well and if

00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:04,200
you want your question answered quickly

00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:08,370
the best thing to do is to hop on IRC

00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,920
and ask it and it's not so bad for

00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:13,650
people who live in North America but we

00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,900
always have to remind people that there

00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,640
may be a lot of people on channel but it

00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,920
may be three o'clock in the morning when

00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,740
you asked your question so don't just

00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,650
pop in ask your question get mad

00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:28,050
disappear within five minutes if you ask

00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,940
the question it will be answered it may

00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:32,490
be five hours later when someone wakes

00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:37,320
up and looks at the history but someone

00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:40,020
will answer your question okay we doing

00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,970
for time that's good four times you want

00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,130
to give Chris a chance to set up make

00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:48,270
sure is computer works for the projector

00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:51,360
in that so those of you that don't have

00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:55,110
a copy of the the course materials

00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:57,810
you'll want to grab a USB drive thumb

00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,790
drive and if we're short on those those

00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,800
of you that have laptops if you can copy

00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:06,120
it over so we can make sure everybody

00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,970
has a copy of the PB is the ISO and the

00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:12,120
course documents so you can play with

00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:14,220
the stuff on your own the stuff that we

00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,070
use today is the latest and greatest

00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:20,370
which hopefully will be obsolete next

00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:23,210
week when beta 4 comes out but until

00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:27,110
then but this is a good one to play with

00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,110
okay so thanks everyone

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:32,030
you

00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:40,670
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,619
ago we could not have imagined that

00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:44,840
asterisk would not only become the most

00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:46,970
widely adopted open source communication

00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,010
software on the planet but that it would

00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:51,530
impact the entire industry in the way

00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:53,510
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:56,150
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:58,100
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:00,200
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,580
transition of power from the hands of

00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,859
the traditional proprietary phone

00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,260
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:08,210
administrators of phone systems using

00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,440
this power our customers have created

00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,359
all sorts of business changing

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,220
applications from small office phone

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,740
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,330
the international carrier networks in

00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,130
fact there's even an entire country

00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:21,740
those communications infrastructure runs

00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,660
on Astra's the gym has always been about

00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,369
creating technology that expands

00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,530
communications capabilities in ways that

00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,730
we could never have imagined and that's

00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,490
part of what's game-changing about

00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,830
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:35,900
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:38,030
IP phones that extends control of the

00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,770
user all the way to the desktop the

00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:41,510
launch of these new products represents

00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,580
the next phase indigenous history of

00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:46,010
innovation these are the first and only

00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,690
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:49,250
power of esters when we first discussed

00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,290
our expectations for building a family

00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:53,450
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:55,190
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:56,810
the team to build the phones such that

00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:59,030
they were easy to install integrate

00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,859
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:03,440
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:05,060
that goal user feedback is validating

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,160
that when it comes to operation with

00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,590
astro space systems including our own

00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,170
Switchvox based product these are the

00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,490
easiest to use best integrated most

00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:16,070
interoperable products on the market

00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,040
today the digitally phones will

00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:20,119
initially include three IP des hommes

00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,040
uniquely designed to complement any

00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,930
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,600
these phones are different for a number

00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:29,240
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,680
designed for use with esters secondly

00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,290
we've made it really easy to

00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,670
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,380
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:38,060
to access information inside of

00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,820
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,310
between the

00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:43,020
application and the phone additionally

00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,510
we've created an applications engineer

00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:47,700
that allows users and developers to

00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:50,460
create and run their own apps on the

00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,530
phone and finally we've done all of this

00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,270
at a very compelling price point at

00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,460
Digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:58,830
give our customers the best value in

00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,120
business phone systems and also give

00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,220
them the power to create their own

00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,020
solutions or any communications

00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,700
challenge well continue to push the

00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,470
boundaries not only to make Astra's

00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,330
cooler faster and more technologically

00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,790
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:13,110
communications even easier and together

00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:16,310
we'll change the way the world

00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,310
communication again

00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:04,490
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:06,650
way to better utilize all your resources

00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:10,100
and it makes managing all your resources

00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:13,930
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:17,450
happening in open source the

00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:19,250
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,170
of the community and the speed at which

00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:23,360
these are these you know these

00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:25,610
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,250
discovered and then fixed is it I think

00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:30,950
that really shows the power of the you

00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:32,600
know of the open source community it is

00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:36,800
global and it's definitely because of

00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:43,130
the users community people are extremely

00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:44,870
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,300
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:48,440
these guys helping each other out and

00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:51,350
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,180
manner the product is transparent for

00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:57,200
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:59,390
base everyone can see how close that is

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:05,270
being built nothing nothing is

00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:07,910
proprietary everything is open in many

00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:12,110
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:15,890
ongoing health cloudstack the most

00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:19,700
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:22,430
was our first developer boot camp

00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:25,070
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:29,030
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:33,230
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:36,050
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:38,570
chairs into the room twice everything

00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:41,930
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:44,900
is open source and so I don't think that

00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:46,640
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:49,700
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,250
computing and so i think it's i think

00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,750
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,859
about cloud computing you're really

00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:00,410
talking about open source cloud

00:57:54,859 --> 00:58:03,470
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:05,599
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:09,859
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:12,530
in each data centers these Hardware is

00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:16,040
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:18,740
to handle number one that mass scale

00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:21,920
number two it's designed to handle the

00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:24,740
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:28,970
deployments started working on cod tech

00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:32,240
over four years ago and it was the

00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:34,010
original set of people working on it and

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:38,119
a background of delivering software

00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:41,770
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:45,980
lots of users actually using it

00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:49,040
availability is a key feature multiple

00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:51,079
hypervisors support different network

00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,750
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:56,000
you better well step management server

00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:59,690
can be deployed in different physical

00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,369
machines it definitely has a huge

00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:05,470
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:08,380
there's a major movie studio that

00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:11,890
they were using CloudStack they were

00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:13,420
using it to transcode video and i

00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,400
thought that was terribly fascinating

00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,470
what i found more fascinating is what

00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,190
they did during lunch where they would

00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:22,660
spin up you know 50 or 60 game servers

00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,490
then as soon as lunch was over they

00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,160
would destroy all the instances and get

00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:29,800
back to doing real work CloudStack is

00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,480
vast it touches so many different

00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,340
aspects and there's no one person that's

00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:37,000
kind of like a master of all those

00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:39,880
realms I think cloudstack as a project

00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,160
is going to be one of the leaders simply

00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:47,050
because it's some of the most feature

00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:51,280
pullin and and robust platforms I hope

00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:53,849
they learn Adam senior living through

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,849
