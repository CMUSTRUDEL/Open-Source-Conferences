the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,410

linux fest visit www.lend expense org

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,279
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:32,520
possible ok we're ready ok so we'll

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,770
continue the just an overview of what's

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,350
possible in the GUI before we start

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,110
getting into an actual configuration

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,379
workflow so we're back into the system

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,739
settings and this is basically the

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,829
settings money the settings that control

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,530
the whole freenas system one of the

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,559
things you can do by default your web

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,660
connection will be HTTP you can change

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:03,420
that to https so your configuration is

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,920
over an encrypted connection if you do

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,540
that you're going to want to go to the

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,420
ssl tab and this is a beta version so

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,610
it's not showing it an SSL certificate

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,439
should already be generated for you and

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,990
showing there but that will be an

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,270
unsigned certificate if you have your

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,430
own signed certificate you just paste it

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,299
in that box and that's what will be used

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,439
for your HTTPS connection if we go back

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:35,490
to General of the web GUI address if you

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,880
have multiple interfaces in the freenas

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,159
system and you want to tie down the

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,490
administrative control to one interface

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,149
for example your internal interface you

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:51,210
can select that from the drop-down menu

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:54,030
by default it is set to the wild card of

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,460
all zeros which means it will listen for

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,049
connections and all your interfaces so

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,299
for example you don't want people coming

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,070
in on the public interface you can tie

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,750
it down to the administrative interface

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,270
another thing you can do for security by

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,670
defaults just going in either by poor 80

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,150
or 443 depending on whether you're using

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,599
HTTP or east

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,860
GPS you can change the web GUI port that

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:25,209
you go into to administer the system if

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:29,709
you are using a localized version of

00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:32,500
freeness these are all the localizations

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,329
that are available for the menus before

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,879
you do that you'll want to check the

00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:40,209
status of your localization at poodle

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,180
doubt free network what happens is if

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,730
the language is not a hundred percent

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,909
translated the untranslated menu

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,849
sections will display in English so if

00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:54,459
you're only getting partial in your

00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,829
language that's the reason why and we

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,099
encourage people if you care about a

00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:02,579
fully localized language if you can

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:06,700
contribute the missing menu strings

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:10,389
using the poodle interface one of the

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:13,000
things that was just added was a console

00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:14,639
keyboard map so for those of you that

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,260
aren't using an English keyboard

00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,849
actually do have a lot of users in other

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,030
parts of the world so you can pick out

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:25,000
your keyboard layout you can set your

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,299
time zone the other thing that a lot of

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,849
users will notice and it depends upon

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:36,549
how you lay out your system by default

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:39,129
the logs I'll go into bar which is on a

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,859
memory so you actually lose your logs of

00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,780
the system reboots and that can be

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,629
really irritating if you are

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,129
troubleshooting why system is panicking

00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,629
or freezing because you're not going to

00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:52,930
be able to see your logs to see what

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:55,629
happened if that's the case or if you

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:59,199
prefer to have your log sent to another

00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:02,019
server on the network if you have a

00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:05,379
syslog d server running you just simply

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,930
input the IP address at this point only

00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,840
syslog D is supported so you do need

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,389
some sort of UNIX system running syslog

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,250
d but then it's just a simple matter of

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,250
inputting the IP address yes

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,970
yes definitely yeah and I'll show you

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,030
that when we get to the networking

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:35,220
section so this is your general settings

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,870
in advanced by default that console menu

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,320
that we saw when I was trying to set up

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,110
my IP address that will display you can

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,510
turn that off so it doesn't display but

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,830
you'll want to have alternate ways of

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,260
getting into the system you can enable

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,750
power D what else we got the console

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:59,100
messages the other thing that happens

00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,770
and this can be handy if you are writing

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,220
a ticket so we do have a track system

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,850
where people can submit tickets for bugs

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,920
by default if there is a bug in the de

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,070
Django code and you try to do something

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,030
that it doesn't like it will I'll pop up

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,620
a menu with the traceback so if you're

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,360
experiencing that just copy and paste it

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,910
into your ticket and they can usually

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,510
tell pretty quickly where the problem is

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,460
and how to fix it that auto to think

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,820
auto-tune thing that I mentioned is

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:36,810
disabled by default if you turn it on

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,060
auto tune is designed to run at boot

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,980
time which means you'll have to reboot

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,200
the system in order for it to probe your

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,840
hardware and to change some of your

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,850
settings and in a minute when we do

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,580
 tl's I'll show you where those

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,840
settings I get set so that you can look

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,120
to see what auto tuned into your system

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,340
we have a couple of buttons down here so

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,560
if you are dealing with active directory

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:08,040
or openldap em and you and a need and a

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,530
new user is added to the database that

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,530
user won't show up until the next day

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,620
when a cron job runs to update all that

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,630
stuff if you need that user now you come

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,790
in and you click that button and it will

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,410
synchronize with the domain controller

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,330
this is a handy one this one's called

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,000
safe debug it's probably not gonna look

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,230
exciting if I click on it

00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,390
that's assuming you'll see i'll see how

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,850
Internet's going to go if you are

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,300
submitting a support ticket one of the

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,340
things you can do is click on this it

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,440
will create a text file that will have

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,660
all kinds of information such as your

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:53,330
freenas revision your log files all

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,760
kinds of stuff so it's very easy to

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,980
create one of those and it will have a

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,640
lot of debugging information for the

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,680
developers when I show you how to

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,500
upgrade this is where you go to upgrade

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,990
so basically you download that file that

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,360
had the name upgrade in it you click on

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,150
firmware upgrade we have made a volume

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,320
yet so we can't apply an update so we'll

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:20,930
do an update once we have a volume the

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,900
other thing you can do if you already

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,200
have a plug ins jail and you do an

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,090
upgrade you should come in and import

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,220
your plugins shale and that will put it

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:38,380
back in the GUI so all of your settings

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:38,380
will show back up in the GUI yep

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,730
okay this party will also sit down

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,210
and you've had good luck with it we get

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,440
so many complaints from people that says

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,930
it didn't do what they thought it would

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:08,930
do but I'm glad to hear somebody had

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:11,420
good luck with it email this isn't where

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,490
you set the email address for the root

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,790
user that receives the administrative

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:20,270
alerts on that instead this is where you

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:23,660
actually set your email settings so this

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:26,540
is the address that the system will send

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,840
the email as so where the email appears

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:33,320
to come from you can set your outgoing

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:38,120
mail server and your port numbers we do

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:41,150
support ssl and smt off and you can put

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,430
in that configuration information you

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:47,110
can also send a test email to make sure

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,790
that your email is working correctly and

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,000
SSL is basically where you go in and you

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:56,180
set your certificate for this will be

00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,320
used for https connections and for

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:06,320
secure ftp so CTLs is interesting so

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,330
anybody who's familiar with freebsd will

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,730
know that we have a mechanism called sis

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,690
CTL is typically used at the command

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,900
line linux has it as well but doesn't

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,480
use it as often as freebsd does so

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,810
freebsd is used quite often and it's

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,660
used to tune a running system so the

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,320
point of TL is it will tell you

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:33,410
basically everything that the colonel

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,070
understands and is doing and it I can

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:42,460
actually show you on the system because

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,460
this is freebsd base TL

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,459
so I just asked for all of the TLS

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,730
and what you get is something called

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:59,339
mibs so almost like an SNMP where you

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,170
have your o IDs these r dot limited so

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,629
basically this is everything about the

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,990
kern and you have various mibs for the

00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:10,079
colonel there's actually millions of

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:14,339
these so we got the cam subsystem the

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:17,009
GOM subsystem at some point we'll hit

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,610
the networking stuff so it can just let

00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,499
go on forever we got colonel features we

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,079
got the options that were built into the

00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:30,029
kernel we got all of the devices that

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:32,850
the colonel understands we got the

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:36,029
virtual memory system so basically there

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,870
are literally thousands of mibs that

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:41,790
describe what's happening on that system

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,680
typically if you are tuning a freebsd

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,689
based system you're going through

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,769
something like the freebsd handbook or

00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:52,199
some sort of how to and it will say to

00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:54,329
bump up ZFS performance if say if you

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:57,029
have low ram you should set the these

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:59,879
CTL parameters and you could should set

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,189
them to these values and typically what

00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,240
you do is you test it on a test system

00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:09,029
first to see how the system reacts when

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,079
you change the value so as soon as you

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:15,180
set assists CTL the colonel starts doing

00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,660
whatever it is that you asked for that

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:23,850
nib so it's how you tune a live running

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:26,970
system typically if a freebsd based

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,519
system we just run the CTL command we

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,439
give it the name of the mid and we give

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,629
it the value that we want to set it to

00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:36,990
and it shows that it said it from this

00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,240
value to that value here we get a nice

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,660
pretty GUI where you can go in and do

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,769
that so here you would type in the mid

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,170
name so turned on I PC dot whatever you

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:52,949
would type in whatever value you want to

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,080
go into that CTL you have the option to

00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,820
write in a comment

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,270
do you remember why you change this

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,900
value and if you're playing around with

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:07,220
Tunney you can enable or disable that

00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:10,160
value while you're doing it the nice

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,040
thing is any tl's that you set

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,460
will be listed here it also what the

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,300
values are if you run that Autotune

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:24,110
script if it changes any TL values

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,330
they will show up there and if what

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,390
auto-tune thought would work for your

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,400
system isn't working for your system you

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,640
would go in and edit that value and

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,690
change change it's a numeric value so

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,520
that's how we do TLS I'm going to

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,760
jump down to two new bulls because tuna

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,250
bowls are sort of the same so on a

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,820
freebsd system we have a file called

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,010
bootloader calm and that file is read to

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,980
determine if any additional drivers

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,040
should be loaded and also if you want to

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,160
load specific kernel modules to add

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,190
support for things this one gives you a

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,170
GUI where you can do the same thing so

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,170
for example if you have a piece of

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,810
hardware and that driver is not loaded

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,400
by default you can write down the name

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:18,380
of the loader comp variable and

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,270
typically the value will be the word yes

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,760
and capitals because you're basically

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:26,600
saying yes I want you to load this

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,460
driver this module dirt boot up again

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,080
you can write a comment so you remember

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:35,420
why and any tuna bowls or loaders that

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,090
you add will be listed at their values

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,970
so you can know what additional things

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,550
you're loading on that system again

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:48,290
autotune if it changes a loader value

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,240
for you it decides that something melt

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:56,420
should be loaded to support your

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:58,820
hardware it will be listed here and you

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,830
can change that if it's not working for

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,860
you I don't know why we're getting

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,510
feedback today okay so those are your

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:14,630
sis CTLs

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:16,820
and tuna bowls the other thing the last

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,390
thing in system is your system

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,600
information and it basically gives you

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,670
information about your build a lot of

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,770
people especially on the forums in IRC

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,500
will ask some what version of freenas

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,420
are you running and they usually tell us

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,780
the FreeBSD version because they look at

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:39,890
you name that doesn't help us we really

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,690
need to know your revision number and if

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,020
you're running a release we need to know

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:48,250
things like it's 80 for p2 and not just

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,490
80 for release because things do change

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:55,130
between versions especially if you are

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,480
debugging stuff a lot of features get

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:01,820
fixed between versions so at your system

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,790
we take a look at networking FreeNAS

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:08,330
supports a lot of cool networking stuff

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,880
we do have a global configuration by

00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:14,480
default you're going to get a hostname

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,930
in a domain and by default your FreeNAS

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,570
system is not available from an external

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,130
network and that's by design you don't

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,400
want just anybody coming in and playing

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,610
with your free nav system that does mean

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,830
if you need to access your system from

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,260
another subnet in your internal network

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,910
or from the internet you're going to

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,640
have to go in and set the gateway and

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,250
dns information it's not going to work

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,620
until you do that so by default is

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,620
designed to just be on your local subnet

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,720
interfaces it will show you what

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:56,000
interfaces have been defined and

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,590
typically for adding an interface what

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,520
we're really doing is we're adding

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:04,310
aliases so by default it will probe all

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,190
of your real interfaces but you can add

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,110
virtual interfaces that's part of your

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,370
requirement so typically that's what we

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,790
use is screen for

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:17,350
we do have linked aggregations and

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,600
you're not going to have fun with link

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,600
aggregations if your router does not

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,339
support lacp because most of the link

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:30,690
aggregation protocols it's at 80 to 1 q

00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:35,589
no a bee it's one of the 802 dot ones

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:38,410
yeah a B and usually you're going to

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,720
need some sort of lacp support on it at

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,850
the very least you're going to need 1a b

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,860
support on the router so it's not going

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:49,259
to be a home Soho router it's going to

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:53,440
be you know commercial grade router

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:55,440
there are various algorithms that are

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,139
supported and if you go to the

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,170
documentation it describes the features

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:09,059
of each type of algorithm and what's

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:11,770
required network summary will show you

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:17,020
basically all of your interfaces and how

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:19,630
they're currently set up static routes

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,089
if you do need to reach other parts of

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,159
your network by default you're limited

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,839
to your local subnet so if you need to

00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:28,209
add routes you can just go in and add

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:37,059
the name of the network and the Gateway

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:41,890
that you use to get there and vlans we

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:44,409
do have the lien support obviously your

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:47,380
router is going to have to already be

00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:49,690
set up or your router bridge for the

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,000
vlans you're going to have to have

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:56,320
already created your VLAN tag in your

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,049
network and you can come in here and you

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:05,610
put the tag so that can participate in

00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:08,760
the VLAN network so it's networking

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:11,110
storage we're going to play a lot with

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,080
because basically that's the whole point

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,419
of an ass we'll be talking about

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,690
periodic snapshot tasks and replication

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:23,909
tasks as well as all the things you can

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,909
do with your volumes and your scrubs

00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:33,740
sharing the three main types of sharing

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:36,799
are going to be for Mac unix and windows

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,460
networks and we'll be talking more about

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,960
those in the configurational review and

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,770
the last thing I want to show you is the

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:51,260
services these are all the services that

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,730
are built into freenas and one of the

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,950
things that's going to be different in

00:18:52,730 --> 00:19:00,440
this tab on an 82 system this is where

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,570
we go in and start our services and by

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,740
default all services are off until you

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:09,260
start them the services that come with

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,360
the corn as are going to be listed under

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:17,270
core and as you start installing plugins

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,610
the software that you install will be

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:23,720
added to the plugins tab so you can go

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:28,120
in and start and stop those services so

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,120
that you won't see on a pre 82 system

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,289
sorry

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,320
right now there's you have to be in the

00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:40,620
eighth 2 series which is still made up

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,480
the latest beta was beta 3 and don't use

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,880
it because it's changed since then the

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,179
plugins don't work so you can use the

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:55,590
ice so I gave you today or the eighth 2

00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:57,809
beta 4 which is due out next week yes

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,000
which is what we're doing so we have

00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,490
something called Knightley's where the

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,529
the changes are integrated each night

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,159
for the upcoming release and you can

00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:09,990
download that from sourceforge as well

00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:14,880
now the nice thing about coming to a

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,789
course before we have a beta 4 is the

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,500
new plugins are still being tested so

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:20,789
they're not online yet so you're like

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,390
the first people in the world to play

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:29,789
with them so as well that's why you come

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:32,730
to events like this the chorus services

00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:34,919
if you have active directory in your

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,179
network you're going to have to tell it

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:44,190
some information about your PDC so it

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:47,640
can import those users if you've created

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:50,010
sift shares nothing happens and still

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,470
you till you start the sift service and

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,380
you should take a look at the defaults

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,029
if service settings first to make sure

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,870
it matches your network in your

00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:05,130
requirements and we'll talk a little bit

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:08,460
about those for home users typically not

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:11,789
seen so much in the workplace we do have

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:15,149
support for dynamic dns so you basically

00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:18,750
tell it who your provider is and the

00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:21,090
docs do have ways to tell you how to add

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:25,200
a provider that doesn't show in the drop

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:32,309
down menu so if you're using ddns you

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:34,260
can configure it for that ftp who all

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,570
plays with I scuzzy or has ever played

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,539
with ice guzzi yeah so there's a

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,950
boatload of terminology that you have to

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:43,710
sort of wrap your head around and

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,100
there's a whole bunch of steps to set up

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,700
by

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,070
guzzi basically the order that you see

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,260
here is the order that makes most sense

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,960
when you're setting up your I scuzzy on

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,330
a freenas system and we can go through

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,960
that and the configuration workflow if

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,910
anybody's interested if you're trying to

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,900
integrate with an ldap network you're

00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,270
going to have to give some information

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,390
about the ldap server so it can find it

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:12,690
if you've made NFS shares you're going

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,549
to need to start the NFS service this is

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,120
where we'll be adding our plugins this

00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:22,919
afternoon I will be doing a test our

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,840
sink if you have set up smart tests they

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,789
don't run until you start the smart

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,340
service so you have to remember to do

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:35,820
that we do have some SNMP it is a

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,610
stripped-down version of SNMP called be

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:44,520
SNMP and there's information about that

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:47,850
in the docs very little and I've had a

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,179
hard time trying to get information on

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,320
the database of mibs that are available

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:58,679
so that's something I like to get more

00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:01,230
information on not sure so they started

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,190
with that because it's very quick and

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,750
easy we have had people in the forums

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,990
talk about various myths that they use

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:14,039
and I've found useful so we're still not

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:16,409
too sure about that but the person who

00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:19,409
wrote the daemon didn't put in the man

00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:21,270
page all of the namib so that's the part

00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:26,039
that we have to work on that's the part

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:28,830
that needs to be documented tftp if you

00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:31,350
have images from your network devices

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:37,770
that you want to set up you can set up

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:41,429
your tftp server and for UPS we do use

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:45,650
nut so any driver that supported by nut

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,650
will show up in your drop-down menu

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:57,270
we have a couple of other buttons here

00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:59,310
so it was underneath our services so if

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,890
you want a quick top on what's happening

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,740
on the system it's read-only so you

00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:06,090
can't go in and issue kill commands you

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,340
want to use shelf you want to do that

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:13,710
but it is a quick way to see what's

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:16,140
happening on the system we do have shell

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,690
which is my favorite place to be and it

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,230
is a full-fledged shell you can do

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:28,290
anything that comes with pre bsd you can

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:30,750
do from the shell prompt you can reboot

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:33,030
the system it's going to turn your

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,280
screen red because it does affect users

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:40,260
if you reboot and the same was shot down

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,600
a couple of less things we have here we

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,910
do have helped and it has hyperlinks to

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,660
all of the help so all the documentation

00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:51,030
the IRC the forums the mailing lists and

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,240
a bug tracker so they're all there is a

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:57,060
hyperlink and if you want to log out

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:02,040
there we have a logout button so it's

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:03,600
basically the layout of the system so

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,840
let's take a look at our configuration

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:11,790
workflow so there's all the cool stuff I

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:14,100
can do now what do I do so if you're

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:19,020
following along in your PDF it starts on

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:20,730
page 27 so once you've gone into your

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,860
system you've set your account your

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,500
email address you got your console login

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,270
going you're ready to go first thing you

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,150
want to deal with is basically your

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,950
storage you want to tell freenas these

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,070
are the discs I want you to use and this

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,440
is what I want you to do with them we do

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,530
this under storage volumes because

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,810
you're basically creating volumes we've

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,600
gone back and forth and how to name the

00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,370
various screens because there's it it's

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,520
hard to get a name that's consistent

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,440
between ufs and ZFS so be nice to call

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,200
it pools and stuff like that but it

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,510
wouldn't work for ufs so we call it

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,980
volumes it's a little bit confusing

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,250
but i'll show you how to go through

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,460
these you basically have three choices

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,180
when you're setting up your storage you

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,040
can do something called auto import and

00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,020
auto importe a lot of people are

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,380
disappointed when they do this nothing

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,080
shows up if nothing shows up it means

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,560
that freenas does not recognize that you

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,740
have existing software raid setup on

00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,800
your system so auto important means you

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,820
already have a ufs mirror stripe orgy

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:36,150
raid 3 or you already have an existing

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:38,010
ZFS strike mirror raid z1 raid z2 that's

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,670
the only thing that it will understand

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,650
so if you have those you obviously want

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,890
to keep your data so you want to auto

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:53,370
import it in so this only works for

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:57,930
existing ufs ZFS software rate the other

00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:01,140
thing that you can do remember cancel

00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:04,590
next time you can do an import and an

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,590
import means I have a disk so it's not

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:10,410
in rate it's just a single disc and it

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,930
already has data and it's been formatted

00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,870
with one of the four following supported

00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:18,450
file systems so that's what I can do

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,600
with that import so if you're a home

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,820
user and you already have a an NTFS

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,310
drive full of stuff that you want to

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:31,140
make available through freenas you go in

00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:33,540
and you import that disk if you're

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,200
starting from scratch what you really

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,690
want to do is to format your volumes so

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,850
the only time you pick volume manager is

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,220
if you're thinking erased what's on the

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:48,000
disk let's start with something new so

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,310
I'm not importing in existing data and

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,750
how come I'm oh yes your system only had

00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,420
two i was looking at mine thinking

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:57,300
where's word my 10 gig 10 gig drives go

00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,480
so what you see in here depends upon

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:03,780
what you select so it will show you all

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,140
of the disks that it recognizes so i can

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,090
go in and select the disks since i only

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,850
have

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:14,590
two discs basically I can only create a

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:17,289
mirror or a stripe if I had three discs

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:21,830
depending upon what file system i picked

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:27,470
with ufs if I had three discs I could

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:29,779
also do a raid 3 and with ZFS if I had

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:33,620
three or more disks I would see things

00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:36,409
like raid z1 raid z2 so the options you

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:39,590
see down here depend upon how many discs

00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:41,779
that you have before you create your

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,860
volumes especially if you're doing it

00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:51,470
for the first time it's really useful to

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:53,690
go through that ZFS requirements thing

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,210
that we went through at the beginning if

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,580
you're using ZFS because you're going to

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:01,429
want to pick the optimum number of disks

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,970
and their sizes and the raid see that is

00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:06,919
good for you if you're just playing you

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:11,330
can just go in and pick anything so I'm

00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:15,260
just going to call this volume one will

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,809
go for ZFS because I'm playing I'll just

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,870
do a stripe because it's fast I'll give

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:22,909
me the best space typically real world

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:28,220
my initial volume wouldn't be a stripe

00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:30,529
because there's no redundancy yeah I

00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,200
won't be able and extend the other thing

00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:36,740
that will be an issue for the next year

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:42,230
or so especially if you're using ZFS so

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:45,770
the newer drives default to this sector

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:48,830
size but older drives didn't always do

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:52,039
that so if you're setting up a ZFS and

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:55,220
your drives are older new year old you

00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:56,480
probably want to check this otherwise

00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:01,399
you're going to have to check to see

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,559
what the default sector size is when you

00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,690
add a volume you'll notice in red is

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,760
reminding you we're not importing

00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,200
existing data if there's anything on

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,320
this disc is going to be destroyed

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,500
because we're formatting with the file

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,460
system that you specified so I'm going

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,460
to create a volume

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:31,450
when you're creating volumes ZFS is

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,640
usually fairly quick ufs depending upon

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,160
the size of the discs may take some time

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,740
because it's formatting the disks so if

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,010
you have very large disk just wait until

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,380
your screen comes back once it's

00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,510
finished doing its formatting you'll

00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,690
notice that you get a new entry under

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:51,460
volumes and this is the name of the

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,470
volume and a volume name will always

00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:00,880
start with m NT because i've created a

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:03,640
ZFS volume i get some extra stuff thrown

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,530
in under that i can go in and create

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:11,140
data sets and i can create z balls so if

00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:15,010
I'm setting up my storage pool so I fed

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:17,290
it a lot of disks if I have many many

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:22,300
disks to choose from I've decided upon

00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:25,930
my best group size and I've made my raid

00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,940
Z for that group size five dis lust over

00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:30,250
I'm going to make another one and stripe

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,990
it and I'll just add it all to the pool

00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:38,830
I then want to decide if i have this big

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:42,160
storage pool do I want to start dividing

00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:44,770
it into areas either to give users their

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,900
own storage space or maybe I need

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,780
certain areas that need to be compressed

00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,690
or I'm thinking of doing deduplication

00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,480
on certain areas that's where you can go

00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:59,770
in and create a data set so I'm going to

00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:02,620
create a data set again anything you

00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:05,140
make in ZFS as soon as you create it it

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,450
takes up no space it's only when you

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,620
start using it that it starts to use

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,720
space as you start to write data to it

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,540
when you're creating a data set if you

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,890
don't set a quota or a reserved space

00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:23,950
the entire pool of space is available to

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,740
that data set if you want to limit it to

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,370
a certain size you go in and set a quota

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,370
for it

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,430
regardless of which way you go the only

00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:42,920
space that gets used is the space that's

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:46,670
written to yes I know what deduplication

00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:50,930
it does yes and one of the things that's

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:54,230
going to be irritating at least until 10

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:58,760
comes out and a freebsd so the way that

00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:00,860
ZFS works on freebsd now it's not very

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,440
good at telling you what space is

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,890
available and usually what it tells you

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,530
is lying so we get a lot of complaints

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:17,480
from trina as users saying it's saying i

00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:21,890
have more space than i have dis sides no

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:25,460
ill I so and the thing that's going to

00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:28,010
fix that is called ZFS d which has not

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,400
been committed to freebsd yet and won't

00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:33,380
be until 10 now what de freenas people

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,570
are thinking of doing because it's

00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,970
really a big deal knowing how much space

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,430
you really do have is as soon as they

00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:43,180
put it in 10 they'll try to mfc it back

00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:46,190
to whatever version were on right now

00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:49,360
because until we have CFS d you're not

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,360
going to get accurate numbers

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,130
yeah so it's a ZFS stamen and it's

00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:59,919
designed to accurately monitor this

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,649
space the other thing that will find

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,890
will be an irritation until the fsd is

00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:10,869
in is hot swapping will not work well

00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:12,609
because it doesn't always notify ZFS ZFS

00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,710
doesn't always notify the kernel that

00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:16,780
hey I'm removing a disk and I'm adding

00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,429
it to the pool so that's something that

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,250
you have to be careful of as well if

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,290
you're in a hot swap environment one CF

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:27,129
SD is out how that will solve both

00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:29,530
problems now I haven't up to this point

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:33,129
mentioned true Nez which is the

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:35,889
commercial version of FreeNAS and it is

00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:38,470
FreeNAS and typically what you're buying

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,679
is the hardware to run it on and the

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:44,649
support that goes with it the newest

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:49,050
version a true Nez it just came out is

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:52,540
based on FreeBSD nine and they put see a

00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:55,720
prototype version of ZFS d into it and

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:59,320
then once that gets tested well I'm sure

00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,420
it'll find its way into freenas but that

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,510
was something that was a really big deal

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:09,520
to corporate customers yes we need to be

00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:11,410
able to hotswap our drives okay so we

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,900
knew we have a volume so you can can

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:17,290
create a data set if you're planning on

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,000
doing I scuzzy you have two choices you

00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,520
can create something called a file

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,480
extent or create something called a

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,089
device extent a file extent is handy

00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,570
because it basically allows you to set

00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:35,290
up the size of the area so I can create

00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:37,750
a file extent this 40 gigs tell I scuzzy

00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:41,800
about that and it will export 40 gigs

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:44,290
worth of space so that means this is the

00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,160
only thing I can do on aufs system is

00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:51,280
create a file extent ZFS the better

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,790
thing to do is to create a device extent

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,660
because they are faster and it emulates

00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:01,359
a raw disk and ZFS supports that so

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,900
that's known as a Z ball so when you're

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,289
creating CFS following

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,510
and again this is where nauman clay chur

00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:10,910
gets a little icky you may think well I

00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,960
just made a volume why am I making a ZFS

00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:16,910
volumes well here you made your pool

00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:22,400
here you really create a device extent

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:25,849
to use with I scuzzy no no I cancelled

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,859
it and when you create your device

00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:30,559
extent you say how big you want it to be

00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:33,589
and it emulates a raw disk of that size

00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:37,849
and they're much faster than file

00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:48,010
extensions EFS make see balls are using

00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:48,010
I scuzzy yep right

00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:57,090
yeah so one of the things I can show you

00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,190
here so we already have a volume no

00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,360
that's wrong place i go back into volume

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,870
manager it's not going to be that

00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,460
exciting because we only had two discs

00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:08,130
but we can do something called extend a

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,460
volume if i give it an existing volume

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:14,400
name and if i had more disks to choose i

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,080
could extend that and it would add that

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,450
disk to whatever my current

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,640
configuration is now there are some

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:23,400
limitations depending upon what your

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,100
current configuration is so if you are

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,960
using a stripe no limitations add

00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,110
whatever does she need and if you lose

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,940
your data you lose your data if you're

00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,800
doing a mirror you should add the same

00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,470
number of disks in your existing mirror

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,680
if you're doing one of the raids ease

00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,990
you've already in your mind decided what

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,350
your group size will be so add the same

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,910
number of disks as your group size but

00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:51,180
that's how you go ahead and add more

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:54,780
storage capacity the other thing that

00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,460
you can do which is it is convenient but

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,020
it really depends upon your hardware and

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,260
whether you can physically add more

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,690
disks if you decide I don't have room to

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,870
add more disks but I want to bump up to

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:10,260
bigger disks what you can do is one at a

00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:13,260
time swap out this wait for it to Reese

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:16,010
/ swap out the next disc so at your

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,330
other alternative for more disk space

00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:21,690
but if you have the room it's really

00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:25,680
nice to be able to extend I'll just make

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:28,710
a note pray I answer that question in 82

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,650
we added this volume to extend because a

00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:35,850
lot of people were getting lost in the

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,160
804 we didn't have this we just told you

00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,470
put in the same volume name and people

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,480
were panicking because it said existing

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,300
data will be cleared yes and I would

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,490
panic at that myself and actually i see

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,590
they still have it here even if i'm

00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:52,380
extending stop to make a note about that

00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:57,350
so if you're extending it doesn't exist

00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,350
data increases capacity yep

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,890
ZFS is happiest and performs best when

00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,559
they're the same size but it will let

00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,960
you put in different sizes now depending

00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,630
upon your configuration if it's any type

00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,019
of rage you may be limited to your

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:25,999
smallest size disk so that's always a

00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:28,759
consideration with raid correct yep it

00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:32,420
will perform optimally when all dis

00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:33,950
sorta same size but it'll still it will

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:41,359
still continue to perk along while

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:44,210
you're getting there okay any questions

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,819
before we leave step one so basically

00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,829
you're telling freenas what devices are

00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:51,200
available to it you're either importing

00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:53,749
in existing software raid you're

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,440
importing in a discarded containing data

00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:58,940
or you're creating your volumes so

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,249
that's the first thing that we do in our

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:12,499
configuration workflow and those were

00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:16,249
pages 27 to 30 in the PDF once you have

00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:17,239
some volumes the next thing is you're

00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:19,430
going to want to start thinking

00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:22,670
permissions so who's going to be having

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:24,499
access to these volumes and you have

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,619
three choices when it comes to

00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:30,140
permissions you can either if you have

00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:33,200
an existing Active Directory domain

00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,869
import all that information in if you

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,450
have an existing ldap domain import all

00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:41,420
that information in and if you have

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:44,660
neither you can start manually creating

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:48,980
users and groups the other thing that

00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:51,920
you need to decide is and it's going to

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:56,390
really depend upon how your network is

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,690
set up is things like a is anonymous

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,749
access okay from my network or do I

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:06,319
really want to limit what users can do

00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:08,539
what they have access to if an anonymous

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,890
access is good enough for your network

00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:12,860
you probably don't even

00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:17,480
have to create a user so for example if

00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:21,320
you're going real easy and just want ftp

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,720
access to data for the people at home we

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,260
already have a built-in ftp user account

00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,710
use that set up anonymous ftp and you're

00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:34,040
good to go now if you're in a more

00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,660
complex environment where users have to

00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,920
have all their own home directories

00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,440
people aren't allowed to see other

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,810
people's data then you start really

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,660
deciding how do I lay out my permissions

00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:47,540
how do I get those users it so it's

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,910
going to be really specific to what it

00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,560
is that you're trying to do so it's

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,940
where a lot of users say well how come

00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,400
there's just not a really quick how-to

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,200
on how to set this up there's just so

00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,660
many different ways you can set things

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,870
up so what we try to do in the

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,600
documentation for each type of service

00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,690
to give examples so in a windows

00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,460
environment how do I allow access

00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:13,610
without users have me input a password

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:16,100
or how do I allow access where everybody

00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,650
has to authenticate and it grabs the

00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,990
information off my active directory so

00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,890
it's really going to be specific to the

00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:26,590
needs of your network what you do so

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:30,370
basically those are your three choices

00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:41,600
Active Directory LDAP or make your own

00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:44,240
if you are making your own yep I know it

00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,630
supports domain credentials I haven't

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,290
seen a how to for single sign-on so I

00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:53,660
don't know and if anybody plays with it

00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:56,360
and it actually works putting a how-to

00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,550
on the forums would be really awesome or

00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,500
making a wiki account when adding it to

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,370
the documentation would be awesome as

00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:07,910
well because there's just so many

00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:10,070
scenarios it's always useful for a

00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,750
specific scenario for somebody right

00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,020
this is the steps that I did to get

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,020
there

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:21,670
if you do end up making users will just

00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:25,930
take a quick look at that user screen

00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,600
again so it's really helpful if you're

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:33,670
familiar with the UNIX way of making

00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:36,640
users windows admin's sometimes don't

00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:39,460
find it to be quite what they're used to

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,580
so basically it's going to give you a

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,670
user ID it's going to automatically bump

00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:50,020
it up for you one of the things you can

00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:52,840
do is if you already have existing data

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,690
with existing user IDs is you can change

00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,060
that to match what your needs are you're

00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,830
going to give username we already talked

00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,130
about the primary group thing you

00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,630
shouldn't really be playing with that

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,680
this is the part that people forget to

00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:11,470
do though by default the home directory

00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,490
does not exist which means there is no

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:17,650
storage available to that user so what

00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:20,620
you need to do if you're making your

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,560
users manually is you want to decide

00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,450
what are they going to have access to so

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,960
are they going to have access to the

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:32,160
full volume the full storage pool if so

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,840
I should be writing I should be picking

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,600
mount volume 1 because this is the

00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,570
volume I've created in this network if

00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,670
I've gone and created data sets I want

00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,130
to decide well what am I doing with

00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,490
these data sets am i given each user

00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:51,970
their own data set to play with am I

00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:54,190
giving groups data set how am I actually

00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:57,280
dividing out my data so it's going to be

00:44:54,190 --> 00:45:00,250
very specific for you so if you decide

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,990
to do the data set thing you're going to

00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:04,600
want to create your data sets first

00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:08,260
before you create your users and then

00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,810
assign users to data sets so as long as

00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,510
their home directory shows it's

00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:15,880
non-existent that user isn't getting at

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,770
the storage data and that's probably the

00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,080
number one thing that people get lost

00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:22,670
out my users can't get it anything and

00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,770
that's why

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:29,670
the home directory mode is going to be

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:32,700
specific to this user and you can decide

00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:35,850
whether groups or others have access to

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,730
their home directory the only time you

00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,560
have to set a shell as if users or SSH

00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,100
again and they care they know what a

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,450
shell is I don't what they want you're

00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:50,990
going to set things like the full name

00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:54,390
email passwords and you can disable

00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:56,100
password logins and it really depends

00:45:54,390 --> 00:46:01,200
upon what type of share that you're

00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:03,000
using so if you are creating SSS ss8

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,430
shares and you don't want the user

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,640
coming in through ssh you should disable

00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:10,640
password logins yes

00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:26,160
yes yes and there was a couple of things

00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:28,290
before we had shell it men had to

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,740
actually go into ssh into set

00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:34,460
permissions so for example for an ssh

00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,500
chroot those have to be done manually

00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,260
just because of the way it works now

00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:45,660
that we have web shell is so much easier

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:48,030
to go in and again dealing with data

00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:51,600
sets you may decide to do things on

00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:53,880
group basis so you may make groups that

00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,740
get associated with certain data sets if

00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,770
that's the case you'll want to make sure

00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:03,080
that the user is a member of the group

00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,080
that you want them to have access to

00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:10,950
creating groups there's really not much

00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:14,190
to it it's going to suggest an ID for

00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:17,340
you which you can change your going to

00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:19,970
give the group a name and you can check

00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:23,609
this box if you already have existing

00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:29,700
group permissions say in Active

00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:32,280
Directory sorry and you want to let that

00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,109
group also share that ID to match up the

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,650
group so this is something that you can

00:47:34,109 --> 00:47:36,650
add as well

00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:50,329
once you somehow have your where am I

00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:53,869
here and I want to view volumes once you

00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:57,049
have either imported your users or

00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:59,450
you've created your users the

00:47:57,049 --> 00:48:02,240
permissions actually get set on the

00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:06,609
volume itself yeah where's our

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,609
permissions there it is

00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:17,220
and this is often confusing to users as

00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:19,620
well so if you're manually creating your

00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,080
users you should already know ahead of

00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,450
time are they going to live in a volume

00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,420
or a data set and make sure that's their

00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:29,640
home directory you're also then going to

00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,480
want to go to your volumes and data sets

00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:37,530
and set the starting permissions and the

00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:41,130
starting ownership on that so in a

00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:44,070
volume when it says owner and user this

00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,890
is basically the person who has the

00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:51,090
ability to change permissions on that

00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:53,760
portion of storage so you can either

00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:57,170
leave it at root or wheel or you can

00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,210
specify it to a specific user or group

00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:03,750
the mode is going to be the UNIX style

00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:05,790
which gets ignored if you change it to

00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:09,780
windows because that's going to add your

00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:12,840
windows equal ability to it when you're

00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,750
deciding what mode to use it's always

00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,700
safe to use unix because every client

00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,100
operating system out there understands

00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:24,240
unique style permissions so your basic

00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:27,030
read write execute if you are in an

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,480
Active Directory domain you're not going

00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:32,160
to get the full extended attributes

00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:35,340
provided within that domain if you don't

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,440
pick Windows but that means that all of

00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,800
the clients in the network have to be

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,750
able to understand windows ACLs so it

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,010
really depends upon how your network is

00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:49,290
set up what you have to be careful of is

00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:53,160
your mode and this set permission

00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:57,720
recursively thing so this mode doesn't

00:49:53,160 --> 00:50:01,140
mean that only route and wheel has these

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:04,350
set of permissions so this is the user

00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:07,620
and owner that basically has the ability

00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:10,890
to change permissions and these are the

00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:13,440
starting permissions on the share once

00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:16,890
this share has been created and people

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,710
start creating data from the client they

00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,690
can fine-tune the permissions so these

00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,490
are the starting permissions but then

00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,800
once the client gets there they

00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,600
do what they want so users can put

00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,330
tighter permissions on their own files

00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,220
and directories you want to give them

00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:35,610
enough permissions that they can get in

00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:39,380
through the share in the first place be

00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:42,330
very cautious about checking this box

00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:46,430
especially if there's existing data on

00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:50,310
the volume or data set the way that

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:52,800
FreeNAS sets permissions recursively it

00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,650
sort of has to loop through the UNIX

00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,380
ones then the windows ones and then it

00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:02,190
does a check it takes a fair bit of time

00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:04,650
and its CPU intensive so it can actually

00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:08,190
bog down the freeness system if it's

00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:11,820
busy so what we recommend is if you need

00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,100
to change permissions recursively do on

00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,080
the client that way all the work is

00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,640
happening at the client end it's not

00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,750
going to affect users of the freenas

00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:24,450
system we've got two minutes have I lost

00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:26,430
anybody here is it usually its

00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,290
permissions that people get stuck on

00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:34,500
they'll say made my share and nobody can

00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:38,250
access at what's happening okay so you

00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:44,300
have volumes you somehow got users into

00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:51,750
the system you've set permissions and

00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:53,460
then we get into sharing and I'll see

00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,700
what I can say about sharing in a minute

00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,220
and a half you basically have three

00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,680
choices when it comes to sharing and if

00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:04,260
you read the documentation out so we

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,740
have a whole chapter on sharing it says

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:10,170
pick one type of sharing and what you

00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,180
pick is going to depend upon the types

00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:18,330
of clients running in your network and

00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:20,340
also your needs for speed when it comes

00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:22,500
to network performance because different

00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:25,200
types of shares have different

00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,390
performance the reason why we tell

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,810
people to pick one type of share and

00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:33,180
this is per storage volume or data set

00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:35,250
so this is another reason why people

00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,559
make data sets maybe they want their

00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,469
windows users to

00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,410
this data their mac users to get at that

00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:44,989
data and we can do that using data sets

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,749
and sharing data sets with different

00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:50,539
shares but for the same volume or data

00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:53,420
set don't set up multiple types of

00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:56,839
shares and a classic example of that

00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:59,329
deals with file locking if I have one

00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:02,469
user coming in through windows and a

00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:05,959
UNIX user happens to open the same file

00:53:02,469 --> 00:53:08,119
NFS will lock that file but the windows

00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:10,459
user won't know that because it's coming

00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:14,809
in through sips so you'll actually end

00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:16,249
up with two people changing a file at

00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:19,630
the same time what's going to happen to

00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:22,910
that file so Anna locking is one reason

00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:26,150
another reason if you have a mix of say

00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:29,809
windows and mac users and windows users

00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:32,420
look at the files in there directory

00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:33,920
there's all these weird names they say

00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,380
long and get rid of that delete the

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,749
stuff I don't know what it is they may

00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,539
end up deleting all of your Apple fork

00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:44,269
Apple double data so you don't want

00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:46,939
confused users like that so you pick one

00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:49,789
type of sharing and I think that's all

00:53:46,939 --> 00:53:52,189
we'll do before lunch so when we come

00:53:49,789 --> 00:53:55,959
back we'll talk more about sharing which

00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:55,959
type is appropriate for which client

00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,810
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:07,760
ago we could not have imagined that

00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,980
asterisk would not only become the most

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,110
widely adopted open source communication

00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,150
software on the planet but that it would

00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:16,670
impact the entire industry in the way

00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:18,650
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:21,290
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,240
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:25,340
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,750
transition of power from the hands of

00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,000
the traditional proprietary phone

00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:31,400
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,470
administrators of phone systems using

00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,120
this power our customers have traded all

00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:37,220
sorts of business changing applications

00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,020
from small office phone systems to

00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,120
mission-critical call centers the

00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,950
international carrier networks in fact

00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,420
there's even an entire country those

00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,880
communications infrastructure runs on

00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,800
esters the gym has always been about

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,510
creating technology that expands

00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,670
communications capabilities in ways that

00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:54,050
we could never have imagined and that's

00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:56,900
part of what's game-changing about the

00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:59,150
gym today we're doing it again this time

00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,250
by introducing a new family of HD IP

00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,530
phones that extends control of the user

00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,300
all the way to the desktop the launch of

00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,820
these new products represents the next

00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,470
phase indigenous history of innovation

00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:11,420
these are the first and only IP phones

00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:13,010
designed to fully leverage the power of

00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,630
Astra's when we first discussed our

00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,430
expectations for building a family of

00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,590
phones for use with asterisk our

00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:20,330
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,950
the team to build the phones such that

00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:24,170
they were easy to install integrate

00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:26,000
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:28,580
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,200
that goal user feedback is validating

00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,330
that when it comes to operation with

00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,730
astro space systems including our own

00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:37,310
Switchvox based product these are the

00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:38,630
easiest to use best integrated most

00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:41,210
interoperable products on the market

00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:43,210
today the digitally phones will

00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,260
initially include three IP des hommes

00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,210
uniquely designed to complement any

00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,070
asterisks or switch box based solution

00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,740
these phones are different for a number

00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:54,380
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,820
designed for use with esters secondly

00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,430
we've made it really easy to

00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,840
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:01,910
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,860
to access information inside of asterisk

00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:05,470
allowing tight coupling between an

00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,460
application and the

00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,589
additionally we've created an

00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,720
applications engine that allows users

00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:14,329
and developers to create and run their

00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,369
own apps on the following and finally

00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,440
we've done all of this at a very

00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:20,119
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,920
always thinking of ways to give our

00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:24,290
customers the best value in business

00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,150
phone systems and also give them the

00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,310
power to create their own solutions or

00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,109
eating communications challenge will

00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,849
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:33,890
to make Astra's cooler faster and more

00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:35,540
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,030
asterisk and what communications even

00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:41,740
easier and together we'll change the way

00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,740
the world communicates again

00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:58,970
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:01,130
way to better utilize all your resources

00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:04,579
and it makes managing all your resources

00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:08,410
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:11,930
happening in open source the

00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:13,730
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:15,650
of the community and the speed at which

00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,809
these are these you know these

00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:20,119
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:22,730
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:25,460
that really shows the power of the you

00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:27,079
know of the open source community it is

00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:31,280
global and it's definitely because of

00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:37,609
the users community people are extremely

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:39,349
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:40,780
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:42,920
these guys helping each other out and

00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:45,829
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,660
manner the product is transparent for

00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:51,680
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:53,869
base everyone can see how close that is

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:59,750
being built nothing nothing is

00:57:53,869 --> 00:58:02,390
proprietary everything is open in many

00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:06,589
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:10,369
ongoing health cloudstack the most

00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:14,210
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:16,910
was our first developer boot camp

00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:19,550
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:23,510
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:27,680
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:30,530
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,050
chairs into the room twice everything

00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:36,320
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:39,380
is open source and so I don't think that

00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,119
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:44,180
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,880
computing and so i think it's i think

00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:48,230
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,970
about cloud computing you're really

00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,970
talking about a source cloud computing

00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,280
cloud zac is a robust solution for large

00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,680
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,700
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:07,970
data centers these hardware is going to

00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:11,180
fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:13,670
handle number one that mass scale number

00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:16,400
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:18,650
that inevitably happens in large

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,470
deployments we started working on

00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:24,980
college attack over four years ago and

00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:27,589
it was the original set of people

00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,780
working on it had a background of

00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:33,589
delivering software telcos and service

00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:38,060
providers lots of QA lots of users

00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:42,040
actually using it high availability is a

00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:44,990
key feature multiple hypervisors support

00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:47,420
different network models you can pick up

00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:49,550
whatever suits you better while steck

00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:53,060
management server can be deployed in

00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:54,859
different physical machines it

00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,510
definitely has a huge footprint it's

00:59:54,859 --> 01:00:01,910
being deployed everywhere there's a

00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:03,640
major movie studio that they were using

01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:06,830
cloudstack they were using it to

01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,020
transcode video and I thought that was

01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,339
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,609
fascinating is what they did during

01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:16,369
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:17,750
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:18,360
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,450
the instance

01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:23,850
isn't it back to doing real work

01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,380
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:27,240
different aspects and there's no one

01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:30,470
person that's kind of like a master of

01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,690
all those realms I think CloudStack as a

01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:36,030
project is going to be one of the

01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:39,990
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:45,420
most feature fallen and and robust

01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:48,350
platforms help Taylor Adams senior
