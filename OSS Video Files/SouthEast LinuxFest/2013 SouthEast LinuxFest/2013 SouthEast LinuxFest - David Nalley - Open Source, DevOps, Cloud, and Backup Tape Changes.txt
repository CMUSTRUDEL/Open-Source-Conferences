the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,150
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,449
possible so i'm a member of the apache

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,750
software foundation and I spend most of

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,450
my time working on Apache CloudStack but

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,770
that's really kind of a different role

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,829
that I've stepped into in the past

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,530
couple of years I have historically been

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,140
an operation sky and I describe myself

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,500
as a recovering sysadmin which means

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,660
that I I still remember that it's down

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,570
and not across before I before I started

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,629
working pretty actively on CloudStack I

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,719
was a contributor to the Fedora project

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,820
and I still do some work there but I

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,549
used to be a spend a lot more time

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,520
working on fedora I also worked on xenos

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,080
which is a monitoring package naturally

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,430
because I was a sysadmin and needed to

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,619
monitor things for about the past year

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,090
or so a year and a half I've been

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,119
employed by Citrix and I work in the

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,100
open source business office which allows

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,700
me to spend a good chunk of my time on

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,600
CloudStack so to set your expectations

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:39,869
this is a wildly opinionated talk it's

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,720
not even so much a talk about about any

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,470
specific technology is not a really deep

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:52,280
talk from a technical perspective it's

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:56,250
really a talk about my path from being a

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,110
bastard operator from Hell to someone

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,759
who is actively working on cloud

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,750
projects so I also make plenty of

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,600
prognostication and

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,300
you'll see some of those we go along so

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,850
a little more background about me so I

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,040
said I was recovering sysadmin what that

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:21,500
really means is that I used to be a

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:24,950
server hugger I used to be one of the

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,280
organizers for self in the the first

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,140
three years and I I used to have a rule

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,420
for talks that if your talk mentioned

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:39,050
cloud it would never appear as a

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:42,230
presentation itself I used to think that

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,940
cloud computing was a disaster waiting

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,420
to happen that you know essentially it

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:52,000
was trying to bypass IT and then I had a

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,410
study sudden cloudy conversion akin to a

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,040
religious experience Damascus Road

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,840
experience and found myself going from

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,980
server hugger to someone who had a cloud

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,600
com email address in a period of six

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,430
months or so so let's uh let's talk

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,670
about the status quo in operations today

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,590
right so here's a story someone starts a

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,989
new project that has something to do

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,799
with IT so they start asking for

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,320
resources and so they file a ticket

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,010
right because hopefully you're it's not

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,850
go visit go visit Joe and say hey I need

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,640
I need a server I need an app server

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,230
that I can run software on hopefully

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,170
they you actually have a ticket

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:43,310
ticketing system to make those requests

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:46,010
and then you have to wait so then

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,780
depending upon your organization and and

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,090
where you are in that organization you

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,709
may get resources and a lot of times

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,190
those resources aren't configured so

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,769
maybe they ordered you real hardware and

00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,019
the hardware arrives but it's not racked

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:01,940
it's not cabled it certainly doesn't

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,690
have an operating system installed so

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,190
you have to wait on that then there's an

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,079
entirely different group that manages

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,060
network access sometimes there's two or

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,849
three different network groups that you

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,250
have to deal with so while you've got

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,810
this power or we've got power running to

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,700
the server you've got

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,770
you've got the network cables all

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,419
plugged in but they don't actually have

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,139
network connectivity so then you have to

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,639
ask for network access which requires

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,040
getting permission telling them exactly

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,870
what you want to do and then waiting my

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,720
my favorite example of this is actually

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:44,340
one from the company that I work for so

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,130
I went a few weeks back and installed

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,710
about 10 machines in Iraq in a data

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,919
center that was going to be a lab

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,990
environment for our group and we've been

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,210
working on this since februari so

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,440
februari this year we said hey we're

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,389
going to have some equipment we need a

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,510
place they found us a place they got us

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,600
power they got us a brand new rack got

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,830
all the PD use in the rack and when we

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,130
were there we could just slide the

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,050
machines in and go I still don't have

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:18,300
network access to any of the machines in

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:20,639
that rack it is now June and so from

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,729
februari to June we're not able to get

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,490
permission and still working on getting

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,380
permission and getting people to to

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,800
allow us to connect all those machines

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,270
to the network and then finally after

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,200
you've gone through all of this hassle

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:41,130
you can get things done that that is the

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:45,780
status quo in ops today and anyone have

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,710
a situation better than this tell me

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,710
about your situation then

00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:01,710
a boner say the SMP server they put in a

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,560
ticket they come to us we checked

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,420
resources then we build the machine for

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,660
them and headed off to them because

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,950
sounds like where you're going basically

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:18,090
you hand out on our blank slate is all

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:21,930
the OS figure but that is then we have

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:25,350
to support it and now you can have every

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:29,690
a poner individually does their own you

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,690
know that they still catch their own way

00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:41,640
the base OS is so so from the time an

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,140
appt owner request resources to the time

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:58,230
they get them what's your timeline for

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:59,880
doing that that's pretty good so i get

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:04,280
for better or worse i get to talk to a

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:07,890
lot of organizations and i talked to a

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:13,530
the director of ops at a digital media

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:15,540
company a few months back they had

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,090
completely moved to virtualization two

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,670
years two years before we had the

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,890
conversation so everything was a virtual

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,980
machine you would think that that

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:30,060
simplifies things right so much less to

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:32,280
rack and cable it's easier to hand

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,820
things out it's also easier to allow

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,940
other people to do things their timeline

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,650
to get a machine a resource when it was

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,260
requested out to someone with still

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:49,890
eight weeks I've had conversations with

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,640
other organizations who do incredible

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:56,970
research right they have they have a

00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:01,020
super computing facility and it takes

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:03,410
them 12 weeks eight weeks to get a

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,410
resource

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:11,330
think about think about the kind of

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:15,889
delay that that introduced so this

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:20,600
status quo is that we focus on control

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:22,820
and permission and we don't actually

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,940
focus on allowing people to get things

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:31,120
done I think this quan honestly is

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:33,770
disastrous for IT in general we've also

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,099
we've also become far more central to

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:42,380
the business so there are very few

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:45,020
things that that are that businesses do

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,410
today that do not interact with IT in

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,589
some fashion or another so one of my

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,960
previous employers was a manufacturing

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:58,610
company they manufactured kayaks and

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,370
they essentially could not manufacture a

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,430
single kayak without the IT systems in

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,260
place even though you know it's

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:11,060
essentially a boat actually getting it

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,820
manufactured from whether it's

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,940
controlling the the molding and

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,030
injection machines to actually printing

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,690
the Coast Guard registration documents

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:26,930
to recording in the MRP system that that

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,420
boat exists essentially if one or more

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,589
of those systems went down an entire

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,410
manufacturing line and that is as free

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:39,440
from technology as I know of a business

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:43,100
to be but it still was core to actually

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:47,780
getting things done and the problem is

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,240
is that we've gone from I think being

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,970
slightly disaffected and ignored by the

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,410
business as something that adds a little

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,990
bit of value to be in core to the

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,110
business and we built a fiefdom around

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:04,250
operations so that we essentially tell

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:07,130
everyone that they must come and and bow

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:12,170
before us and to get whatever we want

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:15,740
and we act as if as if it is ours to

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,290
dispense the problem that that creates

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,649
is that the constraint is worse

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,839
never so if you want to get things done

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,779
it is far harder to get things done now

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,380
than it was a few years ago generally

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:33,350
speaking people actually hate

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,870
interacting with operations now if you

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,209
work in an IT shop a traditional IT shop

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,350
chances are your coworkers despise

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:46,190
having to come and ask you for resources

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,829
and we also and this is I think plays

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,220
back to our geek culture we have a

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:55,459
maniacal focus on technology we care

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,199
about the bright shiny tools and we lose

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:01,269
sight of the fact that we are there to

00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,269
actually deliver value for the business

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,230
but some other things have been going on

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:13,009
as well right so much of the the

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:17,899
processes that we provide and that we

00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:20,930
step through have become a commodity you

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:25,310
know whether it's whether it's having a

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:28,130
CRM system that's a commodity now

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,750
effectively who cares about the the

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,190
differences between individual CRM

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,370
systems if I need something and I need

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,130
it fast I can go to salesforce com and I

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,829
can consume it I can go to Sugar CRM and

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,720
consume it and I no longer need to

00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:47,600
interact with IT at same thing with same

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,589
thing with access to machines I can plop

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,639
down a credit card and get access to AWS

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:58,790
so this has led to a lot of people

00:11:52,639 --> 00:12:03,439
bypassing IT and and effectively shadow

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:07,000
IT coming into existence so I had a

00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:11,470
chance to have dinner recently with the

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,350
CTO of the largest retailer in the world

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:17,660
and we were sitting down and talking and

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,910
he was essentially expressing their

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,069
vision for IT for the next few years and

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,160
people said hey we heard about this

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:27,319
particular initiative coming out of of

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,500
your company and he said that is not a

00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:40,450
central IT initiative it was a gigantic

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:43,870
nine figure deal for for IT services and

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:47,360
it wasn't didn't involve IT at all

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:50,420
essentially a department having said you

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,160
know we can no longer operate under the

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,380
constraints of IT we will go spend our

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,500
money on our own without allocating it

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,680
to centralized IT and essentially they

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,390
were working their way around working

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,130
their way around aighty to get things

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:09,560
done when you have a company with that

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,810
is publicly traded that has all the

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,519
compliance issues that publicly traded

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:20,089
companies have that is large massively

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:24,740
large on a global scale and they have to

00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:30,529
bypass a centralized IT you know there's

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:32,690
something wrong right so I I also about

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,990
about a year ago I had a conversation

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,589
with a really large software vendor they

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:43,880
sell about 50 billion dollars worth of

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:47,180
software a year and their discovery was

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,699
that that their requests for service for

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,040
their operations folks where it was at

00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,690
an all-time low and they thought man we

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,630
must be doing a really good job because

00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,579
the Q's low people aren't requesting

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,620
things and they started looking into

00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,880
this because I said you know we're doing

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,230
things we ought to make a case study out

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,290
of how we're doing things so well and

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,510
tell our customers to go do this and so

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,240
they started looking around and one of

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,570
the things that they discovered was that

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:18,320
individual development managers were

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:21,440
we're expensing AWS environments so

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,800
there would be 30 or 40 different AWS

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,089
environments for any given project and

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,149
the developers were doing all of their

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,829
work in AWS because centralized IT was

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,029
taking so long to respond that it was

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:36,500
killing all of their project timelines

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,140
one of the things that I found as we as

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,709
we as I continued to talk to people is

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,300
that if you do not work in a skiff and

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,339
if you don't know what a skiff is you

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,999
don't work in one

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:52,100
that you have people that are using

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:54,800
Amazon to get their work done or some

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,499
other public cloud provider that has

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,959
become a ubiquitous problem across all

00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:02,350
enterprises and for the places that have

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:06,259
to deal with compliance it's a nightmare

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,809
so essentially shadow IT has come in and

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:12,350
said you know traditional IT traditional

00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:15,649
operations is not satisfying me I can

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:20,029
plop down a credit card and I can do get

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:22,069
my needs met far more easily and people

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:26,509
are doing that and that is the status

00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:29,089
quo today a lot of times the shadow IT

00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:32,209
organization is actually larger a number

00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:36,980
of nodes then the traditional operations

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:40,040
is at this point so this is the status

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,329
quo and we're going to take a couple of

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:50,720
detours so I'm going to talk a little

00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:52,670
bit about cloud and so cloud is these

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,079
are the different cloud service models

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,699
and I don't want to bore anyone anyone

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,990
not familiar with infrastructure as a

00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:59,870
service platform as a service and

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:06,499
software as a service okay Joe you can

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:07,970
read while I thought so there are there

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,649
are a number of things and cloud

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,050
computing is really focused on a couple

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:14,589
of things and to quote dave nielsen

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:18,920
cloud is awesome which is on demand

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:22,220
self-service scalable and measurable so

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,350
on demand means that a user can anytime

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,410
they need to consume a resource they can

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,480
get access to it and provision it when

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:33,620
they want to and get that within a

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,139
matter of minutes self-service means

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:39,589
that they don't need to have you

00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:41,209
interact with them so they don't need to

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,910
file a ticket with you to get access to

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,990
those resources not only can they get it

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,319
when they need it they can do it

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,059
themselves so scalable means that it

00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:53,300
gives the appearance that there are

00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:55,790
limitless resources I think this is the

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:59,880
most tenuous element in cloud computing

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:01,590
but essentially for

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,730
most of the applications most of the

00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:07,380
people who will be consuming your

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:10,640
services they do not run into limits at

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,130
the same time virtually every cloud

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,079
environment has limits so if you plug in

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,680
your credit card to amazon they have a

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,120
default limit of five machines so you

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,190
cannot provision more than five machines

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,810
without talking to amazon about it and

00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,910
of course measurable you want to be able

00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,590
to measure what you're consuming so you

00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,360
may get charged based on the resources

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:37,260
you're consuming rather than flat rates

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,620
or are something else but clouds really

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,720
an automation enabler right so cloud

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,220
computing particularly infrastructure as

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,740
a service and platform as a service

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,230
those are really there's really just

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,610
automation tools which makes them

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,060
uninteresting unless you're an

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,150
operations person so it's getting all of

00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,640
those processes out of the way and

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:03,690
automating them in a manner that allows

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,580
people to get things done so if you have

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,260
a process right now that allocates an IP

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,480
address but goes before some network

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,280
review board chances are you're you're

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,720
not adding value by putting it before

00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,150
the review board and you could codify

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,600
all of the policies that you want to

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:27,890
apply so no group can have more than n

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:30,990
number of IP addresses you don't allow

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:35,130
these firewall rules or you don't allow

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,250
a certain number of ports to be exposed

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,350
to the Internet all of those things are

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,480
things that you can apply as policies

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,220
that still allow you to have some

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,740
control but don't require you to have

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:52,200
manual processes and so I would argue

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,730
that the vast majority of manual

00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:01,170
processes even if their approval

00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:04,050
processes do not add value anymore so

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:06,810
cloud computing is a wonderful tool it's

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:10,610
but it's a tool and it's something that

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:13,680
you have to actually consume as a tool

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,510
so let's talk a little bit about DevOps

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:22,350
you can't read this because it's really

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:28,110
small these are the the 14 goals set out

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:31,800
by Edward dimming and dimming is a guy

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:35,040
who wrote who who went over to Japan

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,050
after World War two and essentially set

00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:42,120
up the automotive industry in Japan and

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:44,190
made it so incredibly effective let me

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,630
just read through these for you and

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:51,480
essentially these 14 goals have been

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,630
have been espoused by the the devops

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,670
movement so create constancy of purpose

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,260
towards improvement of product and

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,930
service with the aim to become

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,590
competitive stay in business and to

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:07,080
provide jobs adopt the new philosophy we

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,090
are in a new economic age Western

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,130
management must awaken to the challenge

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,030
must learn their responsibilities and

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,980
take on leadership or change cease

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,490
dependence on inspection to achieve

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,560
quality to achieve quality eliminate the

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,330
need for massive inspection by building

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,810
quality into the product in the first

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:29,910
place improved constantly and forever

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,860
the system of production and service to

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,970
improve quality and productivity and

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:39,540
thus constantly decrease costs Institute

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:42,120
training on the job Institute leadership

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,250
the aim of supervision should be to help

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,950
people and machines and gadgets do a

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,630
better job supervision of management is

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,140
in need of overhaul as well as

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,880
supervision of production workers drive

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,970
out fear so that everyone may work

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,070
effectively for the company break down

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,320
barriers between departments people in

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,170
research design sales and production

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,030
must work as a team in order to foresee

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,590
problems of production and usage that

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,400
may be encountered with the product or

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,980
service eliminate slogans excitations

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,450
and targets for the workforce asking for

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,420
zero defects and new levels of

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,940
productivity such exportations only

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,560
create adversarial relationships as the

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,270
bulk of the causes of low quality and

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,340
low productivity belonged to the system

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,640
and thus lie beyond the power of the

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,600
work

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,700
force eliminate work standards or quotas

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,610
on the factory floor substitute with

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,130
leadership eliminate management by

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,950
objective eliminate management by

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,110
numbers and numerical goals instead

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,090
substitute with leadership remove

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,580
barriers that Rob the hourly worker of

00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,980
his right to pride of workmanship the

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,610
responsibilities of supervisors must be

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,960
changed from sheer numbers to quality

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,570
remove barriers that Rob people in

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,950
management and indeed and in engineering

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,040
of their right to pride of workmanship

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,260
this means inter alia abolishment of the

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,230
annual or merit rating and of management

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,640
by objectives Institute a vigorous

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,430
program of education and

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,590
self-improvement put everybody in the

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,990
company to work to accomplish the

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:19,590
transformation the transformation is

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,490
everybody's job I despise reading from

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:26,190
slides but I think that these 14

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,730
elements are key to a key to a

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,680
transformation in IT the sad fact though

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,240
is that this has been around since the

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,970
40s and we have thought that I T is such

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,100
a different discipline that we didn't

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,820
care to learn from the rest of the

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:51,030
business world and as much of a geek as

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:54,650
I am there's more to IT then then

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:57,330
playing with the cool shiny tools so I

00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,070
would recommend this is this is a little

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,870
heavy reading but out of the crisis by

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:06,270
Edward Deming should be on the reading

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:10,430
list those 14 things that were worthy

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:13,380
right so Damon Edwards and John Willis

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:18,390
kind of crystallized what DevOps means

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:22,260
into culture automation measurement and

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:25,530
sharing so I I think that the key issue

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:29,270
really is culture and just to talk a

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:33,050
little bit about culture I talked about

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:35,700
operations erecting the fiefdom right so

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:39,000
when a developer wants a resource they

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,020
come to operations and ask for the

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,110
resource

00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,990
operation typically hands it off to them

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:47,820
and then never looks back development

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,620
then goes and does their own thing they

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,480
create an application and then they toss

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,450
it over the wall and say hey I'm done

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,840
check it out build it and and go run it

00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:01,560
in production and they they never looked

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,030
back right which means operations has

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,710
this thing that they don't really know

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,390
how to operate that there then

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,630
responsible for getting into production

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,820
and the business then depends upon it

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:15,600
and often development and operations

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:21,660
never come together to work so if you go

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,910
back to if you come back here break down

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,090
barriers between departments I think is

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:30,450
one of the key issues that that we have

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,250
problems with as we've erected these

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:38,610
these fiefdom particularly in operations

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:41,880
and not that operations is completely at

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,440
fault here but we've essentially made it

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,170
more difficult for people to work with

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,740
us and made our jobs more difficult in

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:53,300
the process so when we're talking about

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,740
a DevOps culture weird we're focusing on

00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,860
ensuring that operations is working for

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,030
the good of the business and

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:05,220
interoperating with the other groups in

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:07,260
the business so I get to travel around

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,190
and I get to hang out with John willison

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:14,580
and to a lesser degree Damon Edwards and

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:17,870
so I'm I said John you know this sounds

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,420
a lot like the books my dad used to read

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:24,360
when I was much younger and we started

00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:27,720
talking about the goal this is another

00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,440
book and it really talks about the

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:36,950
theory of constraints this is a novel

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,510
about about a factory that's

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,360
manufacturing company that's having

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,310
problems and about to go under they

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,060
introduce lots of automation they've got

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:51,840
robots and yet the company is still on

00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,490
the verge of going under I absolutely

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
recommend that you add this book to your

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,970
read

00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:02,040
it's much more possible than out of the

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:07,170
crisis and you'll start to see a lot of

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:10,470
a lot of similarities between that

00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:17,550
manufacturing world and and the current

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:19,740
world of IT operations anyway so so this

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,630
has also become kind of one of those

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,240
books that even though it deals with a

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:27,750
field completely different because of

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,400
the theories that it introduces the

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,090
DevOps world has started consuming it

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,970
but you know this is this is something

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:39,510
that isn't easily translatable I would

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,510
argue into the operations world so if

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,380
you want to look at the future of IT I

00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:47,370
think you should buy the Phoenix project

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,920
how many of you have not read the

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,240
Phoenix project how many of you have not

00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,180
heard of the Phoenix project before

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,070
today okay so we'll take a little break

00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,280
right here while you jump on amazon com

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:02,210
this is I'm not kidding this is the most

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:07,050
important book that I can tell you about

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:11,310
reading it will will either scare you or

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:15,090
it will inspire you and it should be the

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:18,390
next book that you read period you will

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:21,060
gain if you work in an operations or the

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,160
development side of the house this

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:29,490
particular book is the most valuable

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:32,430
book you can be reading period I bought

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:36,570
so I know one of the authors whose Jean

00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:39,180
Kim who's he's also wrote a book called

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:42,360
visible ops and he's got a couple of

00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,710
other books in process right now when

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,770
this came out I bought it the day that

00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:49,650
that it came out I literally couldn't

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:52,830
put it down I started reading at 11 I

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:57,660
didn't get any sleep I it took me until

00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:02,970
about 5am to finish the book and I could

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:04,260
not put it down and i would i'd be

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,419
willing to bet that it will be career

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,759
changing for you if you have not

00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:14,190
if you're interested in DevOps if you

00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:16,889
work in operations or development so the

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,179
Phoenix project by jin kim really it

00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:21,389
should be something that you ordered

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:25,529
while i was running my mouth so the

00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:27,470
problem is that creates a beautiful

00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:30,600
picture of where you can go it does

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:35,509
outline some of the difficulties but

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,509
that's the future of IT only if we adapt

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:45,210
so we have this we build all of these

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:49,769
silos these fiefdom we have culture that

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:53,279
is very difficult to change if you John

00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:54,989
alspaugh who who's at Etsy who's one of

00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:01,289
the great I would argue one of the great

00:28:54,989 --> 00:29:04,070
DevOps success stories they if you talk

00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:06,480
to him he says you cannot change culture

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:10,739
that's the most difficult thing while

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,289
culture is the core one of the corson

00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:14,460
elements of DevOps is having the right

00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:16,529
culture and a culture that works

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:21,769
together you cannot directly change

00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:24,989
culture you can change behavior and then

00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,779
once you've changed behavior that can

00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:29,669
slowly become culture but that's a

00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:33,809
process over time and it also requires

00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:37,200
buying the management which is all the

00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:41,070
more difficult the big change though is

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,009
we must stop becoming we must stop being

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:47,609
this island of operations and IT and

00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:50,299
assume that we are special and that

00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:52,499
nobody understands the work that we do

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:54,149
the reason that we are special is

00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,919
because we've enabled the business to

00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:58,169
get things done and to do things more

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,230
efficiently so we must become a partner

00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:03,899
to the business and as much as the geek

00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,210
in me hates business talks I think that

00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:08,369
I think that if we don't do this we

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,539
don't start adapting than becoming a

00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:14,159
partner people will continue to avoid us

00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:16,230
people will work around us will become

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,129
irrelevant I'd argue that in many cases

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,129
we already are

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,659
look at look at your provisioning

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:29,490
process today how many of you have

00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:35,340
Amazon AWS counts how many folks in here

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,720
work in operations so go get yourself an

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,559
amazon account plop down your credit

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,639
card they have a free offering let out

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,580
counts right so Amazon's ax amazon is a

00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:49,470
placeholder for for a cloud provider

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,500
look at how easy it is for someone to

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:56,909
provision a virtual machine and then

00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:00,149
compare that to your process anyone

00:30:56,909 --> 00:31:23,000
remember anyone work in IT when when

00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:23,000
these were around yeah sure but

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:54,750
so so I would argue that go ahead it

00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,250
shouldn't be right but the standard

00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:02,970
business is doing it wrong is what I'm

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:05,690
arguing so so I am the I come from a

00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:08,970
traditional bastard operator from hell

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,150
let me architect something for you so

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,430
that I can I'm responsible for it when

00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,930
something goes wrong otherwise don't

00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:19,200
call me if you're going to go out and do

00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:22,320
your your own thing the problem is is

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,690
that when we do that as operations folks

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,180
we essentially say you know all of your

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,550
concerns are not important my concerns

00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:32,840
are the most important and yes there's

00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:35,790
there's problems of responsibility but

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,240
when someone can go in and turn it up

00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,610
and it works ninety percent of the time

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,280
that's that's compelling and if so if

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,040
you can add engineering a top apt to

00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:50,190
increase that ninety percent to 98 99 or

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,280
better and still give them the

00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,750
flexibility that's that's incredibly

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,020
compelling as opposed to some of the

00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,050
timelines that we typically enforce so

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,250
the sad fact of the matter is that

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:06,540
sixty-eight percent of corporate IT

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:08,490
projects fail think about that when you

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,200
start thinking about your timeline to

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:14,310
provision even the development side of

00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,040
the house is two months on average for a

00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:20,940
company so you've got a two month

00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,470
investment out of the gate and even at

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,760
the end of that two month investment

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:28,130
sixty-eight percent or guaranteed to

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,520
fail hmm

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:33,140
right failure is okay right failure is

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,240
going to happen you just have to accept

00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:41,840
it what you want to do is to be able to

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:47,720
fill faster and you also you also want

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,580
to ensure that you are we are getting to

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,520
the point where it we assume that

00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:56,480
failure is going to happen so

00:33:52,520 --> 00:34:00,280
traditionally we used to spend lots of

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,050
money buying impressive mainframes and

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,760
if we did it right we would have someone

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,670
from IBM who had an office in our

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,870
facility because they were there to

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:12,350
service it and they would take

00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:14,899
responsibility for keeping that up and

00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,270
that is very much like the let me

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:21,169
engineer something for you so that at

00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:22,940
3am I can still support it we then

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,149
decided you know that's great but now

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:30,290
we've got we've got these x86 machines

00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:32,659
that are cheap and they are they're

00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,340
easily disposable and the mainframe guys

00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:38,720
said yeah but you can't guarantee that

00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:40,700
they're going to be up all the time they

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,540
had a guy for that they're right who you

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:47,929
call it 3am so we took on x86 hardware

00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:51,560
right and we had things like redundant

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:55,040
power supplies we had raid for disk fell

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:59,780
over we had redundant fans and it became

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:02,840
cheaper and then we had virtualization

00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,970
right so now the the underlying hardware

00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,130
platform doesn't matter nearly as much

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:12,140
because we can move those virtual

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:14,650
machines around and we are continuing to

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,750
push ourselves towards commoditization

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,060
we are continuing to get out of the

00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:23,360
everything must stay up all of the time

00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:27,530
we will have people on site 24-7 to

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,990
ensure that it stays running and we are

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:33,560
getting much closer to we assume that

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:35,270
failure will happen and I would argue

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,900
that that is where we can start to add

00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,590
value when we start to architect things

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:45,070
much like netflix has so that

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:47,140
is okay something goes down we have

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,060
engineered our services so well rather

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:53,980
than our Hardware that it's not a

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:58,260
problem yes yes chaos monkey proactively

00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:02,800
goes and kills things right they do and

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:05,260
and yes sir so netflix has they actually

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,630
have a simian army and the simian army

00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,820
is a number of damon's that go out and

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,760
will kill machines on netflix kill

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,810
entire services maybe even take yeah

00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,590
maybe even take out an entire

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:20,550
availability zone of machines that are

00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:24,790
running in that netflix environment and

00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:27,190
in the process of killing all of those

00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,020
machines they essentially are saying if

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,240
it hurts we ought to do it more often

00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,740
until we can we have engineered

00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:39,040
ourselves to a place where it doesn't

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:41,650
hurt anymore and you know that's some of

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,830
that is automation some of that is just

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:48,520
better software engineering we've gone

00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:50,200
from we we have historically had fragile

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,570
applications that cannot tolerate

00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,140
failure and so we engineered our

00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:59,820
hardware to be incredibly resilient to

00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:03,910
tolerate faults without actually dying

00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:06,700
we're pushing closer to commodity

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:11,230
hardware with no redundancy with no

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,820
fault tolerance and the people who seem

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,190
to be the most successful at it seemed

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:19,810
to be engineering their services to

00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:22,870
tolerate the faults anyone familiar with

00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:26,590
the saying that that software is eating

00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:28,420
up the world so software really is

00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:32,770
consuming the world everything is moving

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,690
to software and so that is the place

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,280
where you need to start injecting and

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,470
this is much more of a developer

00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,990
perspective but you need to start

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:44,470
injecting your resiliency and your

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:47,080
fellow over there rather than injecting

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:51,490
it into the hardware and networking

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,170
layers because software really is

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,690
consuming the world it's making the

00:37:53,170 --> 00:38:00,160
world much cheaper to operate

00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:03,700
and we're driving down the cost of

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,430
commodity machines not that things like

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,940
Amazon are necessarily cheap but you can

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:12,010
get a virtual machine dirt cheap these

00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:17,440
days i mean amazon will rent you one of

00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:19,390
their m1 micro for free forever and you

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,940
can consume that instance forever you

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,010
can do free computing red hat will give

00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,869
you a platform as a service to run code

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:32,369
on for free forever computing resources

00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:36,819
are really in a race to the bottom and

00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:41,920
they are ever increasingly easy to

00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:44,440
consume and so people are and the

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,440
business sees that agility and says hey

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,940
we need that we don't need the six month

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,910
wait time to get a virtual machine

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,160
provision for a development environment

00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:56,500
and I would argue that they're going to

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,170
work around you the thing that they do

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,819
not have and this is this is the point

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,819
you raised they do not have the

00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:05,380
operations perspective they can get it

00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:10,300
to stay up eighty or ninety percent of

00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:13,390
the time with no problem and that will

00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:18,040
lead them to running business critical

00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:23,140
or missions critical applications at in

00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:26,220
a place that that is not architected

00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:28,390
properly from an Operations perspective

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,329
they're doing that because it's easy to

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:33,970
get around you two to go do that if you

00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:37,000
do not become a partner to those efforts

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:41,730
and say hey yeah running a single

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,329
machine in Amazon that hosts the kidney

00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:48,760
donor database is great and that'll work

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,859
ninety percent of the time but when

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,190
there's an s3 outage and you can't

00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:57,130
access the donor database and you have

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:59,170
people who actively need kidneys that's

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,270
going to be a problem but they could do

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,619
it so fast that they completely went

00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:07,320
around their operations folks and then

00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:08,370
freaked out when they had an outage so

00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,930
you have to become part of that

00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,060
conversation and telling people hey you

00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:15,680
can't go do things in the cloud or you

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:19,590
can you can't use these easily automated

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:23,550
consumable tools is not going to work

00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:27,420
people will people will innovate around

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:29,640
you because they can and you can become

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,670
either a partner to the business or you

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,480
can become a backup tape changer one of

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:39,480
my early IT friends did was a backup

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,700
tape changer in the early 80s and he

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,330
changed the massive reels from machines

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:50,790
like this on a daily basis thought he

00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:54,330
had job security forever and as we all

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,830
know you can store a lot more on very

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,740
small tapes now and they have tape

00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:02,570
libraries and we're getting to the point

00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:06,630
where we don't even use tapes anymore

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:11,640
when when this went away yes when the

00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:15,180
dell projector went away on cue when

00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,300
that went away so did his job and he

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:23,130
essentially never retrained and I think

00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:27,510
a lot of us are are in denial about the

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:30,720
state of IT and how bad how bad our

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:36,750
relationship is with the business and

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,850
how poorly we we interact towards the

00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,790
business goals with the rest of the

00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:46,350
business the simple fact of the matter

00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:48,510
is is that we exist our jobs exist not

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,690
to play with shiny new things as much as

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:54,570
we love shiny new things our jobs exists

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:57,150
to to make the business better and I

00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:59,400
think we often lose sight of that and

00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:03,600
the businesses rapidly growing tired of

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,390
us and for better or worse they are

00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,330
moving around us and we can either be

00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,550
part of that conversation or we can not

00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,700
be part of that conversation and and let

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:17,150
people walk away from us anyone

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:21,029
vehemently disagree want to flame me

00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:27,589
here publicly feel free to

00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:30,479
ah any comments questions arguments sure

00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:32,189
outside I never heard the word get up

00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:37,679
damn up before yesterday and I didn't

00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:41,900
know what it was so but tonight I keep

00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,900
in my mind to keep coming back to

00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:47,159
Dilbert to merge off the denier of

00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:49,739
information services and we're never

00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,599
more deadly than ever that or that the

00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:53,549
denier of information services and

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,189
that's what I've heard you tell me that

00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:58,409
I teashops you're becoming in and that

00:42:56,189 --> 00:43:00,269
you should not become Murdock yeah I

00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,789
think I tea shops have been that right

00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:04,529
so I mean we laugh about a bastard

00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:09,359
operator from hell but that's really

00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:11,400
what we've been right we have we have

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:17,339
created a culture of telling people no

00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:21,749
you will do it my way rather than it's

00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:24,150
it's not it's not IT organizations have

00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:26,819
been that way we are getting to the

00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:29,880
point where it is consumable and people

00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:31,919
can can erect massive infrastructure

00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,449
without involving IT whether they do it

00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:35,429
right or not is a different matter but

00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:47,069
they can do it easily they can do it

00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:49,919
fast and this is you know 15 years ago

00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:52,259
and and their IT group was going to run

00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:54,150
upgrade everybody's pc and all the

00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:55,949
developers that i was working with I was

00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,509
a consultant you know they dutifully

00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,979
stand back and let them install the

00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,299
latest operating system as soon as the

00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:00,890
guy was out of the room they go in and

00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:03,350
reboot

00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:05,420
linux now he install linux on top of and

00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,190
erase everything he had done but it was

00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,370
much easier just let him do this thing

00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:12,410
was doing something and then go back in

00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,930
set it up the way they needed it yeah

00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,030
then to argue with you and say no I

00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,470
don't want you to write because then

00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:30,020
someone may actually come and inquire

00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:34,520
what they're doing no it's not new that

00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:36,410
the problem is not new the fact that the

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,300
fact that it's much easier to get around

00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:42,010
people now to get around the IT

00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:45,530
organization is a development that is

00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:48,170
that is quite honestly robbing power

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,000
from IT operations and so people are no

00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:53,000
longer stepping back and letting them do

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,940
whatever they want they can plop down a

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,900
credit card they can have massive Hadoop

00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:02,270
infrastructure or a massive a massive

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:05,660
web presence and never have to interact

00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:09,920
with IT at all know you're a DevOps

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:12,220
person why I Gingrich why aren't they

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:20,770
sitting up their own little in-house

00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:23,360
limo or a double yes gruesome yeah also

00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,390
everyone of every presentation I've seen

00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:32,280
it says you cannot

00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:34,480
I disagree with that so so there's a

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,510
swell is that you know the date is

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,990
enhance you yes you own what you create

00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:46,750
writing in a way to but but the the

00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:49,090
thing is not price so it is how it's not

00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,410
dollars right so it's the cost of the

00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:54,190
people's time that you're employing

00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:57,030
which is the real drain the cost of a

00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,440
virtual machine in house versus

00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,360
externally yeah it's going to be cheaper

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,660
if you do it in-house you can beat

00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,820
amazon all day long a certain executive

00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,150
that works for the company that I worked

00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:13,870
for and went and quoted this in

00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,580
violation of all kinds of SEC rules he

00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:17,770
essentially went and picked out a

00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:20,980
company that was about to IPO and said

00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:23,500
hey these people were spending nine

00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:26,620
figures a year on amazon and they were

00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,710
able to reduce that by an order of

00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,750
magnitude by bringing an in-house you

00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,970
can beat amazon all day long on on

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:37,960
prices if if you're doing it in any

00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:40,930
scale but that's not the value the value

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,640
is the agility and the speed to be able

00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,520
to innovate to not keep people waiting

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,580
to hey I've got a great idea let me go

00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,040
try it out even if it fails it was you

00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:53,050
know a week to fail to find out it was a

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,060
failure it wasn't eight weeks of waiting

00:46:53,050 --> 00:47:00,660
and then a week to find out that it

00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:00,660
failed yes agility it really is

00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:12,900
that's where we have to be it yes hey

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,660
don't call me though call me at all no I

00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,329
would argue not even that I would say go

00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,280
and power them to do it on the renin and

00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:23,010
become become the enabling agent that

00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,260
says hey I see that you guys are having

00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,089
need to do this really fast allow me to

00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,520
give you the power to go and provision

00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:31,020
your own stuff this isn't production if

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,280
you want to do production let's go have

00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,380
a conversation about how to make that

00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,450
production ready but as long as we're

00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,130
saying no or we're saying all right in

00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,500
eight weeks or 12 weeks you can come

00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,839
have your resource people are going to

00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,280
walk all the way walk out of their way

00:47:42,839 --> 00:48:02,760
to get around you and go do it faster

00:47:44,280 --> 00:48:06,650
and cheaper elsewhere right I do think

00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,650
that there is still the sprawl issue

00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:13,619
yeah you forget it to the point that I

00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:16,530
see people doing reservation engine type

00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:18,780
stuff for development environments so

00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,369
you get a machine for you know a week a

00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,660
month or whatever and then we'll just

00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:27,089
automatically destroy it but yeah

00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,859
absolutely and and you can be a part of

00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:32,520
the solution or you will get innovated

00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:35,280
around and you know when I see when I

00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,190
see 80 million dollar deals that are

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,690
circum deals that are circumventing

00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:44,040
central IT at big companies I'm like

00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,780
this is 80 million dollars even though

00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,760
you're a gigantic company that's still a

00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,760
sizable chunk of money and

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,090
resources you just get away with like

00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,670
sending it out for a dollar when you can

00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,500
have it in-house but the problem is to

00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:07,570
have that kind of resource in house all

00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:11,590
the time requires sure but so you know

00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:15,070
really if you look at the KU that is

00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:17,140
salesforce com salesforce com said hey

00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,390
this is a traditional thing that you

00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:23,850
would go to IT you would spend millions

00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:25,930
of dollars to bring up a CRM system and

00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:29,470
instead we're essentially going to take

00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:31,200
that out of the IT arena and that

00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:36,760
becomes a sales or a marketing

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,950
consumption item and they are incredibly

00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,230
successful because you want to turn on

00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:42,700
salesforce com pop down a credit card 30

00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:46,150
minutes later you'll have an environment

00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:48,190
up go tell your IT department you want

00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,980
to set up a new crm system and and see

00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,170
what they come back and tell you and so

00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:56,050
I essentially make the argument that

00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:58,510
that you can either be a party to that

00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:01,119
and help enable people to get faster or

00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:04,630
we there are going to be vast numbers of

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,460
operations people out of jobs now some

00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,050
of those jobs are crappy right so if

00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,380
your job today involves carrying around

00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:14,470
a CD and installing a desktop or a

00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:17,980
server your job actually should have

00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:20,080
been obsolete five years ago and the

00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,790
company that you're that you're working

00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,560
for you're doing a disservice to because

00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:26,380
you ought to be setting up an automated

00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,840
provisioning system right there's no

00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,840
reason to manually install any operating

00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,460
system anymore but if you have that kind

00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,470
of job you are not going to have it in

00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,119
another five years it will not exist

00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,830
unless you work in a really backwards

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,510
company that is just happy to pay you

00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,510
money for doing worthless services

00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,350
they're going to have their lunch handed

00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:55,119
to them there's a there's a great story

00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:57,670
to online trading companies to online

00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:01,270
trading companies we're comparing costs

00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:02,380
and I want to say it's between e Trade

00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,160
and ameritrade and I don't remember

00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:08,160
which side this falls on but

00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:13,619
aitee was such an enabling factor for

00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:16,940
them that the company whichever one was

00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:19,319
was the most efficient if alien

00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:26,549
whichever company was the most efficient

00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:30,809
at providing providing IT services they

00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:34,470
were able to make their the cost to

00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:36,809
execute a trade so cheap that they were

00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:40,289
offering services they were offering

00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:43,589
trading services to the public at a cost

00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:46,920
that was cheaper than the actual costume

00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:50,579
for the their competitor to execute the

00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:53,490
trade internally that becomes that

00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:55,319
becomes a simple matter of attrition at

00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,910
some point right continue executing

00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:00,869
enough trades and you will you will weed

00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:03,089
out the competition and so I think that

00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:05,579
there is tremendous power that we can

00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:08,160
grant to the business but if we're just

00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:10,319
sitting there soaking up money and and

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,079
having our fiefdom making everyone come

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:17,460
ask us people will the company will go

00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,839
out of business and I really I cannot

00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,920
emphasize enough how much I would

00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:23,609
encourage you to read the Phoenix

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:29,400
project i T is out of place today where

00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:31,500
it can truly enable businesses to to be

00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,720
revolutionary they won't solve all the

00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,520
problems but there are so many things

00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:40,500
that I t can allow a business to do

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:44,240
efficiently and can make a huge

00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,559
difference in the competitive landscape

00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,880
and if you don't think about it from an

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,789
entire business perspective I think

00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:55,200
you're losing out and you're not you're

00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:57,930
not providing value as an employee and I

00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,049
despise doing business talks I would far

00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:04,260
rather talk about esoteric things about

00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:05,819
infrastructure as a service but I get

00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,250
the impression when I go around and talk

00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:09,900
to people that folks have no concept of

00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:13,020
the value that they're missing out on

00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,720
providing to their companies into the

00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:17,570
places they work at and we've gotten

00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,530
into this

00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:23,360
being very comfortable providing the no

00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:28,610
answer or the you must do it my way

00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:31,400
answer continuously so anyway i'll be

00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:35,990
around today if you want to harass me

00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:37,730
talk to me I again encourage you to read

00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,260
the Phoenix project I think it will be

00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:42,890
the most important book you read this

00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:45,370
year thanks for sticking around

00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,370
listening

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,030
most enterprises today realize that

00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,740
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,109
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,180
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:10,220
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,350
popular lately that adds that extra

00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:15,020
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,790
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,980
know is that some two-factor

00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:21,200
authentication solutions they're better

00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:24,260
than others like two-factor strong

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,510
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,490
beyond other authentication systems by

00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:31,550
being less expensive easier to implement

00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:34,010
and easier to use giving software-based

00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:36,859
token clients built to run on all major

00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:39,460
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:41,810
Android these tokens utilize a

00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:44,210
public/private key combination that's

00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,160
generated on device so there aren't any

00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,680
shared secrets flying around or

00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,560
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,420
special handling instead all keys are

00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,880
kept secure and private between the

00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,070
requesting token and your server which

00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,680
you control in-house making it the most

00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:02,359
secure way possible to perform

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,180
authentication encryption and with an

00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:07,940
extensive flexible API that support for

00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,920
protocols like L dev and radius wicked

00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,110
works with any enterprise network

your customers rely on your website or

00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,370
application if it's slower

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,310
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:45,140
and costs you money keeping your

00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:48,660
business critical systems humming along

00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,970
requires insight into what they're doing

00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,920
your system metrics tells stories

00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,930
stories that can reveal performance

00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,270
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,829
other problems but how do you keep an

00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,470
eye on all of your systems performance

00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:04,500
metrics in real-time and record this

00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:06,270
data for later analysis enter longview

00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,280
the new way to see what's really going

00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:10,440
on under the hood the long view

00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,510
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,970
of all your systems providing you with a

00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:18,329
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:20,910
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:22,680
load and network usage click a specific

00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:25,079
system to access its individual

00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,589
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:30,000
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:31,680
comprehensive network data including

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,990
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,549
available on the network tab and disk

00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,470
rights and free space on the disk

00:56:35,549 --> 00:56:40,319
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:42,839
displays usage statistics for individual

00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,000
processes the system info tab shows

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:47,250
listening services active connections

00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,380
and available updates adding long view

00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,089
to a system is easy just click the

00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,220
button copy the one line installation

00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:55,680
command then run the command on your

00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,359
linux system to complete the process the

00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,549
agent will begin collecting data and

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,400
sending it to longview then the graph

00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:03,950
start rolling

00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,350
use longview to gain visibility into

00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:10,060
your servers so when your website or app

00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,060
heats up it stays up

00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:20,400
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:22,560
way to better utilize all your resources

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,010
and it makes managing all your resources

00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:29,869
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:33,329
happening in open source the

00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:35,190
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:37,290
of the community and the speed at which

00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:39,270
these are these you know these these

00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:41,579
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:44,430
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:47,430
that really shows the power of the of

00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:49,880
the open source community it is global

00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:53,430
and it's definitely because of the users

00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:59,310
community people are extremely friendly

00:57:53,430 --> 00:58:01,140
and almost ready to help if you go an

00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:03,329
entire see any day you'll see these guys

00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,970
helping each other out and they're all

00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:07,680
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,670
product is transparent for everyone

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:13,859
everyone can look at the code base

00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:16,070
everyone can see how CloudStack is being

00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:21,599
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:24,180
everything is open in many ways it's

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:28,680
absolutely vital to the the unborn

00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:32,880
health I'll stack the most exciting

00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:35,610
event in recent memory for me was our

00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,370
first developer boot camp

00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:41,010
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:44,970
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:49,140
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:51,990
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:54,510
chairs into the room twice everything

00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:57,750
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:58:54,510 --> 00:59:00,840
is open source and so I don't think that

00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:02,580
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:05,610
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:08,160
computing and so i think it's i think

00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:09,690
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,800
about cloud computing you're really

00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:16,350
talking about open source cloud

00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:19,500
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:21,900
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:25,800
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,470
each data centers these hardware is

00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:31,950
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:34,650
to handle number one that mass scale

00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:37,830
number two it's designed to handle the

00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:40,380
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:43,920
deployments started working on cog

00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:47,250
attack over four years ago and it was

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,950
the original set of people working on it

00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:54,060
had a background of delivering software

00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:58,290
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:59:54,060 --> 01:00:01,920
lots of users actually using it high

00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:04,980
availability is the key feature multiple

01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,990
hypervisors support different network

01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,690
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:11,940
you better while step management server

01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:15,630
can be deployed in different physical

01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:17,280
machines it definitely has a huge

01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:22,290
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:24,870
there's a major movie studio that they

01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:28,050
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:30,150
to transcode video and I thought that

01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:31,770
was terribly fascinating what I found

01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:35,040
more fascinating is what they did during

01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:37,830
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,030
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,830
lunch was over they would

01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:45,090
all the instances and go back to doing

01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:46,590
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,660
so many different aspects and there's no

01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:51,060
one person that's kind of like a master

01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:55,170
of all those realms I think cloudstack

01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:57,390
as a project is going to be one of the

01:00:55,170 --> 01:01:01,440
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:06,870
most feature fallen and and robust

01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:09,800
platforms help Taylor Adams senior

01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,800
living through the clouds dag

01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,680
you

01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:33,050
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,000
ago we could not have imagined that

01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,220
asterisk would not only become the most

01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,350
widely adopted open source communication

01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:41,390
software on the planet but that it would

01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:43,910
impact the entire industry in the way

01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:45,890
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,500
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:50,480
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,550
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,960
transition of power from the hands of

01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:56,240
the traditional proprietary phone

01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,640
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,560
administrators of foam systems using

01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,790
this power our customers have created

01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,740
all sorts of business changing

01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:05,600
applications from small office phone

01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:08,090
systems to mission-critical call centres

01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,710
to international carrier networks in

01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:11,510
fact there's even an entire country

01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:14,090
those communications infrastructure runs

01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:16,010
on esters the gym has always been about

01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,720
creating technology that expands

01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,910
communications capabilities in ways that

01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,110
we could never have imagined and that's

01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:23,480
part of what's game-changing about

01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:26,180
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,280
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,410
IP phones that extends control of the

01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,150
user all the way to the desktop the

01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:33,860
launch of these new products represents

01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,960
the next phase indigenous history of

01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:38,360
innovation these are the first and only

01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:40,070
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,630
power of esters when we first discussed

01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,670
our expectations for building a family

01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:45,830
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,570
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:49,190
the team to build the phones such that

01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:51,380
they were easy to install integrate

01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:53,240
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,790
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,440
that goal user feedback is validating

01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:59,540
that when it comes to operation with

01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,970
asher space systems including our own

01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:04,550
Switchvox based product these are the

01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,840
easiest to use best integrated most

01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:08,450
interoperable products on the market

01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:10,420
today the digitally of phones will

01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,530
initially include three IP des hommes

01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,420
uniquely designed to complement any

01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:16,310
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,980
these phones are different for a number

01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:21,620
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,060
designed for use with esters secondly

01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,670
we've made it really easy to

01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,050
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:28,730
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:30,690
to access information inside of

01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,690
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:34,650
between an application and the phone

01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:36,810
additionally we've created an

01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,940
applications engine that allows users

01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:42,180
and developers to create and run their

01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,950
