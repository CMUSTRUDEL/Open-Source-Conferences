the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:20,160
linux fest visit WWDC linux fest or the

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,619
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,689
the following diamond sponsors in 2013

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,240
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,580
or is the rough day during the

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,660
conference time but my name is Caleb

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,399
Charles and I'll give you a quick agenda

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,399
if I ever get this thing to work

00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,320
basically the agenda for today I'll just

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,510
give you a little information about

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,220
myself I'll introduce the topic talk

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,520
about the process some of the best

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,930
practices and challenges and end with a

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,540
conclusion basically my name is Caleb

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,370
Charles most people call me Casey

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,040
because it's a lot easier to remember

00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:22,040
I'll respond to both if you you know see

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,780
me call me Caleb Charles okay see I'm a

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,970
government contractor in the Washington

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,660
DC area I've been a government

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,729
contractor since 1997 and I also served

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,729
as an adjunct professor at Capitol

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,770
college which is located in Laurel

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:40,160
within their computer science department

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,020
and currently i'm attending capital

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,750
college they have a doctoral program in

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,560
information assurance and my main area

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,180
of research or HCI sec as well as

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,190
security assessment one of the many

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,440
reasons why i'm conducting this

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,170
presentation today and also that's what

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,960
i've been doing for the past four years

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,000
at my place of employment i also operate

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,820
a blog the blog is called security or

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,610
calm and we are on twitter so if you

00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:14,900
like to follow us is at security orb so

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,540
let's talk about the topic one of the

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,910
things that many people in industry as

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,800
well as a lot of the compliance boards

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,260
and compliance is one of the things that

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,630
I will be stating a lot mainly because

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,090
working in the federal sector FISMA is

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,880
like our main driver for many of the

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,980
things that we do but you know we have

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,570
realized that you know security

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:40,299
assessment has become a very integral

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:43,160
part and it's being pushed heavily and

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:46,510
another thing is that we realized that

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,549
many organizations have a very diverse

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,010
operating environment I could remember

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,200
back in 2001 when I was working at the

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,720
Pentagon ninety-seven percent of our

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,970
systems were windows-based windows XP

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,500
base and depending on your task if you

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,630
were with the firewall team you have

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,370
certain tasks to access the firewall

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,920
if you were the marketing team you have

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,750
certain applications to access the tools

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,970
that you needed but for the most part

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,650
ninety-seven percent of systems came off

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:20,240
the same build now we're seeing

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,430
Macintosh we're seeing linux-based

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,670
systems and every year it seems like

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,010
that number is increasing so that's one

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,570
of the main situations that leads to the

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,820
need to conduct security assessment also

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,690
multiple applications on a system one of

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,920
the things that I've been able to

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,040
realize is that there's about 25

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,170
applications on on average 25

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,640
applications on the system and when I

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,680
talk about application I'm talking about

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,980
your outlook I'm talking about your

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,850
Microsoft Office your internet browsing

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,200
tools but I'm also talking about

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,360
applications like the avery label maker

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,280
the one that got installed three years

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,780
ago and it hasn't been updating it's

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,340
just been sitting on the computer and

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,290
that's one of the things that we run

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,750
into a lot another thing is the

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,460
distributed computing environment now

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,090
you have many people working from home

00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,549
you have remote sides you have people

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,799
logging in from all around the world and

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:24,110
again that's another thing that really

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:27,260
pushes the need to have an effective

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,510
security assessment process and lastly

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,540
is all friendly internet-enabled arm

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,330
systems these are your FTP servers your

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,530
web servers the ones that are closer to

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,810
the front lines and all your other

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,060
systems and no systems need to be

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,430
scanned and assessed a lot because

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,400
things are changing a lot so the bottom

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,320
line is the need to understand the state

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,120
of your organization's operating system

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,330
and your environment is very important

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,920
right now and again due to the nature of

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,100
me working in the federal government

00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:03,020
it's a thing that the compliance has

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,090
pushed a lot and one of the things that

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,800
we realize is that best practices state

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,370
that just doing a defensive alone

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,349
posture is not enough

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,949
many time of conducted a security

00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,719
assessment we find a bunch of findings

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,219
in the highs and mediums and you're

00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,330
talking to the system administrator and

00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,370
you're saying hey you have all these

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,990
highs and you have all these mediums how

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,849
are we going to take care of it and

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,090
their first response is that we have the

00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:29,889
firewall you know and basically just

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,770
having a defensive posture just the

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:35,590
firewall which falls under the perimeter

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,259
security model is not the proper way to

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,389
defend your network and another thing is

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:43,089
sometimes these systems do become

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,589
vulnerable themselves sometimes there is

00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,360
a fat fingering that will allow a

00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:48,520
particular rule set to go to and

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,490
sometimes there's just some miss

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,800
configuration some technology issue that

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,620
could cause some problems and one of the

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,949
things is let's say someone does bring a

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,860
laptop a USB device into your network

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,629
and the internal network if the nodes at

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,360
the bottom level are not properly patch

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,969
and properly assess malware will run

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,439
very well within that environment so

00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,330
that's another thing that we kind of

00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:20,310
push when we talk about conducting a

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:22,930
security assessment so the thing is

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,210
performing a regular security assessment

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,120
helps bridge that gap it takes you from

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,000
a very vulnerable state to state that

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,500
reduces the risk a lot it also allows

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,649
the organization to take a proactive

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,990
stance towards security during my time

00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,819
as an incident responder we were more in

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,469
the reactive States something happened

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,310
we came and fixed it we found a root

00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:48,099
cause and we continued operation we're

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,770
conducting a regular security assessment

00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:52,990
security scans audits and so forth you

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,520
take a more proactive approach so if

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,009
there is a particular vulnerability a

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,080
particular finding that can cause some

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,089
problems most of the time by doing the

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,669
proactive security assessment you're

00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:06,399
able to combat that before it actually

00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:07,449
kicks in but the bottom line is that you

00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,759
want to make sure that your organization

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,189
is safe you want to make sure that your

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,060
assets are safe and again for me you

00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:15,430
want to make sure that you're meeting

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,460
compliance because when the GAO

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,890
the IG and for those who are familiar

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,750
with a a every three years when they

00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:29,290
come around you know if things are not

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:32,860
good and it's not good for you so why is

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:37,630
it so vital most systems are unpatched

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,810
and this occurs for many reasons in my

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:44,680
experience the main reason is you have a

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:46,000
lot of lazy system administrators you

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,470
know they say they'll push it off for

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,880
later and later never comes around you

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,160
know it's just not a priority within

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,990
their task the task is as long as the

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,350
end user are able to access the

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,820
resources my job is done another big

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,650
thing is an overworked system

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,300
administrator these are the ones that

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,280
are getting phone calls all the time

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,960
you're in training with them and every

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,300
five minutes on the phone working out

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,920
you come to their sites to conduct a

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,090
security assessment and every five

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,400
minutes someone is coming to their

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,740
location asking them a question and it

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,870
just can't get to it so you have the

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,450
overworked system administrator which is

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,850
the second leading reason and the third

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,160
one is a missed inform system

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,780
administrator this is someone that has

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,230
taken a lead position because he's

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,760
probably been there for a while and he's

00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,800
just misinformed and when you're sitting

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,650
down and you talking to him about us

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,410
certs and I Ava it's like he's hearing

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:45,160
it for the first time so we run into

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:48,490
those kind of problems he also have the

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,800
issue with most compromised systems that

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,320
are unpatched but they do have a patch

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,030
that's available I don't know if anybody

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,960
remembers about like the my doom virus

00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,670
that has spread wild a few years ago the

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,130
thing is that there was a patch that was

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,500
released for that particular malware a

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:10,930
few months before it actually came in

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:13,060
and was a big media thing and in my

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,130
incident response times many of the

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,960
incidents that I responded to when we

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,610
looked at the root cause there was a

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,370
past that was available it's just that

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,120
that patch or that work around wasn't

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,850
implemented also you have some systems

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,620
that cannot be patched I was in der beek

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,810
on last

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,360
air and HD more conducted the scan of

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,950
the whole internet and when he was

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,930
sharing the results and talking about

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,750
some of the systems that he found he

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,910
found about seven windows and T systems

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,640
and everyone in the location was kind of

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,290
laughing like oh my gosh windows NT but

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,850
for me it was a funny because I know I

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,580
had at least three of those windows NT

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,980
systems in my environment and the

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,680
situation that's keeping these systems

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,800
in there is that they run customized

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,010
code for a mission-critical in situation

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,010
and when an analysis was done to

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,900
recreate the code it came out to some

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,170
crazy millions of dollars for this to

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,850
happen so management said well we need

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,400
to keep your systems let's come around

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,710
with let's try to do a workaround so

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,870
every time we conduct the security scan

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,620
the same vulnerability to show up it

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,240
can't be patched you also have other

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,150
mission-critical related things that may

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,220
come in two aspects so by conducting the

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,050
security assessment you're able to know

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,300
that ok I have these set of systems that

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,680
are here it can't be patched but we

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,420
could do some sort of work around we

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,340
could add extra firewall could increase

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,440
monitoring but it just gives you that

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,640
visual aspect and to what's going on in

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,220
your network and again it provides a

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
proactive posture toward security not a

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,100
reactive not a defensive not a

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,610
monitoring aspect a proactive aspect

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,980
which is very important and I've even

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,870
heard some people said it's an offensive

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,790
posture which I didn't agree but I've

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,310
heard it enough that I've added into the

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:12,540
slide and again for me it all comes down

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:15,360
to compliance so when we talk about

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,160
conducting these assessments there are

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,890
many different levels you have the basic

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,770
assessments and in my organization the

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:25,920
basic assessments mainly just does a

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,600
low-level scan nothing intrusive we'll

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,870
look at some of your documents to see

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,450
what SOPs you have in place you know

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,300
your vendor list if you have any systems

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,850
redundancy your contracts will do a

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,459
manual check well no

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,649
manual check we do a physical check to

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:46,430
make sure that you have proper access

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,680
into the facility that you have you know

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,870
just the basic things and this is

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,240
something that will do if we have

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,300
someone that will be connected to our

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,970
network within the near future and we'll

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,069
go in we'll do a basic assessment will

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:04,399
give some recommendations so when it's

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:07,190
time for for the partnership to actually

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,180
occur for the interconnectivity report

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,800
to be reviewed some of the basic

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,319
operations and basic controls needed in

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,660
place to connect to our network are in

00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,610
place you also have the in-depth

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,680
security assessment this is where you do

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,170
a more intrusive and credential scan in

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,600
this is where you review the documents

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,190
you make sure that they don't only meet

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,560
the FISMA requirements that you're

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,050
trying to do but they meet your basic

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,089
organization and agency requirements and

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,170
you just try to see whether they measure

00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:41,839
up to industry's best practices you also

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,670
have the external basically just running

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,420
a scan and reviewing from the external

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:50,540
process external network just to see how

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,730
you look to the external world as most

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,740
people say like at the hackers view and

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,560
again you have the internal testing

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,050
where you conduct scans where you check

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,279
for segmentation again if someone was to

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,620
bring in a USB or an effective affected

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,149
laptop how fast will this malware spread

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:13,670
how well would you be able to contain it

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:18,139
so one of the things that we've realized

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,610
is that to conduct and effective

00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,939
security assessment you need to have a

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,139
proven process from start to finish I

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:25,759
remember back when I was at the Pentagon

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,399
and they were trying to start a security

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,680
assessment process and the information

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,630
assurance guy you know stated that he

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,350
was going to do some scan in and he came

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,509
to us two days later with 30 sheets of

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,970
paper saying these are the run abilities

00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,430
that you have and we were mainly a

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,860
linux-based shop but we're seeing stuff

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,990
port 135 things that didn't make sense

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,290
and

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:54,440
it was an effective process the next the

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,540
next month he came by and it was like 10

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,100
sheets of paper we're like okay this is

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,800
better it's still not right but will

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,360
take 10 sheets of paper and then the

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,200
third month came around it was like 50

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,149
sheets of paper and the system

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,529
administrators managers and the various

00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:11,839
other people that were affected by it

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:13,160
went to the upper management saying like

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,320
hey these guys don't have to act

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,820
together these this is not right we're

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,250
getting false positive there's no

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,459
consistency so it took three tries to

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,959
get that assessment project going at the

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,660
Pentagon because it wasn't a proven

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,520
process so one of the things that you

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,250
need to have is a proven process bro

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,800
from both from the assessor side

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:37,339
something that anyone could come in and

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,820
do it repeatedly over and the same or

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,920
the same results should be occurring and

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,720
something that the people who are being

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,940
assessed the system administrators the

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,830
particular groups will have an idea of

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,410
what the process take that it doesn't

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,230
change these time this way this will

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,020
definitely add greater success better

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,140
cooperation and one of the things that

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,850
usually comes out is the report the

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,980
reports from conducting a security

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,740
assessment basically gives you a

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:10,100
short-term view of your unit your

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,380
network what needs to be fixed but as

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,040
time goes along and as you conduct more

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,300
it becomes a long-term trending tool to

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,160
show management if you're making

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,560
improvement if you're not do you need

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,950
more money more resourcing equipment so

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,079
it is benefits and conducting a security

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:31,970
assessment in the short term as well as

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:34,579
a long term so for us as a security

00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,850
assessor we pretty much follows six

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:41,329
phases the first phase is to conduct a

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,310
pre security assessment process I'll

00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,870
just kind of go through them the first

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,300
stage is to conduct a pre security

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,130
assessment process this is where you

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,760
send an engagement letter and engagement

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,230
email if it's on-site or off-site

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,940
stating that will either be coming to

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,240
your facilities on this day will you be

00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,310
able to

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,290
take us or we'll be conducting a scan on

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,529
your network do you have any big

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:07,640
projects going on just to make sure that

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:10,580
it is something that we can do you also

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,100
have the security in brief process this

00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,930
is where you talk to the system

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,899
administrators and management and all of

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,670
those who are involved just kind of

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:24,170
stating how can we access an IP address

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:28,610
you know make sure that the tcp wrappers

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:31,100
are down you know just location time the

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,870
best time to scan who will be available

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,339
like if we run into a problem which

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,959
system administrators or network

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,490
administrators that we need to contact

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,750
to make sure that we have the most

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:43,459
effective scan from there is where the

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,029
fun part starts is where you have your

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:50,029
fieldwork and again depending on the

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,670
level of Sussman if it's a basic

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,800
in-depth external or external will

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,320
determine what the field work consists

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,990
of but this is where you do manual

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,520
checks this is where you take a look at

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,800
physical security to make sure that they

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,660
have a sign-in sheet to make sure that

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,670
they have fire prevention the proper

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,689
control access in and out of the

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:16,819
processing facility you know the scans

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,860
if it's a intrusive scan if it's a

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,439
credential scanned if it's a basic scan

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:26,120
all the work all the data is collected

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:29,780
at this particular point and from there

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,880
this is where they probably won't see us

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,420
for about a day because we're processing

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,370
all this information and basically just

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,620
to give you an idea of the report it's

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,530
probably hard to see but we try to

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,809
capture all aspects of the assessment

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,620
the middle section is where we'll have

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,880
the number of hosts that was scanned if

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,650
there are different networks like you

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,320
have open network and closed network

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,679
will break that apart the number of

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,610
highs mediums lows we have our equation

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,830
that kind of states if it's green which

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,070
is acceptable yellow orange all the way

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,190
up

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,990
read again if we do document reviews if

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,930
we do other things everything is

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,630
captured on this executive report as

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,690
well as an out brief which is more

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:24,530
verbal and written information kind of

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:26,870
detail in many of our findings and once

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,490
that report is done we have in our brief

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,480
this is where we sit with all the

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,760
interested parties we talk about defined

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,340
ends the false positive we provide

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,940
recommendations we talk about the next

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,840
time that will be coming out and answer

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,190
any questions that they may have and

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,740
basically we give them about 30 days

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,930
after we perform the assessment to kind

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,780
of repair anything before this report

00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,510
goes to management so we talk about the

00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,130
time that it's do we talk about waivers

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,500
if they have a particular service that's

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,680
needed to perform a critical mission

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,240
like remote admin is one of the big

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,880
things that we find a lot in one of our

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,550
sites but they do need it to perform a

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,730
particular mission so again that usually

00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,890
gets waived and it doesn't count but it

00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:19,390
is acknowledged because it is a finding

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,550
that can't cause some problems and

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,440
lastly is the post assessment phase this

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,020
is something that is done within the

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,150
actual team this is where you talk about

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,560
any political problems that you ran into

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,210
any technical challenges for example if

00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,040
you have a particular system that

00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,800
doesn't respond to a particular port and

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,290
it locks the Machine up again that is

00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,670
documented so the next time someone else

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,060
goes out there they'll know ahead of

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,140
time not to scan that particular port

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,590
and everything is done at the

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:55,160
post-assessment securities phase from

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,350
hotels to stay at the environment the

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,240
politics that you deal with because it's

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,180
not always the case that you'll be going

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:08,810
back to the same situation and the next

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:11,090
person may need that information so one

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,950
of the things that I always like to talk

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,050
about is just kind of defining a

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,450
vulnerability assessment of pen test and

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,190
a security audit

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,040
because many people kind of use that

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,330
interchangeably and one of the things

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,800
that I could say is that when you talk

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,320
about the point of Billy assessment you

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,910
run a scan on all the systems and you

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,540
try to find all the vulnerabilities that

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:34,240
are there to repair them when you talk

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,100
about pen testing basically the goal is

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,680
just to penetrate the network so if you

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,080
find one vulnerability or two your job

00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,760
is done and when you talk about a

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,910
security audit it's more of a checklist

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,910
you check to make sure that they have

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,700
dual power that they have emergency

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,710
lights that they have logins so that's

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,330
my definition and again depending on

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,430
your organization it may be different

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:01,090
but this is the best definition I've

00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:03,460
been able to come up with and defining a

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:08,650
vulnerability assessment of pen tests as

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:10,330
well as a security audit and one of the

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,630
things is when you conduct a security

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:16,180
audit or vulnerability scan one of the

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,570
big challenges are doing a credential

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,890
skin or uncredentialed scan and system

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,900
administrators try to fight you on this

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,630
all the time and one of the things that

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,180
I kind of use in his example is that if

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,580
you go to a mechanic and the mechanic

00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,140
was to open up your car due to his

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,850
experience he could listen to the car

00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,170
and notice that there's some misfire and

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,420
that the car is running a little rough

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,910
but if you allow him to connect the

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,250
computer into the car he'll be able to

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,560
tell you which coils are misfiring and

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,670
give you much more detail and that's one

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,800
of the main difference we're conducting

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,690
the security credential scan and

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,640
uncredentialed can the uncredentialed

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,000
scan just gives you or disable define

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,950
basically on an anterior aspect whereas

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,490
with a credential scan that allows you

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,770
to go in into the registry for Windows

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,170
based systems and ssh access for

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,720
linux-based systems to catch things at

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:11,050
the application level and I actually

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,370
performed the little tests the other day

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:18,460
just to kind of show you the difference

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:21,280
the first scan to the right this was

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,930
done on a Linux system with without

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,850
using credential scans and

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:29,310
you know for someone who did a pre scan

00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,930
will say hey we're clean you know we're

00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,400
good you tell manager like yes we're

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,400
ready for these guys to come we're clean

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,400
and everything is good but when we come

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,770
in and we say okay we need a credential

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,060
access to do the scan and they're like

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,070
well what do you need credential ask us

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,120
access for you know for hacker was to

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,520
get in there not going to have

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,040
Prudential on the route credentials to

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,210
get in or super user credentials and one

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,890
of the things that we kind of remind

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,470
them is that you know in the past year

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,940
the main attack vector has been

00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,360
applications you're talking about like

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,570
Adobe applications you know and they're

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,640
at that level so us taking that extra

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:10,460
look into the application level to make

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,960
sure that those a patch are very key so

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,390
conducted the same scan on the same box

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,230
and again this was there a patch box of

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:22,050
a very secure box who were able to find

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:25,500
some additional findings the first one

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,330
was 000 with nine informational the

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,920
second one we were able to find three

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,670
mediums and again 33 informational in

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,770
organizations we really don't look at

00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,300
informations a lot but there was some

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,120
good information within the

00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,070
informational sector and one of the

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,620
things that allows you to get a good

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,520
credential scan is that you do need SSH

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,820
access so again sometimes it requires

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,470
the system administrators to do some

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:56,070
configurations if if that's not

00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:57,890
available but if the ssh wasn't accessed

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,570
and you wouldn't have credentials and

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,340
just to continue with the example even

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,460
though i know this is linux fest I kind

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,820
of did the same thing for windows 7 box

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:12,870
with windows 7 without a credential scan

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,970
it was 001 with five informational with

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,960
the credentials itself we found seven

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:22,800
highs eight mediums five loads and 172

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,200
informational so it just shows you these

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,460
box are pretty much secure that we were

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,770
able to find this

00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,720
when you go to certain sites we're

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:34,530
patching hasn't happened for a long time

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,930
or you're talking about 150 nodes these

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:42,060
numbers become exponentially a lot

00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:44,160
higher and these are just some of the

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,340
findings with the windows box it was

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:51,560
just a low netbios related but with the

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:53,580
credentials you had some system user

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,960
administrator user password never

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,970
expires a couple denial of service

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,380
information as well so it just shows you

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:06,990
the information and just like the

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,570
linux-based box you needed access to ssh

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,250
to perform credentials when it comes to

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,370
windows you need access to remote

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:18,140
registry file system and administrator

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:21,480
authentication and that brings a whole

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:24,750
set of problems to get credential access

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,020
sometimes because many of our facilities

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:32,480
use system Harding and techniques such

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:36,780
as FDC CCIS benchmark and scat and

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,390
basically this security system but for

00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,940
you to come in and perform an an

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,490
effective credential scan to get the

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,020
results that you want they have to roll

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,570
some of these configurations back

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,060
sometimes and that's where you get the

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,650
push back the politics and so forth

00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,810
that's where you have to try to sell

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,850
them and convince them that even though

00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,960
yes you have to roll roll it back this

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,210
is the only way we could get a look

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,580
inside the box and once the scan is done

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:06,000
then you could roll it back so that's

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,040
one of the challenges is getting them to

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,660
understand that what we need to do to

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,090
get a good Prudential scan is sometimes

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:18,180
make the system a little less secure we

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,070
also go through a series of checks we

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,130
check to make sure that all systems have

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,770
warning banners and not just from a

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,830
regular login but from SSH and ftp

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:31,050
because those are all attack vectors or

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:36,120
access vectors and one of the things

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:37,630
that people who conduct malicious Act

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,280
will say well

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,750
we went into ssh and we didn't see a

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,660
warning banner so we thought everything

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,610
was good so any possible way that you

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,100
could get into the system we make sure

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,530
even VPN that you get some sort of

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:54,550
warning banner or like a pre web page

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,840
then you hit next to go through we'll

00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,740
also make sure that there was some sort

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,560
of patch management on the system

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,850
anti-malware and for each environment it

00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,470
may be different but I've kind of

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:09,360
provided some of the locations that we

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:12,160
check to make sure that that is in play

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,670
we also check for file integrity what we

00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,320
use in all location is OS sec we also

00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,470
make sure that you have your firewall

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,730
and iptables in place and we make sure

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:28,090
that that there's no ssh access to rule

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,340
and believe it or not many times we run

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,470
into systems that does have that access

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,710
and that's something that still kind of

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:38,800
baffles me to this day because pretty

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:41,680
much is just like a no-no the next few

00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,620
are also some problems that we usually

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,600
run when we audit linux-based systems

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,420
when it comes to password requirements

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,880
of having a certain length having

00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,370
certain characteristics as well as

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,870
having a certain change period that's

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,480
one of the things that it seems like

00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,990
many of the system administrators that I

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,660
deal with don't do or don't know how to

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:08,650
do and you know that's one of the things

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,480
that we usually run into and again we

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,070
check for login that's another FISMA

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,140
requirement that all systems need to be

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,560
login so we make sure that they are log

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:24,280
into some centralized login system or at

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:26,590
least login locally and one of the

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,800
things is vulnerability management

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:33,010
becomes very important because you go to

00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,500
a site that has about 200 nodes and they

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:37,060
have tons of findings and their normal

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,250
reaction is okay I'll try to patch

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,230
everything today and sometimes that

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,720
could cause more problems than your

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,970
original situation so we usually try to

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,799
work out

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,100
a particular thing if you have a lot of

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,730
work allure Adobe related patches that

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,260
you try to tackle those first one of the

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,000
things that we realize also is that

00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:01,620
sometimes when you patch a high Oracle

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,240
finding that it will take care of some

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,059
of the other highs and mediums as well

00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,850
so we usually say try to take it as a

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,809
vendor a swag maybe sometimes just

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:15,450
tackle all the highs but trying to patch

00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:16,830
everything at one time from what I've

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,270
been able to experience usually cause

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,299
the system administrators a lot more

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:25,140
problems than then they definitely need

00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:28,799
to go through and again as I was talking

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,799
about compliance everything that has a

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,960
dot IO a requires vulnerability

00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,799
management patching or front of a

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:42,000
scanning as part of their compliance and

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:47,039
again fisma is the one that we follow in

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,549
the federal government and some of the

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,870
other challenges is virtualization many

00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:57,120
times a system will have two or three

00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,559
virtual hosts and the system

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,809
administrator would say well you could

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,059
scan this box but there are two of the

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:05,970
hosts that are on the system so we need

00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:08,340
to get access to that I me this to get

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,679
additional IP address or if it's bridge

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,720
or so forth but we need to scan the

00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,390
virtual host and that's usually a

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,049
contention cloud computing has been a

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:21,570
little bit of a problem mainly because

00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:24,539
they are not controlling those systems

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,580
and many cloud computing service

00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:28,890
providers don't allow you to just scan

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,740
the network so many times they have to

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,150
be some sort of prearranged situation or

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,340
try to work with the cloud computing

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,250
service provider to conduct the scans

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,730
and provide us with the data but that's

00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:45,270
usually a very time-consuming and

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:50,280
difficult situation again you have the

00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:51,810
politics you have recurrent scans just

00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,490
doing a scan today

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,430
and thinking that you're fine is

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,700
definitely not the way to go because a

00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:01,740
week or two later some vulnerability may

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,770
come out and you're not as secure as you

00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,080
were the previous week so conducting

00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:10,650
continuous scans or something that we

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,150
usually tell our agencies to do we

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,130
usually provide them with a copy of the

00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,930
scanner since we have a site license and

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,540
we set it up for them so they could do

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,580
continuous scan in and that's also part

00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,700
of the FISMA requirement is to do

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,860
continuous scanning distributed scanning

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,190
is something that we've been trying to

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,930
work out a lot mainly we have agencies

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,840
pretty much all over the country but

00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,100
we're able to play some strategic

00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,220
distributed scanners at daylight

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,020
location and we're able to do some scans

00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,850
from our corporate site or our

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,790
headquarters and it just kind of reduces

00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:50,400
on travelling patch management and pen

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,920
testing again those are other things to

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,800
kind of consider within the when

00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,810
conducting a security assessment not to

00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,250
say that I'm advertising any product but

00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:02,070
one of the products that we use a st.

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,830
and st. has a security assessment as

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,780
well as a pen testing aspect to it so

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,930
you can conduct the security assessment

00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:12,630
find defined in go over to the pen

00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,520
testing portion and run to validate to

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,370
make sure that these are false positives

00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:24,240
or false negatives or if they're really

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:26,340
exploitable so I've talked about what

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,710
vulnerability scanning the connectedness

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,320
security assessment can do for you but

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,690
there's certain things that it can't do

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,750
just like a antivirus it works pretty

00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,640
much on a script base so finding zero

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:42,570
days and malware that hasn't been

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,700
discovered yet a security scanner won't

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,710
be able to do that for you basically

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,630
what it does is eliminate the most

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:53,280
obvious and known security issues that

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:56,940
you may run run into it can't patch even

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,710
though I've heard a GFI scan guard can

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,810
conduct some patching for you but I've

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,639
never seen it work so basically the

00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,070
passion has

00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:08,929
be a manual process or used to another

00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:10,759
tool like case or on patch link and it

00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:13,759
can't determine if it's a false positive

00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:16,849
or false negative so basically you have

00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,889
to use for your knowledge the system

00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:21,469
administrators knowledge a little Google

00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:23,899
in to try to determine some of the

00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:26,659
results when it's in question if it is a

00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:31,249
false positive if it's a false positive

00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:33,799
issue that you're dealing with so to

00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:35,779
conclude basically you know I've stated

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:40,399
that taking a defensive only approach

00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:42,409
it's definitely not the way to go no one

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,589
control could really defend your network

00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:47,629
so even though I had kind of trashed the

00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:49,129
firewall in IDs in the beginning saying

00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:51,049
that you know that's not enough but

00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:54,619
basically you need everything you need

00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,989
the firewall you need two ids IPS you

00:33:54,619 --> 00:34:00,709
need the security and the security

00:33:56,989 --> 00:34:03,739
awareness all of that plays into a big

00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:07,219
part of how secure your organization is

00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:10,309
and again you know when it comes to

00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:12,319
regulatory compliance just doing the

00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:14,389
scan you've done your due diligence so

00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:15,740
if something does happen at least you

00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,750
know that you're protected because you

00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,089
did something and that's one of the

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:26,929
things that you know we try to make sure

00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:29,210
that we do all the time and just to

00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,509
conclude I just wanted to throw this in

00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:36,139
there we're having a security b-sides in

00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:38,000
DC part of the organizing team so I just

00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:40,519
wanted to kind of bring it to your

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,779
attention if anybody you know we'd like

00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:44,329
to check it out it's supposed to have

00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:47,329
like an oktoberfest time a theme to it

00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,569
as well so that should be interested but

00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:53,179
it will be a current on october 19th

00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:57,470
through to 23rd at the marriott at

00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:59,900
downtown DC and that's all I have and

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,240
I've provided some contact information

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,650
here and I'll take any questions if

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,650
anybody has any questions at this time

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,850
Associated security assessment what were

00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,430
some of the political challenges yet to

00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:22,730
deal with working with system

00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:24,500
administrators yeah one of the things

00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,340
about doing a security assessment you

00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,170
have to I guess have multiple

00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,510
personalities to kind of understand who

00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,670
you're dealing with a lot of times

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,690
you're going into their location and

00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:39,830
you're telling them that they're doing

00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,750
something wrong or their 100% sure that

00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,700
they don't have Tomcat located on the

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,100
system but the front ability scanner

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:49,970
stated that it's on there and you have

00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,920
to understand enough to kind of talk

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,770
them through with know where to look for

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,020
it in a non intrusive way so they don't

00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,480
feel like that you're you know crapping

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,240
on them and when it's once you do find

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,550
it not to jump for joy and say yeah you

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,770
see I told you you know just say you

00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:10,550
know sometimes these things happen but

00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:14,510
you also have management management are

00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:17,119
seeing high numbers and they know that

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,609
these numbers will be reported to the

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,200
agency head this might reduce the

00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:24,950
ability to stay connected to the network

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,300
so they'll push back talk about you know

00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,980
you're scanning tool may not be working

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,780
correctly because the results were

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,440
different from the first scan in the

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,700
second scan you know so it's like all of

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,369
these different things that just could

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,380
pop up you know and one of the things is

00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:41,119
you know if you miss speak as an

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,070
assessor and you say something that's

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,619
not right from that particular point

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:50,510
they try to you know unvalidated have to

00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:52,520
say because they feel like okay he made

00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,990
a mistake here you know he might be able

00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,450
to do it again and I might be able to

00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:59,210
get a couple of extra points by trying

00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,580
to trick him or try to con him to not

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,609
find not calculating these things as

00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,050
actual findings but yeah basically it's

00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:08,150
just sometimes just going to somebody's

00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,980
house and say you're not doing this

00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:16,060
right as we're the politics usually

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:16,060
start anyone else

00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:29,199
well the reason why we pick st. was

00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:32,949
mainly because it had the penetration

00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:35,879
testing aspect to it but we use multiple

00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:39,369
tools we use found stone which we find

00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:42,459
to be a little more accurate with

00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:46,689
Windows based systems as well as

00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:50,379
linux-based systems we also use nessus

00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:52,539
retina and st. and those seems to be in

00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:55,299
my opinion less accurate when it comes

00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:58,259
to linux-based systems but found stone

00:37:55,299 --> 00:38:00,369
kind of gives us a really true

00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:02,379
information when it comes to linux-based

00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:04,689
systems and I think one of the many

00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:07,809
reasons that found stone have scripts

00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:13,149
for each run abilities related to a

00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:16,029
particular exploit where I know like

00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:18,249
retina I think most of the scripts are

00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:20,139
like embedded so you might have one

00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:23,409
script i'll check for ten things and

00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:25,569
maybe somehow it kind of loses some of

00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:32,979
the ability to find a particular exploit

00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:34,989
i thank you for coming out here I know

00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:37,119
Sunday morning but you know I've

00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:39,789
definitely enjoyed this presentation and

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:44,009
again feel free to contact me and I'll

00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,009
see you guys around thank

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:05,059
your customers rely on your website or

00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,460
application if it's slower

00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:10,369
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,200
and costs you money keeping your

00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:15,690
business critical systems humming along

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,030
requires insight into what they're doing

00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,980
your system metrics tells stories

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,990
stories that can reveal performance

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,329
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,890
other problems but how do you keep an

00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:28,530
eye on all of your systems performance

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:31,589
metrics in real-time and record this

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,329
data for later analysis enter longview

00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:35,339
the new way to see what's really going

00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:37,500
on under the hood the long view

00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,569
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,030
of all your systems providing you with a

00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:45,390
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,970
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,740
load and network usage click a specific

00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,140
system to access its individual

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,650
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,060
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,740
comprehensive network data including

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,050
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,609
available on the network tab and disk

00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,530
rights and free space on the disk

00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:07,380
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,900
displays usage statistics for individual

00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,060
processes the system info tab shows

00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,310
listening services active connections

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,440
and available updates adding long view

00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,150
to a system is easy just click the

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,280
button copy the one line installation

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,740
command then run the command on your

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,450
linux system to complete the process the

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,609
agent will begin collecting data and

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,440
sending it to longview then the graph

00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:31,020
start rolling

00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,390
use longview to gain visibility into

00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,130
your servers so when your website or app

00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,130
heats up it stays up

00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,400
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,349
ago we could not have imagined that

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,540
asterisk would not only become the most

00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:51,700
widely adopted open source communication

00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,710
software on the planet but that it would

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,230
impact the entire industry in the way

00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,240
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,849
way into more than 170 countries and

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,800
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:04,900
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,310
transition of power from the hands of

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,589
the traditional proprietary phone

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:10,990
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:12,910
administrators of phone systems using

00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,140
this power our customers have created

00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,089
all sorts of business changing

00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,950
applications from small office phone

00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:20,440
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,060
the international carrier networks in

00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,830
fact there's even an entire country

00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,230
those communications infrastructure runs

00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,359
on esters the gym has always been about

00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,070
creating technology that expands

00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,260
communications capabilities in ways that

00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,430
we could never have imagined and that's

00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,830
part of what's game-changing about

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:38,530
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:40,630
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,730
IP phones that extends control of the

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,500
user all the way to the desktop the

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,210
launch of these new products represents

00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,190
the next phase indigenous history of

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,710
innovation these are the first and only

00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,420
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,980
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,990
our expectations for building a family

00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,150
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,890
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,540
the team to build the phones such that

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,730
they were easy to install integrate

00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,589
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,140
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:09,760
that goal user feedback is validating

00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,890
that when it comes to operation with

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,320
Astra space systems including our own

00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,869
Switchvox based product these are the

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,190
easiest to use best integrated most

00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:20,770
interoperable products on the market

00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,780
today the digitally phones will

00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:24,820
initially include three IP desk phones

00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,770
uniquely designed to complement any

00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,630
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,300
these phones are different for a number

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,970
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,380
designed for use with esters secondly

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,990
we've made it really easy to

00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,400
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:41,080
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,030
to access information inside of

00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,030
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,020
between an application and the phone

00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,150
additionally we've created an

00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,280
applications engine that allows users

00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,520
and developers to create and run their

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,290
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,240
done all of this at a very compelling

00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,920
price point at Digium we're always

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,020
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,540
the best value in business phone systems

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,130
and also give them the power to create

00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,290
their own solutions or any

00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:10,000
communications challenge will continue

00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,470
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,510
Astra's cooler bastard more

00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,250
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,770
asterisk and communications even easier

00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:21,300
and together we'll change the way the

00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,300
world communicates again

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,180
prospects I every way this is the way to

00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,100
better utilize all your resources and it

00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:44,160
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:49,050
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:52,410
in open source the collaborative nature

00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:55,050
and of the you know of the community and

00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:56,940
the speed at which these are these you

00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,040
know these these deficiencies these bugs

00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,650
are getting discovered and then fixed is

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,010
it like that really shows the power of

00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,630
the of the open source community it is

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,830
global and it's definitely because of

00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:17,160
the users community people are extremely

00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:18,930
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,609
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,470
these guys helping each other out and

00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:25,380
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:27,210
manner the product is transparent for

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:31,410
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:33,450
base everyone can see how cloud tech is

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:39,300
being built nothing nothing is

00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:41,970
proprietary everything is open in many

00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:46,140
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:49,920
unborn health CloudStack the most

00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:53,829
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,469
was our first developer boot camp

00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:59,109
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:44:56,469 --> 00:45:02,979
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:07,239
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:10,089
up with 87 people and had to go get more

00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:12,640
chairs in the room twice everything

00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:15,880
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,940
is open source and so I don't think that

00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,709
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,739
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:26,289
computing and so i think it's i think

00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:27,789
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:28,930
about cloud computing you're really

00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:34,479
talking about open source cloud

00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:37,509
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:39,640
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:43,900
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:46,599
in each data centers these hardware is

00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:50,079
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:52,779
to handle number one that mass scale

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,959
number two it's designed to handle the

00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:58,809
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:45:55,959 --> 00:46:03,009
deployments started working on contact

00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:06,309
over four years ago and it was the

00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:08,049
original set of people working on it had

00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:12,160
a background of delivering software

00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:16,390
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:20,019
lots of users actually using it high

00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:23,109
availability is the key feature multiple

00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:25,269
hypervisors support different network

00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:28,269
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:30,039
better while step management server can

00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:33,759
be deployed in different physical

00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:35,410
machines it definitely has a huge

00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:40,390
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:42,969
there's a major movie studio that they

00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:46,269
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:48,249
to transcode video and i thought that

00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:49,900
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:46:48,249 --> 00:46:52,940
more fascinating is what they did during

00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:55,670
lunch where they would spin up

00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,839
you know 50 or 60 game servers then as

00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,819
soon as lunch was over they would

00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:02,869
destroy all the instances and go back to

00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:04,310
doing real work CloudStack is vast it

00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:05,839
touches so many different aspects and

00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,030
there's no one person that's kind of

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:11,510
like a master of all those realms I

00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:14,180
think CloudStack as a project is going

00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:18,010
to be one of the leaders simply because

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:24,650
it's some of the most feature fallen and

00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:27,910
and robust platforms out they learn Adam

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,910
senior living through the clouds dag

00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,819
most enterprises today realize that

00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,470
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:49,839
enough to keep their network saved from

00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,910
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,950
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,079
popular lately that adds that extra

00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:58,750
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,520
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,710
know is that some two-factor

00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,930
authentication solutions they're better

00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,960
than others like two-factor strong

00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:10,240
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,190
beyond other authentication systems by

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,490
being less expensive easier to implement

00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,740
and easier to use getting software based

00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,589
token clients built to run on all major

00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:23,190
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:25,540
Android these tokens utilize a

00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:27,940
public/private key combination that's

00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,890
generated on device so there aren't any

00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,410
shared secrets flying around for

00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:35,260
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,119
special handling instead all keys are

00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,609
kept secure and private between the

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,800
requesting token and your server which

00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:43,410
you control in-house making it the most

00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,089
secure way possible to perform

00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:48,880
authentication encryption and with an
