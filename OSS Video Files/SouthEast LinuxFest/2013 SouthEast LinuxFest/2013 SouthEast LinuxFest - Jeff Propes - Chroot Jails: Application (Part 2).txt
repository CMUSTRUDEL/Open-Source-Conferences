almost entirely of p.m. diving in

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:50,309
actually making asian girl TIA this

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,920
could go wrong morning at a time this is

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,140
especially prophecy times we're hoping

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,079
that a gunner if it doesn't get to

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,930
experience the joys of building a

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,260
seizure to really very accurate so

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,299
listen is secret jails application with

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,760
that said let's get our stars alright so

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,049
now we have fixed our releases such

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,049
issues i think of photos

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:25,979
there are people so so let's start with

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,520
the simple let's start with a service

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,610
that already understands seat you so

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,909
when it's very common up let's start

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:43,439
this is HD don't look at it in fig

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:48,209
office you just have these only hear

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:54,090
anything about that versatile oh my

00:01:48,209 --> 00:02:05,190
goodness what is that told you guys see

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:09,140
that yeah let's try okay so you're not

00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,140
going to use them that's too much

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:34,480
hey excellent now I can see it in those

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,100
in the video procedure alright so

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,120
there's a whole bunch of really

00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:43,060
important information or skip right over

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,450
respect any does the research later and

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:51,310
we're going down to is this line right

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:57,850
here yeah hang on this subsystem live

00:02:51,310 --> 00:03:03,910
here too that's right because i started

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:10,030
with silver fish that so this line here

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:13,300
the subsystem tells ssh that for the

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,680
specific subsystem of SFTP this is the

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:22,660
file transfer protocol portion of ssh we

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,750
want to use a specific server now i want

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,530
to see it for the user and he's logging

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:34,690
in and can be running into this server

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:37,350
so to a chroot jail for user using this

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,420
social system i would have to go find

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,400
SFTP server to the right place the

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,840
libraries to all the business no

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,180
thankfully that's the state's

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,430
understands you want to do with it it

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,629
has

00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:03,480
eternal awesome and what this allows us

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:08,400
to do is that the sshd date will have

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:11,040
the smtp server porcelain pieces built

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,120
it but have already up here and ready to

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,650
go all the files with our we talked

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,139
earlier about how you can open a file

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,850
handle on and see if your afterwards so

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,020
it's going to have all the fun is over

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:31,669
already so with a couple change of

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,669
commands you can set up a seat

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,410
right the factors

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,510
Oh

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,210
so

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,050
now

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,810
was it go

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:39,379
look at that thanks so these two lines

00:05:43,950 --> 00:06:00,940
internal I project it's flying around

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,640
with us working very much in parallel

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:12,340
you scream so I could have this bowl

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:28,900
like this skechers director that's the

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:30,850
director ok I think that's Albany for

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,140
the most simplest case here so what this

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:38,980
is going to do this is going to see a

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:42,340
true they usually any user that belongs

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:46,150
to the secret group receives yourself in

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,640
their home directory the only tool that

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,710
will actually work properly this smtp

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,050
almost none of them more about that that

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,879
requires my rent

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,770
a deep exploration you can talk about it

00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,150
let's put this inside this comes the

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,759
really interesting part of just a lot of

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,759
progress HD now I get to restore

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:20,070
okay back when we were going to go let's

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,070
create ourselves a user

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:41,330
the mostest each recruit over to the

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:44,690
first fiction Alec Kreider group

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,690
anukriti user

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,640
a super secret password

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,910
ok so now I've sent the new user given

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,340
the password I have booked down the

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,080
Spurs right here in addition to the

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,200
group is created from user he's also

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,560
good at in this age group let's see what

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,560
happens

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,340
let's just go

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,310
well it didn't work great first again

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:14,050
let's go check that out are we going to

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:16,300
check it out clear look at this we have

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,230
found in our mock trial justice league

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,470
in ubuntu is called off the log right

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,380
hand riveted as follows cheerfully some

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,430
more muscle describing anything i'm

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:34,080
going to the logins or security anything

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,080
here with tribal on your second user

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:46,480
right here I hope that's still visible

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,430
we're going to the so here are checking

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:56,460
a pastor or we changed us to this point

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:59,260
here we're logging logging in ass testes

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,080
Tam's on this mountain of the discussion

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,290
and the nessus tht tells us just like

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,319
the chair that militia proposed

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,509
tested so this is from our prediction is

00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:19,240
earlier this edition is were picky about

00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:19,240
permissions let's go fix this

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,310
or you

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,030
now

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,339
book now

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,660
okay now it was exactly right was

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,100
commissioned stick let's go see what i

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,639
could get into there's only one

00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,639
direction

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,950
because of the way we set up the

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,910
Commission's kind of glossed over

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:16,240
wonderful smhd expects the pliers

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,030
mandates that whatever see whatever

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,080
dream you see it routed to is owned by

00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:27,640
root this group set to root and is not

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,220
right by anything else so very strict on

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,460
because we have sent me home records be

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,870
owned by users if this is HD said

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,250
there's no one can actually keep you

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:43,810
secure what happened so in this case

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:48,340
sshd knows more we do the future that's

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:53,230
come to visit administrator but this is

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:57,010
a very simple case when I go to the

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:00,190
brute I'm only seeing my home directory

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,550
enlarge it as a Caesar my entire world

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,650
is what's it awkward that's it ok wants

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,990
to go to fill out the can go on to add

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,950
C&C

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,950
also check the price india so this is

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,860
the simplest see truth you can do it's

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:21,040
absolutely premise and this is an

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,990
example of a services understands what

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,140
it makes me see through let's try this

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,649
it doesn't understand what this will be

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:36,000
a little more difficult let's have some

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:36,000
fun with this

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,540
there is

00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,380
where is the bios nine

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,730
Oh

00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,809
this is wonderful have you very going to

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,809
stop this Jerry

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,670
alright so revenue so let's try this is

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,089
this is pretty much pure do you

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:48,830
that's right good call really appreciate

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,420
it we're working together on it until

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:55,790
you need to go home so while that's

00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:00,670
doing what it's going to do let's talk

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:03,140
about steps at bar see if it has no idea

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,230
you're going to have to build river

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,970
after those environment that fools the

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,120
tool that we're doing receives for the

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,760
independence reduces everything is

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,940
requesting require students work or

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:21,620
beginning presidents at this age region

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:23,510
everything it wants to do a lot to

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,040
duplicate and that's where it comes down

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:30,920
to the rest four steps i watch you guys

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:33,380
do step one and step 33 sorry here's our

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,150
step one and step three and the most

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,570
important is to also indicated anything

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:46,340
after it back and forth over those steps

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:49,570
until we get right wow this man work and

00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,570
still we have our system

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,380
No

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:20,740
you know we can do this is a terrible

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:20,740
ugly let's go outside

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,660
very hard

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:46,640
it's probably at us you know give me

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:46,640
more down come on how many more is there

00:15:48,500 --> 00:16:03,150
oh there goes our works are interested

00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:05,839
this to time I think Peter okay so this

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:09,089
is my terrible idea starts intruders

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,570
let's try a seat removal jennex it does

00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:17,060
not know it's being seafood there's not

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,060
much let's see that

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,800
most of your work going out through so i

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,800
just go ahead escalate

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,210
this is this is

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,130
alright let's stick figure you can't go

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,130
outside that is just too slowly years

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:04,250
I shower I got me like 20 daughter I

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:17,540
could see what do we have on here no be

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:22,940
strong what's let's go ahead what's

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:26,870
what's up Dee remember they're very many

00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,880
dependencies yeah okay I don't agree

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,850
that they'll distract us from the

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,980
original so what we'll do is that will

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,930
go a little deeper into the fish i

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:40,580
guaranteed it's an hour on this i'm

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:44,690
going to the exhaustion so let's go D

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,690
let's build a home directory chroot

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,430
environment for user dead less than the

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,860
cessation I did not show this to you

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:59,240
before especially now I happened to my

00:17:51,860 --> 00:18:04,390
driver cessation as testy jus ECG Percy

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,390
Allen system or a zebra crossing

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:20,770
our safety Nursing is it is okay

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:23,020
terabyte over 14 Oh screw it mercy is

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:29,620
our seeds just perceive one with the

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,970
even region ok so here we go if you want

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,490
to autos are you just going to go to

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:36,870
consider the old mercy and enable it

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,870
there and then create

00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:00,309
alright so let's just take a place

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,309
intend to

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,830
let's go Chloe see what our singing star

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,510
currently just looks of that so our

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,760
first step is going to copy parsing

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:29,730
yourself and all these libraries in this

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,730
easier let's make

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,450
homes

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:13,730
call forwarding copy don't believe you

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:21,340
it's just a long as Larry's force it to

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:21,340
dereference live p

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,570
lifty ops die so does here

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,190
64 director

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:27,940
okay there is no other libraries to sink

00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:32,549
to hear this is the bare skeleton but we

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,549
think are secretly rough

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Marcy

00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:02,039
super marisa remember you have a rock

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:05,340
somewhere dash demon runs the other city

00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:08,730
which are also known even its there are

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,730
actually given time

00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:32,599
you're singing / Damon built across the

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,559
tip top ok exactly like the man said so

00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:41,629
we didn't get it now made you go find

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:43,190
their config file let's go and because

00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:48,249
we don't care about the project I'm just

00:22:43,190 --> 00:23:00,219
going to copy moves on the system ok

00:22:48,249 --> 00:23:00,219
fine example

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:26,620
all right do it victa to the dangers

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,280
sorrow

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:34,690
zero developer on group I don't want you

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:37,680
to do that the service definitions of

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,680
square brackets

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,920
circles in the act of terrorism ok so

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:54,120
let's have any relative this issue so

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:58,670
let's pretend for serving a day to it ok

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,670
I could Danbury wasn't a selfie felony

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:14,540
no no ok sounds like you should go fall

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,540
by ok this is going that's it

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:49,630
okay it's actually right next to it

00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:52,110
touch touch ok so i guess my sample size

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,110
bottles

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:26,870
34 and we just want to check out for the

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:30,170
 Thanks how much would agree with a

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,850
simple service we're gonna see true the

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:36,590
only thing is available is this whatever

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:39,290
our definition now let's say that we're

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:42,830
using an old version of arsal because

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:46,220
we're stupid and this version of our

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:50,420
state has flawed unless we taking the

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:53,330
edge of the fall and take control if

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,640
this happens let's look at all the

00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:00,170
possible things that someone to do the

00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,180
seizure the list is virtually the only

00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:07,210
thing we have nasty directories or

00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,210
simply thing we have our other libraries

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,130
one binary and slash user slash bin and

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,450
the sympathy stick a good transfer data

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,700
but that's going to happen to it because

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,250
your service of the data is racing to it

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,500
today's attractions are so what we've

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,630
done here in 10 minutes that were

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,420
strolling around as creating a

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,360
relatively secure environment for our

00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,820
sink to live inside if someone breaks

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,290
into RC or something happens the

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:41,510
corruption will stop at district so the

00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,640
rest of my system said I have some very

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:49,100
important files that I just can't

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:51,560
possible without those are also take and

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,120
our sink is running happens in our army

00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,510
who gave it everything it needed to

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,900
exist and that's all of these will be

00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,900
sleepy

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:13,790
no because one wish per galaxy reach it

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:16,190
is using as a route you can change

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:27,440
drivers around you can access / all

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:31,430
directives there's a very well-known

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:36,950
example for how to break out of jail you

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:40,880
won't have to look very hard deficit and

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:43,419
requires someone to be root or do this

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,049
so this case is running

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:50,779
you're doing is writing we're delighted

00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:54,169
normally right to outside that's stupid

00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:57,679
so one of the things you never want to

00:27:54,169 --> 00:28:01,129
do in your cv and i was using ping

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,349
earlier to talk about that you never put

00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:06,529
anything that is set watching you two

00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:10,519
nothing is wrong or nothing that can

00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:13,239
mean period crystal because that gives

00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:20,479
someone the means to break out of jail

00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:23,239
open jail is security isolation so now

00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:25,519
here's an interesting all these files i

00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:28,639
confident to the CEO trajectory they're

00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,519
all this work I want to make a

00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:33,349
distinction here files can be home by

00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:37,179
room looks like that's common in the

00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:48,589
states you too they just cannot be made

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:52,639
by others pain let's check that pink is

00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:56,029
a pretty much requires that pink is

00:28:52,639 --> 00:29:00,649
something that should never ever so your

00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:02,749
CJ because of you remain a winner you

00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:07,029
are king because it's actually

00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:09,259
manipulating millally I just passed me

00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:12,679
so this should never be in your

00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:16,249
situation this is kind of ironic here as

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:19,519
a tool called busy box which I've used

00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:22,039
before to build very very strong user

00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,169
advisors and actually that thing two of

00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,809
which doesn't work because unless you

00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:32,719
set the busybox going to be set do any

00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:33,979
group ok so I'm actually a lot of right

00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,929
so that was a pretty good intermediate

00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:39,109
example let's take me something up let's

00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:44,989
do a full home directory right we use my

00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:49,580
action let's go to do your test users

00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:54,259
directory so when I long and the bestest

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:55,520
each i dot at the console the program

00:29:54,259 --> 00:30:01,210
that I've doggone too

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,210
fashion so right for that Miller Beck

00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:23,590
Nona moved in for boom he goes to

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:34,780
let's check out all this is actually I

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:40,090
the booster antenna for the sisters

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:43,270
about nine guys are really good now

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,140
there's run into some issues here having

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:49,330
done this before there are some pieces

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,130
that are not listed with this you're

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,520
still manual which we're going to hit

00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:57,370
that and hopefully by sharing this with

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,260
you I'll say to the paper because

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,150
brother reason I might hear something

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:06,570
it's because I talked about or procedure

00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,570
gym so let's copy duties

00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,320
for second dinner teachers

00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,220
precision

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:12,620
we're too big look pale we've got teams

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:12,620
on the c64

00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:23,830
just bring 11 understand all those

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,950
libraries are what they do there's an

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:31,410
amazing amount of depth start going into

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:34,660
this 30 to stop please I got fascinated

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:38,200
so let's see what happens with just our

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:42,400
simple little shell here we've got 15

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:49,780
bash our birth quarter let's go all to

00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:54,610
me that's a pseudo letter I don't

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:57,280
understand why I do that yes this right

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,740
here this time it's not a real library

00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,770
some kind of ugly our critics left

00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,990
behind the whole ed program pictures up

00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:18,030
soon

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:21,030
leopard look like yeah so you can safely

00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:23,340
over song and I guess I glossed over

00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:26,490
here because it didn't have that how can

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:36,710
i copy of the business so let's see what

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:40,880
happens that's what for test users I

00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,880
thought we think that didn't fix it

00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:52,040
alright so I don't think we making

00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:52,040
changes here yes you're teaching itself

00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:20,929
that works oh whoops we don't have an

00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:24,799
angle so we actually really long at to

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:28,960
test it we have a shell what there's

00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:31,250
nothing to do there is four to go

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,809
there's nothing to do so we kind of

00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:42,379
missed a couple of things of the home

00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:47,720
buyer expects let's go back I like the

00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:53,000
baby thing I'm also scared ok let's go

00:34:47,720 --> 00:35:01,609
into context teacher so he's got a

00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:07,099
couple to its people ok everything LSN

00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:08,630
by so good of course we're just Adam to

00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:12,799
tool we have to check and see hold up

00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:15,380
why ok this video's so you see this is

00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:20,630
treadmill year of life eventually you

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:25,940
get to this point where you stop is

00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:31,819
 all libraries ok it's not

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:33,170
sustainable let's see do you want to

00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:39,049
enter 10 megabytes and every single

00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:41,850
holder home users / if i go i could do

00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:51,630
that I've also done

00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:56,100
yes before we really shouldn't that's

00:35:51,630 --> 00:36:02,610
right now I was in a gnarly they just

00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:06,110
got so then we came to Turkish now same

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,110
things won't go outside with your truth

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:16,530
partly that one to all of your users

00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:24,270
figure central cotton for all done

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:26,910
secretly how I tend to handle things if

00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:29,580
I'm doing lots of Secrets for users

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,490
actually centralised seats group

00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:35,700
environment they used to be called here

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:39,470
in FS constant supply with aufs this is

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,490
a little technology where you can layer

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,800
different directories and call all the

00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:46,230
same thing so I'm going to layer the

00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,010
lowest layers would be my seafood on top

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,480
then another layer users home fries and

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,480
what happens when a reader cluster like

00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,630
Christmas shoot it falls through so if

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,340
someone is modified whether the

00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,370
malicious or justified or whatever is a

00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,710
lot about under this later it will match

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,240
this at least here so someone wants to

00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,190
start back around he can move back

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:21,460
and also this means i have one layer to

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:26,050
maintain one see you jo-jo that's a like

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,050
the here we remain in partnership with

00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:47,990
nature so which of these do not already

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:50,770
have SC max we don't have one here don't

00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,770
have led a co

00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:01,270
you don't have whipped III why we want

00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:07,900
to do this one here this is this is just

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:10,710
for a lesson so you can see how long one

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,920
of binaries are not programmed situation

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:18,040
they're not made to be easy like content

00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,630
will dash out to all the libraries and

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,580
there's something I have a notion here I

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,619
Russian boosters now each of these

00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,630
libraries could themselves have the

00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:27,000
tendency to another library I was

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,910
actually going to run into that problem

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:37,320
that looks like the 1204 they fixed so

00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:37,320
an easy be you had to bring in NSS NSS

00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:44,710
family of libraries for paddle miss

00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:49,410
asleep at DSS to that final moments

00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,410
wonderful job just to get that and

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:13,250
I meant to do this how are ya

00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:29,849
maybe an aversion that we used before

00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:31,170
did that disturbing news do so and we

00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:33,119
talked at the very beginning of the

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,279
first session can I care about tools

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,690
that help me build secret jails that's

00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:39,150
more or less what those students are

00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,039
doing they're doing an LED on the binary

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:45,180
response and who need all these things

00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:47,880
go mate but they're imperfect because as

00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,609
we saw we copied all this sarah vibrator

00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,130
RC to work and it still didn't work

00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:57,299
because we like configuration file these

00:39:53,130 --> 00:40:00,480
uh many jail tools or feature better

00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:02,720
have the same exact problem so this is

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
where

00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:11,499
ok brothers Jeff banister yes sir

00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,640
crafts crap so it's kind of happiness

00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,869
you don't always know it's one of the

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,059
things you learn through experience and

00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:28,059
doing tomorrow that's

00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,150
write a script

00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,230
they have done that the question for the

00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,060
video is to sell enough for someone more

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,870
clever they can write a script led

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:49,740
recursively and copy this so that's

00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:52,600
where those tools like nick j light does

00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,340
make jail actually i think goes way

00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,650
beyond back under engineers the

00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:01,840
solutions to be far worse than just a

00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:06,520
lady think every school for jail tool

00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:08,440
will do that it's a good exercise to

00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:15,640
understand all they took the pieces i'm

00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:18,160
going to go fishing only eat now what

00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,540
now you're talking about oh and you'll

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,200
be talking about that on sunday if you

00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:26,050
come to my session so let's see this

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:33,010
library as s dependencies limpiar almost

00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:33,819
anita one the year they have really put

00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:38,109
this up

00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:48,069
I used to be 1004 I'm really happy to

00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:57,999
talk before you come in on time and we

00:41:48,069 --> 00:42:01,289
copied all of our we got se1 extra god

00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:01,289
you're early

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:23,430
we go to here with a CL the a blip see

00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,230
to do

00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,900
coming up no I don't know

00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:54,010
okay so conceivably we have filled all

00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:55,780
the farmers for possible see that

00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:00,220
actually pretty great so we saw it

00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:02,760
didn't work before it wasn't let's see

00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,760
what happens

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:12,890
we're going to get moved to Phoenix so

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,570
now we have removed one of the libraries

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:20,710
which depends what is it going to go

00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,710
going to give you that I system so

00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:35,980
aromatic survivors k 5 this is when the

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:39,830
easy way to know something's broke so

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:46,270
sometimes we run into trouble with tools

00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:49,940
like this let's say I have some long

00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:52,510
pasted my favorite eight yrs less let's

00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,510
caucus

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:05,750
all right don't you order boxercise know

00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,750
about murders in curses

00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:29,700
here we have our side so let's company

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,320
not very long so let's go drop this into

00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,320
this

00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,290
okay what is that

00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:06,860
that we got a weird area here Profar

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,030
less the less primary assets libraries

00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,270
like it's expected with the dead

00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:13,040
processor still missing something spares

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:28,060
me be clear were to pay something

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:28,060
terminal what is it okay term cap okay

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,180
extension

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:56,680
where is this talk about they need it

00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,089
memory

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,540
let's roll it out

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,260
reduced also ours

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,880
she

00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:47,550
I don't know okay so we're we need to do

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,410
to take this exact structure we're going

00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:51,960
to make a very very forced option and

00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,690
every single person log on to this user

00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,510
who's using a Digimon can travel shop

00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,940
detection a poor decision but we're

00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:02,040
society ahead of time rather than copy

00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,740
every in we're top in one piece it over

00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,260
our principle of least privilege this is

00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:11,930
the least amount of functionality

00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,930
partager sober let's go

00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:45,190
113 director you just created now I see

00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:47,770
you know why my company teeth this and

00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:50,640
I'm going topless you're going to copy

00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,640
extra quarters

00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:04,670
65 next time gt6

00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,910
please

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,789
user

00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:25,830
it's 256-color copy this into our

00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:40,150
half-price so now we have a copy of our

00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:45,280
Western desk a particular see doors now

00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:48,040
it's working so there was the example

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,820
and that happened just get that Manila

00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:54,580
Raja there let's say that we didn't know

00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:58,900
why I was work how will we find out

00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:02,550
what's going on estrace perfect what's

00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,550
easiest Ric 2 i'm going to tip over

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:22,940
it's also very good up a little external

00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:25,850
too ok so now this is no longer good

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:29,000
work cuz we don't have it we're trying

00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:33,950
to figure out why don't you want let's

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,790
put this trace us on our senior another

00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,790
hour long

00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,160
thankfully blessedly estrace knows that

00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:54,769
this is going to happen so that kept

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:57,720
their number of our library thank you

00:49:54,769 --> 00:50:09,380
okay so now i'm going to yesterday's

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:09,380
less profile place for testing

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:20,569
location now the problem was we had no

00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,920
directories in this home directory of

00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:24,170
test leaders where he could actually

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,539
write off with your best rate all day

00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:30,430
long we couldn't say I just have a

00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:44,619
temper of excitation a place for you

00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:47,269
okay i'm going to list race okay now i

00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:49,700
would love to look at this violence i

00:50:47,269 --> 00:50:51,619
see true except a very cool i need to

00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:56,240
look at it is the one that's number

00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:59,180
three so we're in a position to hear

00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,559
where everything is working as on that's

00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,700
because he wants to gotta sell stuff ok

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,960
we're looking specifically by said

00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,609
earlier you're looking at estrace

00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,390
information you're looking for things

00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:16,549
like opens rice stats and needs were

00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:18,950
looking for yeah there we go one of the

00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:21,259
things you'll finally starting to SJC is

00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:24,140
the colonel actually look in multiple

00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:27,360
places for your library that's where

00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,760
these LD notice that a pillow

00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,680
the only student at those files the

00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,540
basement pre cashing locations of break

00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,960
laboratories they are not strictly

00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:41,250
required your part one is certainly help

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:45,030
its finding its libraries fast so we're

00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:47,510
going through fear it is going through

00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:50,610
bring curses in the hostess locations

00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:57,360
right here middle they see the finally

00:51:50,610 --> 00:52:00,330
find take great notes day and we just

00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,350
contacts out that's understand you're

00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:09,800
going another library the lib do same

00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:09,800
thing all those are looking good t info

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,030
ok so here we see this is where we are

00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:21,050
first clue for ice racing its program

00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:25,840
our first clue that they will

00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:35,840
which empowers its static these files

00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:37,310
status of status so that staff tells me

00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,380
all the information about the file its

00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:46,940
purpose no access I've changed missions

00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:49,220
so you see in s traces a lot in estrus

00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,350
you'll see a program static file servers

00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,630
that will verify to exist and then

00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:55,700
actually go leave so here we see it

00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:59,690
standing in rapid succession looking for

00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:03,950
a dr. Monroe a / etsy /em live terminal

00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:06,020
it's not finding it actually hear it

00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,120
found this director of the term affair

00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:12,530
when it starts going looking for those

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:17,090
files doesn't fight so it can't find an

00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:18,860
appropriate finally max do sir it's

00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:21,170
looking all over the place a whole time

00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:24,830
to the operation any one of these things

00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:27,410
will allow it to do its work so part of

00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:30,080
the investigative flying ability see

00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:32,420
truth is there's not a different way to

00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:37,220
solve this it's a good problem always

00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:41,420
technical people come info sis's little

00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:46,700
cat house anymore look like this all the

00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:49,430
stuff it may be takes 10 here's another

00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:52,060
interesting it's trying to open that why

00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:54,830
we don't have that inner city trip so

00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:58,800
I'm actually not sure how has work for

00:53:54,830 --> 00:54:03,160
property I was Congress

00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:05,380
it didn't so like I said this could go

00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,090
horribly there's lots of little nooks

00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,550
and crannies and things to understand

00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:12,070
and learn explore the ability to root

00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:15,310
source lots of problem solving on the

00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:17,710
fly requirements for our standing and

00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,570
we're diving pretty deep and assistant

00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,100
understand this game we're having a head

00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:26,260
we're going to get a system call for

00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:28,990
these ones be these programs me so but

00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:30,430
here we see the tools we use the only

00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,110
detail when you see yesterday's to a

00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,110
wearable successfully build a home

00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:40,210
environment for user that's a secret

00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:42,940
service who play with ssh we've covered

00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:46,900
just all the major cases so when you're

00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:50,680
doing a truce you now put with the basic

00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:54,250
stability that upscaling you got fine

00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,860
hair tools from here to really seriously

00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:59,470
really secrets for on use of our users

00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:03,670
home directory i will look into the tool

00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:08,080
busybox amazing pieces of advice so I'm

00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:11,640
critical tools down to 600 use really

00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,640
awesome busybox

00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:19,839
this is the shell and function to this

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,410
LS always always buyer you would expect

00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:25,030
to see a busy box tasting most comedy

00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:28,950
opportunity function I mean you

00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,950
shouldn't put some in a while back okay

00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:35,829
actually it's if you use these boxes to

00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,760
show then we'll entrepreneurial to use

00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:42,760
another prime ministership then you'll

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,730
have to make sandwich but she busy box

00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,900
plastic off of modes of operation I'm

00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,700
going to ask that's a little too much

00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,339
debt for us to go to hear there's want

00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:56,050
to make a very versatile building see

00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:59,380
its roots with using busy box you can on

00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,730
that we have a shower ACH really helps

00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:05,140
you to troubleshoot us what I like

00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:06,400
adjusted so I think that's a lot of time

00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:11,740
the car do you guys have any questions

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,860
so there was a firm yes one of the

00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:22,480
things

00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:26,590
not right now not right yeah why is

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:32,080
about not at sea because it's difficult

00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:37,600
because it requires per se D kinky oh

00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:39,520
yes he was asking he must have not why

00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,090
would you not want to see me through all

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:46,660
of your services or at least Apache

00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:50,640
specific because the difficulty involved

00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:53,670
in maintaining a patch is highly modular

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,140
different modules man that requirements

00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:57,790
it requires an in-depth understanding we

00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:00,520
had to investigate the tools we're using

00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,620
the more complex the tool we see drew

00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:06,160
the more complex the requirements are

00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:09,040
assisting it then some point it is to be

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,290
so large you just say we don't have time

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:14,170
to do this is going to take two of two

00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:16,630
hard to maintain again that's part of

00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,540
your risk analysis maybe you decide that

00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:22,690
it's too risky around the conversation

00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:24,550
htp visa that's all part of a risk

00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,550
assessment up front and decidedly

00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:33,100
distinction that's a very good

00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:36,960
question anybody under the bush before

00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:40,150
yeah these things are seeing

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,250
we are in the first session the question

00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,710
was the new space for using speech read

00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:47,080
verses in lrc container I mentioned you

00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:49,750
the first session that I've seen is kind

00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:52,440
of a step up from future sparse simpler

00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:55,030
and something about this particular

00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,760
presentation about the top of you that

00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:03,280
letter actually this general talk about

00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:05,410
marriages they are more advanced and for

00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,300
more securely reproduce but I think it

00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,730
order to understand with understand our

00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:15,070
student yet understand that this is so

00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:17,400
that's what any other questions yes just

00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,400
talking

00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:30,940
what nation or any challenge that spirit

00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:30,940
wise Jeff altricial as well

00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:41,500
that's a good question is question was

00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,540
when you're trying to entertain and

00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,150
you're logging the law to an extra four

00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,550
city outside the sea group are their

00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:51,460
challenges associated that answers very

00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:56,050
yes that's proper english for that when

00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:58,510
a fish in there yes there's many

00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:05,220
different ways to handle this simple way

00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:05,220
would be set up say a socket inside that

00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:29,080
mercury and all the long see that's the

00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:31,060
news Houston he's done Association for

00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:34,240
it again you die now 2 soccer for

00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:35,860
several places that's what the

00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,020
situations where I don't know you keep

00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:41,920
scaring that up I would maybe look into

00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:44,710
using a TCP socket was dead and i notice

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,020
this level also do to see people yet to

00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:49,630
set up the access controls probably but

00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,280
some point can just decide this is too

00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:54,380
hard to maintain our cloud-based method

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,380
use a socket wrench method instead

00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:03,470
it could be performance hits like that

00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:09,470
that all goes again to your decision the

01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:11,530
attacker one more request bail okay very

01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,530
good

01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:33,130
most enterprises today realize that

01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:34,780
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,150
enough to keep their network saved from

01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,220
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:41,260
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:43,390
popular lately that adds that extra

01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:46,060
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:47,830
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,020
know is that some two-factor

01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:52,240
authentication solutions they're better

01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:55,270
than others like two-factor strong

01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,550
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:59,500
beyond other authentication systems by

01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:02,590
being less expensive easier to implement

01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:05,050
and easier to use giving software-based

01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:07,900
token clients built to run on all major

01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:10,500
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:12,850
Android these tokens utilize a

01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,250
public/private key combination that's

01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:17,200
generated on device so there aren't any

01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:19,720
shared secrets flying around for

01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,570
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,430
special handling instead all keys are

01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:26,920
kept secure and private between the

01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:29,110
requesting token and your server which

01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,720
you control in-house making it the most

01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:33,400
secure way possible to perform

01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,190
authentication encryption and with an

01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,980
extensive flexible API and support for

01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,960
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:42,330
works with any enterprise network

01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,840
architecture

01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:47,450

download your wicked free trial today

01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:51,210
regardless of whether you're considering

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,010
two-factor authentication for the first

01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:56,250
time we're just ready to ditch your

01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:58,650
existing expensive key file system we

01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:03,590
can help with easy to implement easy to

01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:03,590
use strong authentication from wicked

01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,620
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:14,570
ago we could not have imagined that

01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,760
asterisk would not only become the most

01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:18,920
widely adopted open source communication

01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,930
software on the planet but that it would

01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,450
impact the entire industry in the way

01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,430
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:28,070
way into more than 170 countries and

01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:30,020
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:32,090
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,530
transition of power from the hands of

01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:35,810
the traditional proprietary phone

01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:38,210
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:40,130
administrators of phone systems using

01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,360
this power our customers have created

01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:43,310
all sorts of business changing

01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,140
applications from small office phone

01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,660
systems to mission-critical call centres

01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,280
the international carrier networks in

01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,050
fact there's even an entire country

01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,660
those communications infrastructure runs

01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:55,580
on esters the gym has always been about

01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,290
creating technology that expands

01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:59,480
communications capabilities in ways that

01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:00,650
we could never have imagined and that's

01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,050
part of what's game-changing about

01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:05,750
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:07,850
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,950
IP phones that extends control of the

01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:11,720
user all the way to the desktop the

01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,430
launch of these new products represents

01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,530
the next phase indigenous history of

01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:17,930
innovation these are the first and only

01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:19,640
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,200
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,210
our expectations for building a family

01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,370
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:27,110
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:28,760
the team to build the phones such that

01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:30,950
they were easy to install integrate

01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:32,810
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:35,360
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:36,980
that goal user feedback is validating

01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,110
that when it comes to operation with

01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,540
Astra space systems including our own

01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:44,120
Switchvox based product these are the

01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:45,410
easiest to use best integrated most

01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,990
interoperable products on the market

01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:50,000
today the digitally phones will

01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:52,040
initially include three IP desk phones

01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,990
uniquely designed to complement any

01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,850
asterisks or switch box based solution

01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:58,520
these phones are different for a number

01:03:55,850 --> 01:04:01,190
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,600
designed for use with esters secondly

01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:04,210
we've made it really easy to

01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,620
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:08,300
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:10,010
to access information inside of

01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,340
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:14,010
between an application

01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:16,380
and the phone additionally we've created

01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:18,510
an applications engine that allows users

01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,090
and developers to create and run their

01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:23,160
own apps on the following and finally

01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:25,230
we've done all of this at a very

01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,910
compelling price point at Digium we're

01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,710
always thinking of ways to give our

01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:31,080
customers the best value in business

01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:32,940
phone systems and also give them the

01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,100
power to create their own solutions or

01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,990
any communications challenge well

01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,670
continue to push the boundaries not only

01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:40,680
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,330
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,820
asterisk and what communications even

01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:48,500
easier and together we'll change the way

01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,500
the world communicates again

01:04:55,810 --> 01:05:00,080
your customers rely on your website or

01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,480
application if it's slower

01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,420
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,250
and costs you money keeping your

01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:10,750
business critical systems humming along

01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:13,060
requires insight into what they're doing

01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:15,010
your system metrics tells stories

01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:17,020
stories that can reveal performance

01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:19,360
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,920
other problems but how do you keep an

01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,560
eye on all of your systems performance

01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,590
metrics in real-time and record this

01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:28,360
data for later analysis enter longview

01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,370
the new way to see what's really going

01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,530
on under the hood the long view

01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:34,600
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:37,060
of all your systems providing you with a

01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:40,420
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:43,000
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,770
load and network usage click a specific

01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,170
system to access its individual

01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:49,680
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:52,090
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,740
comprehensive network data including

01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:56,080
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,640
available on the network tab and disk

01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,560
rights and free space on the disk

01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:02,380
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,930
displays usage statistics for individual

01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:07,090
processes the system info tab shows

01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,340
listening services active connections

01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:11,470
and available updates adding long view

01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,180
to a system is easy just click the

01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:15,310
button copy the one line installation

01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,770
command then run the command on your

01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,450
linux system to complete the process the

01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:21,640
agent will begin collecting data and

01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:23,440
sending it to longview then the graph

01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,050
start rolling

01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,420
used longview to gain visibility into

01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:32,160
your servers so when your website or app

01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,160
heats up it stays up

01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,790
you

01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:13,170
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:15,329
way to better utilize all your resources

01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:18,780
and it makes managing all your resources

01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:22,609
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:26,130
happening in open source the

01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:27,930
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,849
of the community and the speed at which

01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:32,040
these are these you know these

01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:34,349
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,930
discovered and then fixed is it like

01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:39,660
that really shows the power of the you

01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:41,280
know of the open source community it is

01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:45,480
global and it's definitely because of

01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:51,810
the users community people are extremely

01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:53,550
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:55,260
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:57,119
these guys helping each other out and

01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:00,030
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,859
manner the product is transparent for

01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:06,060
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:08,069
base everyone can see how close darkest

01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:13,950
is being built nothing nothing is

01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:16,589
proprietary everything is open in many

01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:20,790
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:24,569
ongoing health cloudstack the most

01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:28,460
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:31,100
was our first developer boot camp

01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:33,770
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:37,730
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:41,900
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:44,719
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:47,270
chairs in the room twice everything

01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:50,600
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:53,569
is open source and so I don't think that

01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,339
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:58,370
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:08:55,339 --> 01:09:01,069
computing and so i think it's i think

01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:02,450
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:03,560
about cloud computing you're really

01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:09,109
talking about open source cloud

01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:12,140
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:14,270
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:18,529
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:21,230
in each data centers these hardware is

01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:24,710
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:27,410
to handle number one that mass scale

01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:30,589
number two it's designed to handle the

01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:33,469
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:37,640
deployments started working on contact

01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:40,910
over four years ago and it was the

01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,680
original set of people working on it had

01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:46,790
a background of delivering software

01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:51,049
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:54,650
lots of users actually using it high

01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:57,739
availability is a key feature multiple

01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:59,750
hypervisors support different network

01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:02,420
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,700
you better while step management server

01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:08,390
can be deployed in different physical

01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:10,040
machines it definitely has a huge

01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:15,020
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:17,600
there's a major movie studio that they

01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:20,810
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,880
to transcode video and I thought that

01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:24,530
was terribly fascinating what I found

01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,800
more fascinating is what they did during

01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:30,590
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,969
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,550
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:35,820
the instance

01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:38,369
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:40,170
vast it touches so many different

01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:42,030
aspects and there's no one person that's

01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:45,420
kind of like a master of all those

01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:48,570
realms I think cloudstack as a project

01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,849
is going to be one of the leaders simply

01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:55,920
because it's some of the most feature

01:10:50,849 --> 01:11:00,000
Folan and and robust platforms out they

01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,540
learn a ton senior living through the

01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,540
clouds dag
