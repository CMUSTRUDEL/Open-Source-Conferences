the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,860

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,619
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,830
linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,609
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,130
possible so i'm here to talk about

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,009
military open-source software my name is

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,320
Winston Messer in my day job hat I work

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,520
for Georgia Tech as a researcher but

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,989
what I'm talking about today is this

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,530
group mil OSS that I've been working

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,520
with for the past three or so years

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,440
currently I'm the chairman of the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
steering committee I say currently

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,100
because that's a position with very

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,809
short term limits and I've only been

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,510
doing it for about a couple months so

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm really new to it usual disclaimers

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,160
apply I have a ton of slides death by

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,359
PowerPoint is really real I can't tell

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,489
you what the symptoms are but you'll

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,299
know if you have them so be careful

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,729
somebody could get hurt and before we

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,900
get too far into it because we know in

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,250
the open source community there's about

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,799
a million definitions of what open

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,479
source means and some of them are open

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,310
source friendly definitions where it's

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,869
more like free software and some of them

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,000
just mean here's the source code don't

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,520
touch it don't use it don't redistribute

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,229
it so when talking about open source

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,900
within the top of Department of Defense

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,810
this is the official DoD definition of

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,979
open source software it's software where

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,540
the human readable source code is

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,979
available for you study reuse

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,780
modification enhancement and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,450
redistribution by the users of that

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,310
software so immediately to really cool

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,270
things are visible one is that that

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,770
definition is a hundred percent

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,360
compatible with the free software

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,640
foundation's definition of open source

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
and second that it is also a hundred

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,770
percent compatible with the open-source

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,540
initiatives OSD open source definition

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,479
DOD always uses open source software

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,460
spelled out or the abbreviation OSS all

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,490
caps they don't hyphenate open source

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:09,149
which isn't useful information but the

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:10,709
more you know so here's who melissa is

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,870
and this is a slide that i copied from

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,890
our website we're a grassroots

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,200
organization of

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,060
people connecting open-source with the

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,430
Department of Defense most of our

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,040
members work for with the DoD either

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,790
directly or as contractors and see our

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,230
work in open source as patriotic

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,720
contributions supporting our nation's

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,170
war fighters a little bit of history

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,550
melissa s got started in 2003 when a

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,560
researcher was working with marine

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,600
trying to find how they could release

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,730
one of their projects as open source and

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,069
nobody really had a great idea on how to

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,450
do that and as that conversation sort of

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,860
expanded and starting to include more

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,239
and more people who were really good at

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,400
policy and really good at open source

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,010
those guys got together and started the

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,690
organization 2008 was really our big

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,360
landmark year for us we had our first

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,800
working group which is our version of

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,890
something sort of like a conference not

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,140
dissimilar from this and also mill OSS

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,090
joined open source for America as one of

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,670
its working groups and we've been

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,260
working with osfa since then this is our

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,880
mission statement it's a direct copy

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,560
pace from the website I'm not going to

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,940
read this to you I did provide it

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,160
hopefully though if you want to read it

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,049
to yourself but the bottom line is that

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,940
we want mill OSS to help the government

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,980
make better use of taxpayer dollars and

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,110
use open-source principles and

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,700
technologies to make our military safer

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,440
and make America safer these goals

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,769
hopefully are clear they follow directly

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,299
from our mission statement but we're

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,190
trying to create new open source and

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,790
create new opportunities for open source

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,890
within DoD step out so I can actually

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,390
see it we're going to increase code

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,410
reuse so that we're not reinventing the

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,150
wheel every time that we need a

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,829
particular capability and increase

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,260
awareness of open source code that's

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,850
reusable to make it less likely that we

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,620
reinvent the wheel over and over and

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,200
over again and then we want to create

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,940
new events and opportunities to enable

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,680
that kind of collaboration and one of

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,090
those is our mailing list which I

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,799
encourage you all to get on that's where

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,540
the real magic of mill assess happens

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,090
it's just a bunch of guys talking about

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,530
open source and military and how we can

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,470
make chocolate and peanut butter two

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,060
great tastes taste great together and

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,220
then another big way that we do that is

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,910
our annual working group which I'll tell

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,910
you about a little bit later

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,680
the last step improve collaboration with

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,650
our allies actually became much more a

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,160
forefront of what we're doing this year

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:38,620
when the first non-us millis s group was

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,870
started a group and Israel copied our

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,820
model and sort of established themselves

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:48,010
as a chapter of this same style of

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:50,230
thinking so now we're starting to get a

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,310
little bit preachy and i'm sorry but i

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,590
am going to preach at you guys a little

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,650
bit these are sort of the the big

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,900
beliefs of mallu SS we find that

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,669
contributing to SS is a patriotic thing

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,040
that we can do to help make America

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,419
safer and that when we are trusted with

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,070
taxpayer dollars we have to make

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,919
absolutely the best use of that that we

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,600
possibly can so that we the people don't

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,919
get ripped off and so that we can

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,350
stretch those dollars as far as we can

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,760
and get the best bang for the buck and

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,889
we believe that the only thing more

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,990
innovative than people is lots of people

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:22,630
working together and that's what we do

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,729
and then we believe that problems need

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,050
solving and that a real problem that

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:32,410
solve right we'll find the funding that

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:34,419
it needs to find so military and open

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,640
source open source is a really new

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,800
concept and introducing it the military

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,810
it takes a little bit of time to change

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,000
anytime you have a large organization

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,240
especially an odor organization there's

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,130
a lot of inertia of resistance to change

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,440
the US military employees upwards of 3

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,630
million people and we've had a military

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,160
longer than we've had a constitution so

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,940
it very obviously meets the definition

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,979
of both old and large so it takes a

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,289
little while to get them up to speed one

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,400
nice thing though is the military has

00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,590
been around long enough to understand

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,510
some problems really really well so in

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,370
computer science we have a problem we

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,870
don't know how to solve we reduce it to

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,250
a problem we do know how to solve or

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,190
collection of problems we do know how to

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,340
solve so what problem is the military

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,039
really great at solving it's going to be

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,470
guns because it's America and that's we

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,080
do really really well so we talk about

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,720
what software can learn from guns and

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,820
what developers can learn from guns to

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,150
make their software better and work

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,110
better in the military application so

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,129
the first question is why should

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,889
software follow guns

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:42,849
so the military has been using guns

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,469
since a year that starts with 17 and

00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,939
they've been buying software at least

00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:49,189
something we would recognize as modern

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,499
computer software only since the 40s or

00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:54,610
50s and open source is a really new

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:57,139
concept by comparison to either of those

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,489
the other reason is that the military

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,800
has found a solution that works really

00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:03,110
well for their guns and that solution is

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,580
open source the vast majority of

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,069
individual weapons issued by the US

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,110
military are open source either because

00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,569
the patents have expired long ago or

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,610
because the military is the owner of the

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:16,279
specification so I'm talking about guns

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:20,629
being open source I'm talking about m16s

00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:22,279
m4s m9s 1911 s and M 11s and really

00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:25,129
other things that I haven't thought to

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,929
include on the notes as well some of

00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:29,300
those because their patents have expired

00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:31,369
the m4 because the government recently

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,729
acquired this specification and then the

00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:36,079
patents expired after that guns also

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,539
have some advantages just by their

00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,739
nature of being physical items that make

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:42,349
them a little bit easier to think of an

00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:44,059
open source terms and software so if I

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:45,649
have a gun it's not that hard for me to

00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:48,139
take it apart look at it find out how it

00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:49,939
works understand it identify a part that

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,389
I think is a problem build a better part

00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,559
for it and then distribute that part and

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,479
the manufacturers really don't have much

00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,219
of a problem with that but when you do

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,459
the same thing with software the

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,050
manufacturers lose their minds because

00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:05,209
they're forever trying to find ways to

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,889
say oh no you can't decompile this you

00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,289
can't modify it you can't see the code

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,369
and by no means can you redistribute

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,509
even you know an add-on for the code I

00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:16,189
mean there's an obvious difference in

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:18,439
that with guns if i distribute a gun to

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,119
you I don't have it anymore because it's

00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,439
a physical item so you can either have

00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:23,329
part and I can have part or one of us

00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,649
has the whole thing but it's not

00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,599
something like software where if I give

00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,699
you a copy i still have a copy but

00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,709
really that difference doesn't explain

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:34,939
quite enough of the complete mindset

00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:36,769
mindset shift between the two so to jump

00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:39,259
gears a little bit these are for

00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,519
benefits of open source and we'll talk

00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,300
about each of them and how we can learn

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,399
from guns in how we use them originally

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,809
when I made this slide I made a joke

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,089
that I either found these as a surveys

00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,870
results or made them up myself at the

00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,490
time I remember

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,930
which but now I really am going to have

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,330
to leave that as an exercise for the

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,550
reader but they should be things we're

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,470
all familiar with of working with open

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,220
source and i'll talk about them one at a

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,380
time starting with security so a lot of

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,020
people like to talk about open source

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,490
for security reasons and probably most

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,950
of us could give an entire hour long

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,570
talk just about the security benefits of

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,890
open source it's been beaten to death

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,680
and a lot of people love to talk about

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,960
it there's also a slowly prevailing

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,279
opinion including in government that

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,110
open source is the right way to do

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,120
security or the only way to do security

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,860
because how can you trust something you

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,800
don't understand and how can you

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,010
understand code you can't see and I

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,630
agree with that absolutely and that's

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,910
why I like mist understands that really

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,230
well that's why when Miss describes a

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,390
new specification for a cryptographic

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,339
algorithm it's always done in public

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,930
it's always done as part of a public

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,240
process where people can comment on it

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,770
and show their own version of it and how

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,990
there might be a problem with this or

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,060
something might be right with it it's

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,300
also why you don't ever see proprietary

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,550
cryptographic algorithms people on

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,230
computers or phones through a Google on

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,820
proprietary cryptographic algorithm and

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,040
look at how many hits you have to go

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,650
through before you find somebody saying

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,200
something good about one I tried it

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,640
yesterday and it took two pages worth of

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,860
hits before I found somebody saying

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,110
something that wasn't negative about the

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,220
idea of using proprietary crypto and the

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,800
thing that they were saying that wasn't

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,600
negative was that rc4 is proprietary

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,180
which isn't really a value statement

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,220
more just objective fact another

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,170
objective fact is that our c4 is cracked

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,420
and is the reason that your neighbors

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,130
wet protected Wi-Fi is why you can't

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,890
keep your kids from getting around you

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:39,500
for parental controls because it's just

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,029
a wide-open door next door so I'll say

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,800
like I do think that open source is

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,380
definitely the right way to do software

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,300
and the right way to do security but all

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,060
that said if you're considering an open

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,190
source solution it's important that it

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,290
be secure and that's open source does

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,660
not guarantee security and if you're

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,520
considering an insecure option even if

00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,990
it's because it's open source then

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,880
you're wrong and you're part of the

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,370
problem so unplug and go home we don't

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,730
need you because if the software is not

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,139
sick

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,639
here you can't be trusted and certainly

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:09,230
not in production environment especially

00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,459
not when dollars are on the line and

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,170
especially not when lives are on the

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:19,339
line I have sort of similar thoughts

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:21,430
about cost so we'd love to say open

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,910
source greatly improves your tea co and

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,589
it generally does and almost always but

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,760
at the same time that doesn't mean that

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,199
you should go with the solution just

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,370
because it's cheaper or just because

00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:36,230
it's open source so if Colt wants to

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,110
sell me that thing which looks really

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,240
useful and some guy on sourceforge with

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,889
a self-deprecating username wants to

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,470
sell me an axe and a greatly reduced

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:47,089
price I really have to consider which

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,310
one fits my mission objectives better

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,459
because if I'm cutting down trees I know

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:55,370
which one I want but if its combat it's

00:11:52,459 --> 00:12:04,220
not going to be the same one is it the

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:09,639
same one for you I've seen it done with

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,639
a shotgun right

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,630
so the other thing is I think we can

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,280
also imagine the opposite use case we

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,320
can all imagine situation we're in the

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,720
right hands that ax works better in

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,310
combat than that rifle so I like I'm

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,100
picturing maybe Jackie Chan and like a

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,360
super enclosed room where nobody can

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,390
really get the distance to shoot and he

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,070
can just way along and with open source

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,290
a lot of times open source nerds

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,600
including developers we like to think of

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,550
ourselves in that ninja roll where we're

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,570
like yeah absolutely this software works

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,130
a lot better my example i love

00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,900
thunderbird it's my favorite email

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,100
client but when i show it to somebody in

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,870
the next office over and say hey yeah

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,760
check this out this is great and they're

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,410
like oh that looks like it's not as

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,510
pretty or as full-featured as outlook

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,580
and I'm like well no I mean not out of

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,230
the box but when you got these six

00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,940
add-ons that i'm using and this custom

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,880
theme and all this like customizations

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,140
that I've done it works way better but

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,170
then I'm thinking like the guy that can

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,180
use the ax successfully instead of the

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,980
guy that needs the gun and the training

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,710
with the gun so we have to think in

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,790
terms of our end users not in terms of

00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:33,100
ourselves or of a perfect use case so if

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,870
the military wants to acquire a whole

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,820
ton of those rife of those axes and send

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,020
them into combat it may be cheaper up

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,430
front but then they're going to spend a

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,800
bunch of money turning them into rifles

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,870
first and I bet the process to turn on

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,300
ax into a rifle is more expensive than

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,800
the process to buy a rifle although I

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,730
can also think of use cases where

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:54,310
wouldn't be but that's not the point but

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,070
all that said open source generally does

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,930
improve your tea Co but TCO is the

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,000
target that you're trying to reduce not

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,040
the upfront cost what does it cost to

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,320
use successfully to complete your

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,400
missions with the finances that you have

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,020
available ease of customization is

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,210
probably my favorite feature of open

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,250
source personally certainly has

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,140
benefited me a lot where I need a

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,240
capability and either I can't afford to

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,310
go by that capability or I can't buy it

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,740
because nobody's done it yet but what I

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,170
can find is an open source project that

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,270
gets me really close I can acquire that

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,860
code add the capability to it and now I

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,899
have the capability for very little

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,750
costs and very little effort and that

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,010
works great when you're an R&D but if

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,170
you're in production you're not going to

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,910
buy 600,000 fixer-uppers and send them

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,230
into combat because it'd be the axe

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:52,180
thing again and that's how people get

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:54,250
hurt well so vendor Hawkin is something

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,440
I love to harp on because there's really

00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,910
no downside to getting rid of vendor

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,230
lock-in vendor lock-in is bad because

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,730
once you're locked in it's really hard

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,070
to get out and it's really hard to get

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,620
out cheaply but it's also a security

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,440
problem because if you're locked in to a

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,950
proprietary solution and then the vendor

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,570
quits you know files chapter 7 quits

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,430
making that product whatever and you

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,980
can't get rid of that product who's

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,380
making the security patches for you if

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,750
you don't have the code it's not you and

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,149
if the vendor is not doing it it's not

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,700
anybody and so now you have a vulnerable

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:33,550
thing on your network getting you into

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,990
trouble so the military has this problem

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,329
and they have this problem with guns as

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:41,920
well and the solution they found with

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:43,899
guns is that anybody can make the rifles

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,850
they're sending into combat so I said

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:47,769
earlier that like the m16 is an open

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,779
source gun anybody can make it and

00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:52,180
anybody can make parts for it anybody

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:55,000
can bid on contracts to make it or parts

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,040
or support for the government those five

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,459
companies have all made m16s and

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,620
successfully sold them to DoD one of

00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:06,010
them sticks out to me as somebody who's

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:09,310
not primarily known for making firearms

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,690
and I won't tell you which one I will

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,690
tell you which one its general motors

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,550
yeah there's a few missing on here also

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,079
I was looking for a list of people who

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,940
sold to DoD not to all branches of

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,529
government so if you if you expand that

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,820
to all like federal law enforcement as

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,550
well the list gets really big really

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,810
quickly and also I think I've missed

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,190
some that have happened since i made

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,300
this slide the slides about a year old

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,260
and i think somebody else started

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,120
selling him 16s to DoD last year you'll

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,370
see a similar thing to this to enforce

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,959
enforce were so sourced for a while so

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,160
the list won't be quite as expansive and

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,930
the m4 is considerably newer

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,610
also there was some patent and trademark

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,190
issues with the m4 for a while that

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,680
resulted in a lot of companies making in

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,329
fours they don't call em force or making

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,910
almost annum for but missing a couple of

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:57,800
parts but since now the specification is

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,240
open and the patents are expired and the

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,629
trademark has returned to the public

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,379
domain you'll have that problem anymore

00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,000
and you have lots of people making

00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,829
enforce and then since the sole source

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,120
contract ended you have lots people with

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,110
incentives to make them for is if

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,179
they're trying to sell them with DoD

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,579
other branch to federal law enforcement

00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:16,010
again weren't really hamstrung by that

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,600
sole source contract so you see m4 is

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:22,280
being sold by other companies to other

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,380
federal groups besides DoD so the issue

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,610
of lock-in is important but it means you

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,179
can't get the level of help you need

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:32,000
when you need it the military when they

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,500
procure guns they get people trained

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,539
them up on how to use them and deploy

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,039
them so that when something breaks you

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,900
don't have to have Colt fly somebody out

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,990
to fix it for you because that's not

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,220
going to happen so instead you have to

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,740
have somebody that's already trying to

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,659
tear it apart find the bug fix the bug

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:52,100
put it back together and get it back in

00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:53,750
combat what does that sound like so I

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,400
also find up saying that there's no tech

00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:01,669
support in a gunfight just like there's

00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:03,770
no crying in baseball so also sometimes

00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:04,909
you get vendors that suck and my

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,490
favorite example of that is ink

00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,200
cartridges because they use this sort of

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,630
we're going to give them the razor and

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,350
charge them extra for the blades sort of

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:18,620
mentality that is not fun to be on the

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,770
receiving end of so can you imagine if

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,260
Cole tried that same gimmick with an

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,870
ar-15 and said you know here's a really

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,429
cheap gun really expensive consumable

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,010
parts that you need to constantly be

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,780
buying more of every year that's not

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,250
going to work really well and so do D

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,340
found an open-source way of getting

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,940
around that and they're using a NATO

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,530
designed magazine that is standard and

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,270
when I say standard I mean it's

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,240
completely standardized will fit any

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,520
NATO issued 556 rifle and I'm not

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,110
talking talking about just us issued if

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,080
you find yourselves in a foxhole with

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,700
your NATO friend over here his mags fit

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,750
your gun even if he doesn't have the

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,890
same kind of gun

00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,240
even if he doesn't speak the same

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,700
language even if he doesn't work for the

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,810
same people if he's on the same side he

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,570
needs to be able to use the same

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:10,280
consumables and that's why we need open

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,960
source for saving lives I will say some

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,280
later issued rifles do require an

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,910
adapter take the standard magazine

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,700
although those are readily available so

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,040
you also have some fire manufacturers

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,620
that still try the ink cartridge thing

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,240
not quite as egregiously the more

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,580
expensive magazine that's up here on the

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,650
right is made by sig and they were

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,840
really proud of it at the time they were

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,430
fifty dollars per out of it and there's

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,230
nothing wrong with it it's just a little

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:41,390
spendy so open source comes and solved

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,880
that problem for us that patent is long

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,740
expired so a third party company comes

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,870
along it makes a better magazine and

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,780
it's equally reliable it takes three

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,090
extra rounds and it costs less than half

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,740
as much so you would think that that

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,360
would really offend that original

00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,690
manufacturer and they try to shut that

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,040
down it doesn't they like it a lot they

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,890
liked it so much they sell it as a

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,860
factory part now so that's sort of the

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:12,980
magic of open source and guns sort of as

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:14,600
a vendor lock-in round up being able to

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,670
use open source means that you can get

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,590
out from under your vendors thumb at

00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,850
least a little bit you don't have to use

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,200
the same vendor for maintenance and

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,850
support that you bought the code from

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,230
and you can find a vendor for

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,480
maintenance and support for code you

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,150
didn't buy you may have downloaded your

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,740
code from the Apache web site but

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,870
there's still a vendor out there that's

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,820
right there to help you with that you

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,060
also have to give up on a solution just

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,650
because the manufacturer gave up on it

00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,860
so for instance if you took one of those

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,650
General Motors assault rifles which by

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,750
the way are still around and try to take

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,950
it back to General Motors and said hey

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,180
man is broke I need some tech support

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,440
they would probably laugh at you and

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,610
then call security because there was a

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,630
guy with the gun walking around in the

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:03,500
lobby and well it is broken right well

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,750
if they don't know that but we're not

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,100
dependent on GM to fix that right

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,270
because there's all those other

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,650
companies that are happy to make parts

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,440
for it and there's way more companies

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,539
that make parts for

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,720
what I showed you that just haven't sold

00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:17,970
a complete rifle to do Dee do Dee having

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,649
been around for more than 200 years has

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,450
to be aware of the fact that when they

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:24,659
buy something they're going to last

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,940
longer than the vendor does the average

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,730
age of an m16 that's still in service

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,399
and DOD is 26 years which means half of

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,690
them are older than that so trusting

00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,909
that your vendor is still going to be

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,190
around for the next 26 years it's kind

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,899
of a hard call but trusting is you can

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,110
get support from it for it for somebody

00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:47,700
else is an easy choice and makes it open

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:50,149
source a lot more attractive sort of a

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,799
hot wash for this part of the slide deck

00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:55,019
open source with software just like open

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,789
source with guns is about keeping you in

00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,470
the fight it's about keeping you from

00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:02,580
getting locked in and it's about keeping

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:07,019
you from getting screwed so shifting

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:11,250
gears a little bit to policy I had to

00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:13,279
add this slide I wasn't expecting to get

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,990
asked quite as often as I did hey a

00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:20,250
military open source that's an oxymoron

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,889
right and the answer is no it's not I

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,490
even put it on the slide but 15 years

00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:28,799
ago that probably was an oxymoron and so

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,019
talking about how we get from yeah

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,820
there's no way we can't do open source

00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,529
and military to where we are now where

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,559
it's a fairly good environment for open

00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:39,720
source took a lot of work and we'll talk

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,210
about the work that it took here for

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,590
this next a little bit so this slide is

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,840
sort of a timeline of some of the major

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,990
policy documents that have been part of

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,980
getting open source used within DoD and

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,259
i'll talk about them one at a time

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,840
before I get into that I want to comment

00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,460
the two on the top left I actually top

00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,200
right because you guys are facing

00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,669
towards it I always try to get my left

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,950
and right mixed up at least once and

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,909
every talk I do so now I've checked that

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,799
box and I have to worry about that

00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:07,590
anymore but the two on the top right

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,139
were written with authors that are

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,610
included in our steering committee so

00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,840
mellow assess steering committee members

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,970
are listed in the author of those two

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,710
documents they are the open technology

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,929
development roadmap and then an update

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,240
to it the most recent update came out

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,700
last year those documents if you've ever

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,390
read Carl Fogle's producing open source

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,330
software

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:30,090
it's sort of a DoD focused update to

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,670
that vogels work is quoted heavily in it

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,770
if you haven't read Vogel's producing

00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,020
OSS you need to be reading it because

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,850
it's fantastic is an important document

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,100
that really shows how to avoid the

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,750
pitfalls of working in open source and

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,910
I'm producing an open source software

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:50,630
project we're converting a proprietary

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,630
software to open source what's up fo GTL

00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:00,930
so the first document on that list is

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,030
the miter business case paper and it

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,520
sometimes gets overlooked when talking

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,720
about OSS and DOD because there was

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,700
another paper that came out of mitre

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,910
shortly thereafter which is a much

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,990
bigger more important landmark paper but

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,190
this one was one of the things that

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,340
started to get started to help get the

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,110
ball rolling in 2001 mitre released a

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,990
document talking about the business case

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:26,150
for using open source including it DOD

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:28,860
and it gave us this nice little quote

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,420
OSS is a viable long-term solution that

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,620
merits careful consideration because of

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,210
the potential for significant cost

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,340
reliability and support advantages

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,500
that's awesome and we love to see that

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,930
kind of thing in print and they gave us

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,110
five steps for determining when to start

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,240
considering OSS for Houston DoD the

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,610
first one was to look at the community

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,230
that's supporting it so you're looking

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,720
for big well established communities

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,420
that are growing so think like linux and

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,530
apache groups that aren't going anywhere

00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,180
the next thing is to look at the market

00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,150
share if there's a demand for that

00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,950
product even if the distributor or even

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,890
if the developer goes away the product

00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,450
won't go away because an open source we

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,160
don't like that let that happen if we're

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,600
all dependent on something and some guy

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,820
drops off the project somebody else

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,110
steps up so looking at the market share

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,100
can be as important as looking at the

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,230
size of the developer community the next

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,460
thing is look at the cost and benefit

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,410
analysis of using this particular

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,520
open-source project and that's something

00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,840
you should be doing any time you're

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,150
going procurement regardless of whether

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,490
it's software or guns or open source or

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,590
proprietary and then compare the

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:33,300
long-term costs because a lot of times

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,790
people get focused on the upfront costs

00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,290
and sometimes open source may be more

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,720
expensive because it requires sort of

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,090
transit

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,130
way from a locked in solution sometimes

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,200
it may be a lot cheaper because you're

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,460
getting software at no cost but

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,780
generally in the long term it starts

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,210
becoming cheaper because the support

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,260
contract may be a little cheaper and

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:53,710
then choose your strategy and stick to

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,710
it this is the paper that really

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,750
eclipses the first miter paper this is

00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,750
the miter survey it was part of Meyers

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,790
ongoing research into OSS at DoD and it

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,250
really this is important because this

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:09,610
put to bed this notion that open source

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:12,280
has no place at DoD a guy at murder made

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,710
miter asked by DoD by the name of Terry

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,770
Bollinger send an email to everybody

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,870
with a dot mil email address and said

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,330
hey what kind of open source you use

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,410
them and instead of getting the answer

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,480
that you would get if you ask this

00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,190
question now which is probably yeah we

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,290
don't comment on software for

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,760
operational security reasons people were

00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,580
happy to share with them what they were

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:38,710
using and he found 115 examples of open

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:40,780
source in 251 use cases just do d so the

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,640
the examples are available publicly the

00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,470
use cases when it gets specific are

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,610
distributed as a separate document that

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,650
wasn't released to the general public

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,870
for security concerns but this is a

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:54,040
great paper check it out but think about

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:58,390
that 115 examples of open source in 251

00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,510
use cases in 2001 what open source

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,130
projects were you using in 2001 I know

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,110
it wasn't Firefox because it was still

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,850
called Phoenix it hadn't even become

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:09,700
Firebird yet and it was still 3 years

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,490
away from a 1 point 0 release so hearing

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,050
at that time that not only was DoD using

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,730
open source but that it was using it in

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,950
mission-critical applications and was

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,690
dependent on it was a big wake-up call

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,040
to DoD because then all of a sudden it

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,900
wasn't we need to stop using open source

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,300
it was we need to find out what's right

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,590
about open source that's resulting in us

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:31,620
using it even more not sure we're on

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,620
board with it please

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,830
so I actually I got to do an update of

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,850
that sort I couldn't do a direct survey

00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,530
because people don't want to talk about

00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,840
it but I was able to look at what was

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,030
publicly documented and found that a

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,550
large percentage of the software that he

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,720
identified is still in use a big part of

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,010
that is because he wasn't talking about

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,010
distributions he was talking about

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:12,050
individual tools so something like bind

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,780
is not going anywhere because we still

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:18,410
need DNS really badly you know something

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,780
like Apaches not going anywhere it also

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,820
only called out like Linux and then bsd

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,350
first and then distributions rather than

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,120
focusing on individual things that go

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,120
away more easily what's up

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:51,169
so that's usually and i'll get to that i

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,820
will i will that those are usually

00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:54,679
referred to as government off-the-shelf

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,419
software and the source code may be

00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,779
available internally but not externally

00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:01,339
but i have information about that the

00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,700
other thing is an update of sorts was

00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:06,950
done by DHS as part of the homeland open

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,210
security technology program it was

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,940
focused on federal government as a whole

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,009
not on just do d so that may be

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,389
something worth checking out as far as

00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:16,609
what's an updated snapshot looking like

00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:18,200
but you can also get the list and just

00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:21,249
tell from looking at it oh yeah this is

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,249
all still relevant software

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,560
this is not this is not military created

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,320
software this is open source software

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:45,230
the military procured and was using that

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:47,240
they got from somebody else I'll made

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,720
everybody uses bind right I get on the

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,720
internet sometimes

00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,950
the other thing it's not only as bind

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,690
being used but bind is being used in a

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,830
critical way because if you take bind

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:36,310
away then you have a real hard time

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:38,350
what's up I bet O'Reilly has that

00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,050
information and I bet they don't want to

00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:48,400
share it because then that's a hunting

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:50,170
list for everybody else so talking about

00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,760
policy changes that sort of followed as

00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,800
a direct direct result of the meijer

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,630
study the minor study opens everybody's

00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,190
eyes and then policy starts shifting as

00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,870
a result of it and minor study really

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,360
sets the course of policy changes to

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,890
come and the first big policy change is

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,350
what we called aston bit nemo named

00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,910
after johnston the former DoD CIO and

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,840
former assistant secretary of defense

00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:13,870
and in it he says that open source

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,540
software meets the dip the DoD's

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,160
definition of commercial software which

00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,720
is critical because until that point

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,390
people had this perception that open

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,610
source mitten on commercial and the DoD

00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,100
has procurement guidelines for getting

00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,920
commercial off-the-shelf software and no

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,080
procurement guidelines for getting non

00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,090
commercial software and discourages

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,560
getting non commercial software but the

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,540
DoD's definition of what commercial

00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,180
means is that it has been sold or

00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:43,240
licensed or been offered for sale or

00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,800
licensed to the public at some point so

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,950
it's really hard to find an open source

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,950
project it doesn't meet that definition

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,950
but

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:35,100
was it not licensed ok I think they spun

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,100
out a company actually

00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,250
it's unfair and

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,149
if I can make a quick vote I'd like to

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,210
continue that discussion with beer later

00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:34,200
but for right now let's uh can I get

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,820
back but yeah so this idea that all that

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,770
open source software was commercial

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,899
software is what sort of kicked in the

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,380
door and open source start seeing use

00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:46,110
within DoD also going back per second

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,480
stem it memo in 2003 as far as i can

00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,029
tell was the first government document

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,130
to talk about the use of open source in

00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,390
the procurement policy every couple of

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,000
years somebody thinks that they've

00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:58,830
created this new open-source thing like

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,450
in 2010 the city of san francisco

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,760
announced how it had the first

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,649
government policy about open source but

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,179
they were a few years late for that they

00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:10,770
just you know didn't get to the library

00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:13,440
oft enough so the Office of Management

00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,240
and Budget I issue a memo in 2004 titled

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,310
software acquisition that sort of did

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,659
the same thing for the federal

00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,240
government as a whole rather than just

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,919
for within DoD and made this same

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,210
statement about open source being

00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,560
commercial software and following the

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:30,030
same rules the don cio guidance

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,339
department of navy chief information

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,399
officer was titled department of the

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:38,429
navy open source guidance and is another

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,740
big landmark piece on open source within

00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,119
DoD and i'm actually going to read for

00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,010
it for just a second because i think

00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,649
some of this is awesome but a big quote

00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,179
was the misconception the OSS is neither

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:50,310
a commercial off-the-shelf where

00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,320
government off-the-shelf solution has

00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,869
hindered do ends ability to leverage the

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,639
benefits of OSS methodology because of

00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:58,349
this misconception OSS has not received

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,930
equal consideration during the software

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:02,880
acquisition process and then it goes on

00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,369
to say that when procuring open-source

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,810
software you need to make sure that you

00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,460
abide by the terms of its license

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,170
agreement which is cool for another

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,030
reason because it was one of the first

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,130
documents to give legs to the GPL and

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:17,280
say hey look the government's following

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:20,330
this to you know in fact about the

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,330
enforceability of the GPL

00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,490
yeah that wasn't the thing that opened

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,410
the door to the use of Navy what we did

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,480
open source within the Navy it was the

00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,950
thing that changed the policy and made

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,240
it easy for in the future for people to

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:48,320
continue using open source within the

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:48,320
Navy right right

00:35:56,819 --> 00:36:02,619
when you need saucony to understand from

00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,240
the context that even though OSS was

00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:06,190
being used within certain parts of the

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,099
Navy or within certain parts of the DoD

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,269
it's a huge organization and not

00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,910
everybody knows what everybody else is

00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:14,470
doing and a top-down memo ensures that

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,660
all of a sudden people are up to date on

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:18,309
what the policy means because the policy

00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,279
never prohibited the use of open source

00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:24,519
right it had a misconception that it did

00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:26,589
and these update the misconception and

00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,420
say hey guys you should be using this

00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:32,769
there's really good reasons to be doing

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,539
so the most recent in terms of DoD sort

00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:37,059
of memo on this topic is the wintergreen

00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:40,390
memo which supersedes and replaces the

00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:42,760
2003's Timbit memo I would talk about it

00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,740
for a couple of slides actually but the

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,269
first thing it said is open source is

00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,609
cots commercial off-the-shelf it's that

00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:50,349
same statement that we keep seeing over

00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:54,609
and over again that becomes really

00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:56,529
important in the procurement process the

00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:57,940
next thing it said was that open source

00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:59,380
needs to be included in the market

00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,259
research that's done when you're

00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,849
procuring software DoD is required to do

00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:05,859
market research when procuring software

00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,960
and now they're required to include open

00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:09,490
source as part of that process to

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,529
identify when they could be using open

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:16,509
source it also and this is great because

00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:17,950
always good to have good press always

00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:21,490
good to have good press written by the

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:24,759
DoD CIO was a list of benefits of open

00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,200
source according to DoD the first thing

00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,089
was that the source code peer review

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,470
like when you have the code out in the

00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:31,750
public and people can argue about it

00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,710
endlessly you get a pretty good feel for

00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,569
whether it's going to be secure and

00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,950
reliable because people are running it

00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:38,500
and they're finding problems with it and

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,789
they're fixing the problems the next

00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,289
thing is that when the DoD gets the

00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:43,420
ability to change its own software if

00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:44,950
the mission changes the software can

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,809
change with it whereas if they're locked

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:49,180
in the software they can't modify they

00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,710
don't have that option they also get

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,470
that reduced vendor lock-in that I love

00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,119
to talk about because open-source

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,769
licenses don't really restrict who can

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,660
use the code how they can use the code

00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:00,039
where they can use the code when you

00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,289
need a project you can get open source

00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:04,180
really really quickly I know personally

00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,200
I've used an open source solution for

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,819
something that I could have used a

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,029
proprietary solution for just because I

00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:11,159
didn't have to wait until I could buy

00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:13,439
the proprietary solution not even a

00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:17,519
budget concern a timing concern I can

00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:19,409
make open source happen right now the

00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,880
lack of pursuit licensing and some open

00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:23,459
source projects do have per state

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,659
licensing but generally it doesn't and

00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:27,779
if it does it's not quite as expensive

00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:29,609
as using proprietary solution DoD is

00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:31,799
able to share the maintenance costs and

00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:33,059
they can either share it among DoD you

00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,829
can have a lot of groups within DoD

00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:36,449
using the same software and all

00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,579
benefiting from maintenance that they're

00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:40,109
doing with each other or within the

00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,819
federal government other groups when the

00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,529
government can be using it or with

00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:46,229
commercial users or with the community

00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:48,059
and then rapid prototyping so if you

00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:49,890
need a solution right now you don't know

00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,319
exactly what it looks like but you can

00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,999
use open source to find out because this

00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:55,199
open source let's just download it off

00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:58,019
the web and run it is kind of the

00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:01,589
ultimate free trial because it doesn't

00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:04,999
expire and then you can modify it to fit

00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:07,019
what you need the prototype to look like

00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:10,229
here were some of the guidance that was

00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:11,609
attached to that the first is that you

00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:14,279
have to use the software that best fits

00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:15,779
the need regardless of its license which

00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:17,369
in my opinion is a big win for open

00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:18,749
source because open source wasn't seeing

00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,609
quite as much used within DoD as it's

00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:22,289
been seeing since then because now the

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:25,739
license isn't as relevant as what fits

00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:27,359
the mission the best also and this is

00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,969
cool the prohibitions against using code

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,219
without much support options we're found

00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:33,539
did not apply to open source because

00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:35,400
just because there's not a support

00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,469
option available for it doesn't mean it

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,999
can't be supported you can procure open

00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:41,069
source and then support it yourself

00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:42,329
because you have access to that code so

00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:44,069
you can have someone get trained on the

00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:45,359
software learn how to use it learn how

00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:46,949
to do it's their own tech support and

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,459
learn how to make their own updates bug

00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:51,959
fixes enhancements modifications no

00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,849
software should be used without support

00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:55,259
which is someplace where open-source

00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,669
really shines because you don't have to

00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,919
use the same vendor for support that you

00:39:56,669 --> 00:40:00,059
bought the code from and you don't maybe

00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,769
have to use a vendor for open-source

00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:03,150
support at all you may be able to be the

00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:06,209
support yourself as was previously

00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,369
mentioned and that using open source

00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:10,559
doesn't trap the government there was a

00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:13,919
lot of fear once upon a time about the

00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,989
GPL that maybe if you use code that's

00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:18,509
GPL you're going to be forced to give

00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:20,429
back anything you do to it well no the

00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:21,809
GPL doesn't say that what it says is

00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,520
that if you distribute the software you

00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:24,320
have to also just

00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,360
beat the code but if I download

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,310
something and I say oh I really need

00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,990
this fix real quick and I do it nobody

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,810
has a gun to my head and says now you

00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,600
must commit that backup on sourceforge

00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:36,620
because that's not how the license works

00:40:34,600 --> 00:41:08,270
and the open source should be shared

00:40:36,620 --> 00:41:09,910
sorry glad cool well that's I mean

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,740
that's awesome problems need solutions

00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:15,080
and then the last big win was that open

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,120
source needs to be shared so if the DoD

00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,740
is procuring open source as big of an

00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,210
organization as DoD is it's a good

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,460
chance somebody else in DoD needs the

00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,980
same software so start sharing that as

00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,960
widely as possible and that actually

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,760
fits in with Forge mill which came out

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,470
around this time which is the DoD's

00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,350
means of sharing source code within

00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,220
itself both for things that they procure

00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,350
it and for things they've developed

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:41,570
themselves or for updates they've added

00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:42,980
to other projects now an awesome thing

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,620
that was included at the tail end of the

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:49,670
winter in memo was wind as DoD release

00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:51,260
open source software the 2009 memo

00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,690
encouraged DoD to start making

00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:56,270
open-source software releases under

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,740
certain circumstances and the first one

00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,360
sounds a little Machiavellian because

00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:03,350
it's when it's to the government's

00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,210
advantage however the example that they

00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,470
called out is that it is to the

00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,330
government's advantage to have as many

00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,400
users of their software as possible

00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,710
because more users mean that they're

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,140
finding bugs and filing bug fixes and

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,370
more users with the source code means

00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,770
that those bug fixes have patches

00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:22,340
attached to them which is greatly to do

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,390
DS advantage the next big requirement is

00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,580
that the government actually has the

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,620
right to distribute the code which

00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,000
almost always is the case because work

00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,740
produced for the government becomes the

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,270
government's property but occasionally

00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,860
there are some edge cases where

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,400
contractors are involved and they wind

00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,650
up with partial ownership of the code

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,750
and there's some attachments to talk

00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,579
about how to get around those situations

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,900
and still make releases and then the

00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,190
last step is that the release of the

00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,920
software can't be prohibited by law

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,869
which is kind of a no-brainer and they

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,849
talk about specifically with export

00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,869
controls where you might have something

00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:53,549
that's aight are controlled and you

00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,960
can't release outside the US so

00:42:53,549 --> 00:43:01,859
basically DoD has to follow the same

00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,450
rules as everybody else rootkits yeah

00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:08,220
I've never found one of those on github

00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:18,869
I mean at least not with their name on

00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:20,549
it so if this slide is something that I

00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:22,260
took from our website this is from our

00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:24,390
policy section I website has a lot of

00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,730
policy resources also a lot of licensing

00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,799
resources all of these on the website

00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,000
come with links so you can get links

00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:33,480
directly to these documents we're

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,760
talking about so that's sort of where we

00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,760
were here is where you are now and this

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,980
screengrab I took yesterday evening and

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,490
it gives me a warm fuzzy because it is

00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:48,119
on defense gov and it's not buried deep

00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:52,589
within defense gov it's DoD cio defense

00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:54,510
gov / open source software faq and this

00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:57,720
is the current guidance on using open

00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:59,849
source within the military so while that

00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,230
gives me a warm fuzzy not as much as the

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:06,660
last question in the FAQ which in case

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,160
you can't read it is where two OSS

00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,950
developers congregate and what

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,109
conferences should i go to admit assess

00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:19,700
is mentioned by name twice in there so

00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:21,930
that's awesome so when you start finding

00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,970
open source policy being discussed

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,970
you'll probably find people from the low

00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:29,309
assess involved our guys love policy

00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,960
they love talking about policy and they

00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:33,930
love being involved in policy especially

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,190
open source policy most of the documents

00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,900
we've talked about have had somebody

00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:41,369
from will assess involved in the process

00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,079
at least to some extent so if you come

00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:46,589
by the booth you've seen our stickers

00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,280
that say OSS is here note the present

00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:49,620
tense

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,560
with defense.gov talking about open

00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:55,020
source and a big faq like it's time for

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,850
open source to paraphrase victor hugo

00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,190
nothing is this powerful as an idea

00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:00,810
whose time has come and open source is

00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,150
here it's time is here and it's not

00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,830
going anywhere and you can tell this go

00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,470
to a linux users group meeting right

00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,880
like years ago when we went to lug

00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,100
meetings we talked about man i really

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,930
can't get this thing installed and I

00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,480
really can't figure out how to get sound

00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:19,260
support working with this laptop at all

00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,360
ever now if you go to a lug meeting the

00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,680
lugs either gone because nobody needs

00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,380
support anymore they can pick up the

00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,030
phone and get support or if the lugs

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,680
still around they're talking about cool

00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,750
stuff beyond just here's how you get

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,060
software on your computer because

00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,430
they've had to change because we are

00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,430
here open sources here Linux is here

00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,270
it's not going anywhere so getting it on

00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,810
your computer is not an interesting

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:46,530
topic anymore I mean so my parents are

00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:48,660
not computer people and they couldn't

00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:50,520
tell you what an Apache server is but

00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:54,690
they have an opinion about xfce versus

00:45:50,520 --> 00:46:00,330
gnome 3 so that for me is the benchmark

00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:01,530
from when open source is here so

00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,000
hopefully I've gotten at least some of

00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:04,590
you guys marginally interested in what

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,690
we're doing and you're wondering how you

00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:09,810
can participate so the last couple of

00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:11,700
minutes here talk about that the first

00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,860
thing is that membership is open to

00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,630
everybody we don't have any kind of

00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,760
checks there's no nationality

00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,950
requirement it doesn't matter where

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,160
you're from what country you live in hop

00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,660
on our mailing list there's no fee we

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,610
are an organization where you're as

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,310
involved as you want to be so if all you

00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,050
want to do is get a weekly digest of our

00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,090
emails is a way of checking out hey

00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,150
there's something cool that's changed in

00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,590
OSS with DoD that's cool if you want to

00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:40,050
get really involved in the conversation

00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:42,090
that's really cool to maybe you're more

00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:44,970
into the meat space kind of meetups in

00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:47,490
different regions we have weekly monthly

00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:50,010
drinks lunch dinner or whatever where we

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,750
talk about these types of things if we

00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,370
don't have something in your region feel

00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,890
free to start one nobody standing in

00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:58,350
your way we try to follow a very open

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,600
source principle that we leave by doing

00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,970
so if you want to get involved don't ask

00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,140
for

00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,420
but don't wait for somebody to ask you

00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:08,770
for help just get up and do something

00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:11,220
awesome along that vein we've started a

00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:13,420
chapters initiative within mellow assess

00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,670
we had our first chapter start up a

00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,970
couple years ago and shot in a

00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:22,210
Charleston yes you know who doesn't have

00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:26,740
a chapter Charlotte you know who needs

00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:28,660
to start that chapter you do so what

00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:32,920
well we don't have a chapter in raleigh

00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:34,960
yet either so these are these chapters

00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,660
are sort of the first ones we got

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,300
started we have more coming out

00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:42,640
regularly and the chapters are just like

00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,590
an individual you're as involved as you

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,030
want to be so if your chapter wants to

00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,430
get together and have beer once a month

00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,070
that's a great chapter event and I want

00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,840
to go to that if your chapter wants to

00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:54,280
have a massive conference that's also a

00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,190
great chapter event and I want to go to

00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,570
that too so it's up to the chapter how

00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,310
involved they want to be what they want

00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,800
to do and what an event looks like for

00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:05,050
them I think our only requirement for

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,970
what a chapter does is they have at

00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:10,060
least two events of some description in

00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,260
their first two years of operation so I

00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,980
mean you can get a bunch of guys

00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:20,440
together with pizza at least twice

00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:22,960
probably pretty quickly so last i have

00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,300
my shameless plug we have an upcoming

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,460
event in charleston and i heard people

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:30,280
go woo a minute ago so i expect to see

00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,710
you all there it's our annual working

00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,820
group it's merging with a chapter event

00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,950
that was being held there last year

00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,200
we've decided to have our annual working

00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,030
group start floating around to our

00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,040
chapters so that we start seeing

00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,950
different faces every year at the event

00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,700
and start getting more exposure and

00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,530
focus on the great work that our

00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,599
chapters are doing so we're starting

00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,220
that with Charleston it's august six

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,330
through eight yeah it's so if you're

00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,940
looking for when that is it's right

00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:58,020
before flock and hopefully i'll see you

00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:01,000
all there here's my contact information

00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:05,200
if you want to ask questions i'm at my

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,760
booth I'll on the emails I have twitter

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,760
I rarely use it so I didn't include it

00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:15,140
I mean I'm happy to follow other people

00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,520
on Twitter but like logging in is

00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:22,880
something that seems like a lot of work

00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:24,410
for me so although if you have a plug-in

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:33,500
to use Twitter from within Thunderbird I

00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:42,740
want to know about it probably a lot

00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:46,430
because everybody uses acronyms well

00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,300
that's true and unpronounceable to the

00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,620
unpronounceable ones are the best

00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,620
because it's like Oh have you tried

00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,240
anyway so that's all I have thank you

00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,240
all for coming out

00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,870
you

00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:11,789
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,740
ago we could not have imagined that

00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:15,960
asterisk would not only become the most

00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,089
widely adopted open source communication

00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,130
software on the planet but that it would

00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:22,650
impact the entire industry in the way

00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:24,630
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,240
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:29,220
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,319
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,700
transition of power from the hands of

00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,980
the traditional proprietary phone

00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,380
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,299
administrators of phone systems using

00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,529
this power our customers have created

00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:42,480
all sorts of business changing

00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:44,339
applications from small office phone

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,859
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,450
the international carrier networks in

00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:50,250
fact there's even an entire country

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:52,619
those communications infrastructure runs

00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,750
on esters the gym has always been about

00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:56,460
creating technology that expands

00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:58,650
communications capabilities in ways that

00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,849
we could never have imagined and that's

00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,220
part of what's game-changing about

00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:04,920
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,019
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,150
IP phones that extends control of the

00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,890
user all the way to the desktop the

00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,599
launch of these new products represents

00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,579
the next phase indigenous history of

00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:17,099
innovation these are the first and only

00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:18,450
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:20,130
power of esther's when we first

00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,779
discussed our expectations for building

00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:24,390
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:26,160
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,930
asked the team to build the phones such

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,119
that they were easy to install integrate

00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,980
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,529
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,180
that goal user feedback is validating

00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:38,279
that when it comes to operation with

00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:40,710
astro space systems including our own

00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:43,289
Switchvox based product these are the

00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,579
easiest to use best integrated most

00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:47,190
interoperable products on the market

00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:49,160
today the digitally of phones will

00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:51,269
initially include three IP des hommes

00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,160
uniquely designed to complement any

00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:55,049
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,720
these phones are different for a number

00:51:55,049 --> 00:52:00,359
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,799
designed for use with asterisks secondly

00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:03,230
we've made it really easy to

00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:05,789
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,470
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,180
to access information inside of

00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,920
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,440
between the

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,329
application and the phone additionally

00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,609
we've created an applications engine

00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:18,799
that allows users and developers to

00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:21,410
create and run their own apps on the

00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:23,660
following and finally we've done all of

00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:25,369
this at a very compelling price point at

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,589
digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,930
give our customers the best value in

00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:31,220
business phone systems and also give

00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:33,319
them the power to create their own

00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,119
solutions or any communications

00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:36,799
challenge will continue to push the

00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,510
boundaries not only to make Astra's

00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:40,460
cooler bastard more technologically

00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:42,020
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,210
what communications even easier and

00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,680
together we'll change the way the world

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,680
communicates again

00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,270
your customers rely on your website or

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,640
application if it's slower

00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:04,609
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,410
and costs you money keeping your

00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:09,920
business critical systems humming along

00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:12,230
requires insight into what they're doing

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,180
your system metrics tells stories

00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,190
stories that can reveal performance

00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,530
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,089
other problems but how do you keep an

00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:22,760
eye on all of your systems performance

00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:25,760
metrics in real-time and record this

00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,530
data for later analysis enter longview

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,569
the new way to see what's really going

00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,700
on under the hood the long view

00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:33,770
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,230
of all your systems providing you with a

00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:39,619
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:42,170
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:43,940
load and network usage click a specific

00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:46,339
system to access its individual

00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:48,849
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:51,260
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:52,940
comprehensive network data including

00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,250
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,809
available on the network tab and disk

00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,730
rights and free space on the disk

00:53:56,809 --> 00:54:01,579
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:04,099
displays usage statistics for individual

00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:06,290
processes the system info tab shows

00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:08,510
listening services active connections

00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,670
and available updates adding long view

00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:12,349
to a system is easy just click the

00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:14,510
button copy the one line installation

00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:16,940
command then run the command on your

00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:18,650
linux system to complete the process the

00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,839
agent will begin collecting data and

00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:22,670
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:25,220
start rolling

00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:27,620
use longview to gain visibility into

00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:31,330
your servers so when your website or app

00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,330
heats up it stays up

00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:17,420
most enterprises today realize that

00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,070
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:21,440
enough to keep their network safe from

00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:23,510
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,550
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:27,680
popular lately that adds that extra

00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:30,350
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,120
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:34,310
know is that some two-factor

00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,530
authentication solutions they're better

00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:39,560
than others like two-factor strong

00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:41,840
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,790
beyond other authentication systems by

00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,880
being less expensive easier to implement

00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:49,340
and easier to use giving software-based

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,220
token clients built to run on all major

00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,790
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:57,140
Android these tokens utilize a

00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:59,540
public/private key combination that's

00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,490
generated on device so there aren't any

00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:04,010
shared secrets flying around for

00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:06,860
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:08,720
special handling instead all keys are

00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,210
kept secure and private between the

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,400
requesting token and your server which

00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,010
you control in-house making it the most

00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,690
secure way possible to perform

00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:20,480
authentication encryption and with an

00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:23,270
extensive flexible API and support for

00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,250
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,650
works with any enterprise network

two-factor authentication for the first

00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,540
time or just ready to ditch your

existing expensive key file system we

00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:47,880

use strong authentication from wicked

00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,970
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:01,130
way to better utilize all your resources

00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:04,610
and it makes managing all your resources

00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:08,440
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:11,960
happening in open source the

00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,760
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,860
of the community and the speed at which

00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,840
these are these you know these these

00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,760
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,490
discovered and then fixed is that I

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,340
think that really shows the power of the

00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:27,080
you know of the open source community it

00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:31,280
is global and it's definitely because of

00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:33,800
the users community people are extremely

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:38,900
friendly and they're almost ready to

00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:40,370
help if you go on tire see any day

00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:42,680
you'll see these guys helping each other

00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:45,080
out and they're all doing it like in a

00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,940
selfless manner the product is

00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:50,720
transparent for everyone everyone can

00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:53,180
look at the code base everyone can see

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,760
how both darkest is being built nothing

00:57:53,180 --> 00:58:00,890
nothing is proprietary everything is

00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:06,380
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:10,250
to the the ongoing health CloudStack the

00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:14,230
most exciting event in recent memory for

00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:16,930
he was our first developer boot camp

00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:19,570
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:23,530
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:27,700
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:30,550
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:33,100
chairs into the room twice everything

00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:36,340
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:39,400
is open source and so I don't think that

00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:41,140
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,200
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:46,750
computing and so i think it's i think

00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,250
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,359
about cloud computing you're really

00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:54,910
talking about open source cloud

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:57,970
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:00,100
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:04,359
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:07,030
in each data centers these hardware is

00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:10,540
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:13,240
to handle number one that mass scale

00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:16,420
number two it's designed to handle the

00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:19,270
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:23,470
deployments started working on cog deck

00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:26,740
over four years ago and it was the

00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:28,510
original set of people working on it had

00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:32,619
a background of delivering software

00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:36,850
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:40,480
lots of users actually using it high

00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:43,540
availability is the key feature multiple

00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,730
hypervisors support different network

00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:48,730
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:50,500
better while steck management server can

00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:54,190
be deployed in different physical

00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,869
machines it definitely has a huge

00:59:54,190 --> 01:00:00,850
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:59:55,869 --> 01:00:03,430
there's a major movie studio that they

01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:06,730
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:08,710
to transcode video and i thought that

01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:10,359
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:13,630
more fascinating is what they did during

01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:16,390
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:17,550
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,500
lunch was over they would just

01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:23,520
all the instances and go back to doing

01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:25,170
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,240
so many different aspects and there's no

01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:29,610
one person that's kind of like a master

01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,720
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:35,940
as a project is going to be one of the

01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:40,020
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:45,450
most feature fallen and and robust

01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:48,350
platforms out they were I don't senior

01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,350
