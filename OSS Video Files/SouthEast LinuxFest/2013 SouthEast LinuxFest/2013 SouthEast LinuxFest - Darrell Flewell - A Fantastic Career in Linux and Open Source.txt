	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,860

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,619
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,830
linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,400
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,309
possible I guess we'll start is anyone

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,559
really really tired or hungover right

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:42,480
now this is kind of it that's okay

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,989
there's cut both because there's this

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
there's this thing in the in the state

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:51,989
called 5-hour energy i hadn't

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,600
encountered this before and i just took

00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:00,000
some and it's really good and i actually

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,850
have some extra bottles if anyone would

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,909
would like one if I know it's probably

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,040
really bad for you right but but I

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,159
thought if I'm going to be the most

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,860
excited one in the room that I want at

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,990
least three other people as excited as I

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,360
am so we had wanted to hear no you I

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,080
don't think you're the most vocal

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,390
already so none for you and who's yet

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,430
got one more spread around a little bit

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,850
who's really really tired because yeah

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,960
we'll give star wars that deserves some

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,470
by itself so now got at least three

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,049
people try to keep the folks around you

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:50,520
awake you know with your energy that you

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,799
have I'm the chief financial officer for

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,270
linux professional Institute and I don't

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,729
get out much at all so we've got so much

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,850
going on it was decided that I would

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,460
come and do the presentation for

00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:09,270
southeast linux fest and we have you

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,220
know normally other other more technical

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,800
folks that come to these to these shows

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,590
but this presentation is

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,640
not a technical presentation thankfully

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,400
or I'd be dead it's it's a presentation

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,100
with a message about working and having

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,200
a career and getting paid in linux and

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,480
open source and that's okay you know

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,310
you're allowed to do that it's not it

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,690
doesn't it even the software's free

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,310
doesn't mean you have to work for free

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,900
okay there's really exciting interesting

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,080
lucrative careers in linux and open

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,690
source and the timing from what I've

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,550
seen and the people that I've talked to

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,350
and the other people at our organization

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,580
have talked to the timings never been

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,370
better so if you're here if this is your

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,740
first linux conference if you're already

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,600
working and maybe i should maybe i

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,620
should actually like to know that is

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,440
anyone working in open-source already

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,630
and feeding yourself from it you know

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,490
you have actually shelter that's a job

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:17,040
is paying and it's linux and open source

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:19,110
is anyone here doing that exclusively no

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,340
one that i see or because you don't they

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,690
admit it either but so maybe so so i'm

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,180
gonna i'm going to say then that most of

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,110
you are relatively new to linux and open

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,739
source or new to the career aspect of it

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,620
perhaps yes no no one wants to really

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,420
say so it doesn't the presentation will

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,670
work in either in either case either

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,209
you're brand new to linux you're even a

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,820
student you're just you've been dabbling

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:54,690
in it you've been working with it either

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:58,020
way that a question that's a good start

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,470
so maybe maybe you do that for free or

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,690
for fun but there's ways for work so

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,320
there's ways to do it for work and be

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,510
paid the idea here is if you're working

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,019
already there's things that you can do

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,750
to move farther ahead or advanced in

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,570
links on open source if you're new to it

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,600
there's tips here that should allow you

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,120
to better prepare for that first

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,770
interview and hopefully that first job

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,770
in linux and open source

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,880
we call it a LP I the coming wave of

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,770
open-source software and we really feel

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,380
that as I said the time has never been

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,490
better there's so much happening right

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,460
now and you know throw the terms around

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,220
with with big data and cloud technology

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,320
and all the linux and open source

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,970
software that's happening in that field

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,780
really are it's creating a lot of

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,120
momentum for us right now and this is

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,120
not meant to insult the intelligence of

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,250
anyone here at a linux conference what

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,460
is open source because it shouldn't

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,890
necessarily be new to most of you but at

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,990
the same time there's often people that

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,850
are coming in to these conferences and

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,540
this is and everything is very new so

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,850
we'll just go over quickly what it is

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,190
and I'll probably do a hatchet job on

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,230
the definition and you can correct me

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:31,340
afterwards because I know it gets thrown

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:34,280
allow thrown around a lot it's refers to

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,470
software that is released with the

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,560
source code available and is under a

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,810
license to ensure that those works are

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,960
available going forward and that the

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:47,630
source code is available and at the same

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,950
time it it's meant to protect the rights

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,810
of original authors and there's lots you

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,610
could do an entire presentation probably

00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:01,090
just on what open-source software is

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:05,590
this is what we call we call the pyramid

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:08,030
the tower and we show this because

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,670
people may not realize that the public

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,700
Internet is powered by linux and open

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,740
source software right from the base

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,710
server operating systems to how

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,150
addresses are handled the DNS the

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,240
database the database software web

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,270
server software seventy two percent

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,310
patchy and genex and others

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,310
seventy-seven percent the programming

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,740
languages 71 percent open-source

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,880
software as

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:43,599
a for content management systems and the

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,490
tip the browser's themselves not as much

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,180
fifty-four percent or open-source

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:53,830
browsers there's clearly quite a few

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:57,819
people still running Internet Explorer

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,919
on the desktop obviously that that name

00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,259
are not changed the real power is the

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:07,259
internet it's behind below the browser

00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:11,860
as you as you're probably aware okay

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:14,229
linux use is rising rapidly we have the

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,400
benefit and maybe some of you have gone

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,120
and looked at the linux foundation

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,500
survey they've been doing it each year

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:25,380
for a number of years so there's some

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:28,270
trends starting to appear last year 893

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,599
large enterprise administrators surveyed

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:33,610
i was actually warned not to give the

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,300
impression that they only surveyed large

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,639
system administrators but it's the

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,759
enterprise it's hope that was large and

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:46,389
i don't want to offend anyone with that

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,610
but i was warned that that to just be

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:52,590
clear on what that meant so it's it's

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,940
large enterprise administrators and

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,800
there were several stats you can see

00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,759
them there i won't read them all but the

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:06,130
idea is that linux use is growing

00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:09,520
rapidly in large enterprise and that

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,190
will continue so the bottom two points

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,050
75% have big data concerns and they're

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,169
planning on linux solutions for those

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,090
and a lot of the reason the main reason

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,280
why linux use is growing rapidly is

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,639
two-thirds consider linux to be more

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,630
secure than other operating systems

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:30,360
again that's probably not new

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:32,829
information linux is core to the cloud

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,510
so in the survey maintaining or

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:43,120
increasing linux to support cloud

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:45,520
seventy-four percent agreed and more so

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,800
enterprises increasing the use of linux

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,560
in mission critical workloads over the

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:56,589
past three years it's grown noun most

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,860
recently 273 percent I'm going to go

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:03,070
through some of this some of this is to

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,670
set up the fact that there is demand and

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,529
when we get to there being an

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,910
open-source workforce we're going to

00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:13,410
talk about that we're going to talk

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,420
about the toolkit that's available for

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,610
those going in pursuing a career in open

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,040
source and we'll talk a little bit of

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,290
what we're LPI fits in and what we're

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,360
currently doing I actually expected

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,820
about five or ten people to the

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,430
presentation so I'm pleased to see that

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,320
there's there's as many of you as you

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,610
are and I know that you may not all stay

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,000
if you have stuff to do I appreciate

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,930
that those of you who are now finished

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,890
or five hour energy yeah I can tell you

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,980
are the open-source workforce so there's

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,890
the IT workforce as you know working

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,790
living breathing information technology

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:58,600
as your career and simply put the

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:04,149
open-source workforce is a subcategory

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:07,720
of that we want to really really remind

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:09,880
everyone that you're part of a cause the

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,560
Linux career means being part of a cause

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,850
and Linux is the largest as it says the

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,579
largest collaborative development

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:24,970
project in the history of computing for

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:27,820
me I'm a not I'm a non-technical person

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,600
with a career in links on open source as

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:35,290
well I've been with LPI since 2005 I've

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,199
been the CFO since 2010 and I've talked

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,510
to many many technical people talk to

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:43,570
non-technical people there is there's

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:47,320
many career opportunities but when I see

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,720
the size of the Linux project itself and

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,900
I've been to other conferences where

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,030
people have gone through the history of

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,750
Linux and how linis sent out that first

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,700
email

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,380
and and it wasn't going to be a big

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,800
thing and it turned out to be a big

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,230
thing and the same the same is what is

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,390
happening it happened for LP I you know

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,790
with certifying people and Linux open

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,100
source but I see this and I know that

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,760
even a few years ago from the business

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,830
side there's there's no way you could

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,710
have could have started a company or a

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,200
start-up or worked in in the same way

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,780
that you could now with all the linux

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,700
and open source tools available i don't

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,130
have to i don't have to spend money on

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,440
software licensing just to just to get a

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,780
laptop up and running i can i can use

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,320
google apps for business if i want i can

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,840
i can run a desktop with free software

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,250
and my resources which are very scarce

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,530
in the beginning if i'm starting a

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:48,370
business can be put to much better use

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:52,060
to to marketing to getting yourself out

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:56,470
there so I the size of the project still

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,540
still blows my mind the highest demand

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,460
for Linux pros seen in the enterprise

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,460
with cloud and big data driving system

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:08,620
in hires that shouldn't be a surprise

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:10,300
and the stats I'm a numbers guy and I'm

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,670
almost done with the stats so sorry

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,200
thanks for hanging in to ninety-three

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,380
percent of employers plan to hire a

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,970
Linux pro in the next six months ninety

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,100
percent of hiring managers say it's

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,010
difficult to find Linux pros so you're

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,050
all hiding somewhere you're hiring

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:30,550
managers for whatever reason or having

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,980
trouble finding you and last year an

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,320
increase in Linux salaries was nine

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,320
percent it's above industry average

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,910
seventy-five percent of Linux

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,920
professionals have received a call from

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:49,350
a recruiter in the last six months we

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:52,000
work with a lot of job organizations

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,120
career organizations so we we have

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,160
access to these stats more than a third

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,320
doesn't surprise me more than a third of

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,750
those plan to switch employers in the

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:06,420
next 12 months I don't know if anyone's

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:11,420
here with their boss right now awkward

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:14,550
if you are but but the idea is that

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,000
Linux professionals are in demand a bit

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:21,389
more in demand now perhaps than they

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,269
have been in the past being in demand

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:29,310
means you command more more pay I mean

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,500
it's so it's it's pretty simple that

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,990
doesn't mean you have to switch jobs but

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,910
there's a third of a third of you that

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,740
likely will because the demand is there

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:45,149
and when the demand is there the

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:48,300
opportunity is there a Linux career

00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:50,820
means more coin these are statistics

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,130
that are available we've summarized you

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,320
know here for you average pay increases

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,529
for Linux grows more than double that of

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,089
the average technology professional and

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:04,740
last year saw fifteen percent increase

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:08,639
in bonus payouts I'll mention we have we

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:12,660
have a partner partner of ours odesk is

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,560
their name and we recently launched on

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,470
our website a widget into the odesk

00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:24,300
opportunities so you could go today to

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:26,250
the job widget and look up what jobs are

00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,550
currently available there's thousands

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:33,060
there that lends professionals can apply

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,829
to so that's been happening in the

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,740
background for the past couple of months

00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:40,110
they've been able to statistically and

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,790
this isn't public yet I'm not even sure

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,949
if I'm supposed to share it but I guess

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,140
I would be the one to give permission

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:49,140
whether it could be shared or not so i

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,920
guess i can i guess it can share it the

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:56,069
professional professionally certified

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,100
linux folks are making 25 percent more

00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:03,839
money than the non-certified and they're

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:06,720
in contracts 75% longer than their

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:11,480
counterparts we've always suspected that

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:16,170
we've we've intuitively known that and

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:20,209
now the statistics are proving itself

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,209
out it's it can be seen

00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:30,139
linux use rising rapidly again the big

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:34,160
orange bar there shows almost eighty

00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:36,980
percent that use of linux in your

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,129
organization will increase some will

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,839
stay the same some are not sure some

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:44,929
people want to do a survey are never

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,230
sure of anything and one-point-four

00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:50,149
percent will decrease the use we talk in

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,999
the office about what that person was

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,790
actually thinking perhaps they prefer

00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:59,660
less secure software and they'd rather

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:06,230
pay license fees we we really don't know

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:08,119
the tech job market itself with this the

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,160
sled met meant to represent is

00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:12,769
unemployment in the US was eight point

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,970
three percent the tech sector fared

00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:19,540
somewhat better at 5.3 2011 the tech

00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,489
sector in 2012 unemployment

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,220
three-point-eight percent things are

00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:28,189
things are looking up the job market is

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,850
looking up in tech it hasn't been an

00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:35,779
easy few years I was in Mountain View

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,429
yesterday we how about another

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,869
organization that we're talking to a

00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:44,209
not-for-profit organization that's

00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:47,239
getting into the evangelizing and

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:49,549
training of big data and cloud

00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:52,939
technology sole purpose of trying to

00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:55,549
clarify what it really is the industry

00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:59,989
itself has done a good job in and making

00:16:55,549 --> 00:17:03,139
it pretty pretty on unclear as to what

00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:07,130
big data and cloud are so we're hoping

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:10,490
that we can start bringing more clarity

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:13,220
to that I guess what I'm saying is while

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,260
I was there I saw buildings going up

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,350
there was construction there was a lot

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,579
of activity at the event that I was

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,549
everyone that was giving their

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,399
presentation Tom Siebel siebel systems

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,379
was one of them at the end he was giving

00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:29,720
out his email saying if you know anyone

00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,890
that knows linux and open source isn't

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,880
interested in working

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:37,610
big data have them email this address

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,550
there's a there's a demand now and the

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:44,840
demand is growing I don't think there's

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:49,220
been a better time I mentioned about the

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:52,790
open source careers toolkit you

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,890
hopefully seen that there's a demand for

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,860
for your skills there's certain things

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,670
that I think will will assist you in

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,320
getting that interview at least you got

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,200
to get the job yourself at some point

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,640
but I think we can certainly help you in

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:16,370
presenting yourself as a professional in

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:20,450
linux and open source what you need for

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:22,670
things what we say some education that

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,470
should be at this point you should be

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,530
able to take a box or be close to taking

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,920
a box that you're educated in some way

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:32,990
getting experience that's always been

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,940
the challenge do you do you go into that

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,290
first interview and and say oh I was

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,050
hoping you guys would give me the

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:42,730
experience that's why I'm here that

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:45,650
probably not going to work too well

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,170
approval provable passion and linux and

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:52,460
open source some of you have shown that

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:55,280
already and an independent proof of your

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,140
skill set and as i said you probably

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,790
have the first one it's the other ones

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:04,400
that i want to explain a little bit more

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,810
experienced doesn't just happen you have

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,820
to pursue it you have to make it happen

00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,570
it's an individual choice and you have

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,580
to be motivated it doesn't have to be

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:16,370
first paying gig that you have

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,040
experienced you have organizations

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:22,340
already in your life that you belong to

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:27,530
our guys that you hang out with a group

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,990
a group of peers alumni oftentimes

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:33,070
there's a need for some kind of IT

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,960
support so you can volunteer with them

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,330
set up an email set up a calendar

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,090
service everyone you know at that point

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,720
a website practice some of the things

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,480
that you've been playing around with

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,900
in Linux and set up and stand up some of

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,960
these services for them that can go on

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:57,299
your resume you may still be in school

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,940
it may have recently graduated if your

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,429
institution has a computer lab or there

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,799
are clubs at your school they're often

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:09,600
looking for volunteers doesn't pay

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,900
necessarily maybe maybe some expenses

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:22,980
but that experience will go on your

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:25,890
resume is anyone here already involved

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:31,490
in one or more open source projects

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:37,830
contributing in some way and one two

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:39,990
three three people or so some so open

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:46,320
source projects and there are there are

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:49,230
many and and you go 200 low net what's

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,530
the other one sourceforge github find

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,960
one that appeals to you find one that's

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,870
that's something close to your heart

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,400
that you'd like to work on and

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,630
contribute to it ask some questions you

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,799
know get to know some people on the

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:08,880
project and contribute that doesn't mean

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,980
just writing code it can be writing

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
documentation the end they'll and

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,380
they'll list what they need help with

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,200
does anyone have a second language here

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,580
so right away they already need you

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,789
because they need things to be

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,419
translated there's there's lots of work

00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:29,039
for translation you're now involved in a

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,159
project and is your name becomes

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,470
associated with projects that's part of

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,950
your profile or you start to raise your

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,510
profile someone searches your name you

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,850
know you have you have something

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:46,340
concrete to go with it work on those

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,340
projects can go on your resume

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:54,070
demonstrate your passion well you've

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,090
you've done that by attending southeast

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,650
linux fest if you if you're writing a

00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,010
cover letter and you submit it and I'm

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,960
the HR manager and you say i love linux

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,170
and i love open source and i want a job

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,929
with your company let me work for you

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:12,640
the hiring manager is going to go to

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,830
google and they're going to search on

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,750
your name this is how it happens and we

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:21,130
talked to these people all the time we

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:23,440
talked to hiring organizations we we

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,940
were at Netflix last month and we were

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,590
talking to the chief architect and he

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,049
said well if anyone wants to work on our

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,419
stuff I just go and Google their name

00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:34,900
and see what projects they've worked on

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,429
what code they have up and I'll look at

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,470
it and if it's skid code they'll

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:41,500
probably work for netflix if it's not

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:44,890
they they won't and that's that's how

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:48,400
it's happening now if you say that you

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:51,940
love linux and I google your name I want

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,020
to see proof that that's the case you

00:22:51,940 --> 00:23:00,010
have a blog you have maybe maybe photos

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,960
of you here or at the booth there's

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,929
pictures pictures taken of you

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,669
volunteering handing out snow cones for

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:09,400
a project you know whatever that is

00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:13,690
wearing your project t-shirt those all

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:17,710
go online and that's how you'll be

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:23,080
discovered what will I find when I

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:26,350
google your name is this that is this

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,630
all that's there that's okay you know

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,820
that's you know and if this pictures

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,940
taken at the after party tonight that's

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,130
okay nothing wrong with that but if

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,010
that's all that's there and I'm a hiring

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,620
manager I'm going to wonder I might I

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,750
might want to party with you after but I

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,120
think at least you're probably not going

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,190
to get a job based on that alone I want

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,620
to see some of the other things that we

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:55,360
talked about want to see your blog your

00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:02,410
your interaction at events

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:06,100
other projects that you've worked on you

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,250
need certifications so I believe this

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,630
and our organization believes this a

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:16,750
college degree will set you up a

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:20,470
technical technical program will give

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,690
you the baseline for your career for

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,780
many years to come but we're talking

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,540
about becoming immediately employable

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,380
with an organization and so we say

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:35,169
certification is an adapter that goes

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,130
between your college degree and that job

00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:43,809
and the first interview and and connects

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:47,320
the two together an independent

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:50,470
third-party metric is the skills need to

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,340
be at a predictable level and that is

00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:58,690
because HR managers people doing the

00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:02,710
hiring aren't aren't always technical

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:05,049
people they have job requisitions that

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,880
have been given to them from the the

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:10,360
chief technology officer and they say go

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,169
find me 50 people that can do this and

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,610
then HR person will go and they'll do

00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:20,440
their search that go through channels

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:22,690
and they'll say well how do I know that

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,840
these the people out there are can do

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,429
what they say well what we're seeing in

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,590
North America recently and it's been

00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:32,530
this way in the rest of the world for

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,440
quite a while and in North America the

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,030
certification is becoming that baseline

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,400
there's nothing there's there's nothing

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:42,510
else to go on people in the past had

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,010
many years of experience to fall back on

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,429
not not so much the case there's more

00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:51,600
jobs that need to be filled than people

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:54,700
out there who just have experienced

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,740
exist so we're talking about those

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,740
coming out of school those without

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,690
experience yet that's where the

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,880
certification gives the HR manager a

00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,710
chance to to match you up to that job

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,919
req that's how you're going to get the

00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,919
job

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:18,040
grow with LPI so I wanted to give a

00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:20,740
little bit about what we do and I

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,380
noticed every time I say about or out

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,290
that I'm giving away my nationality a

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:34,220
little bit LPI was started in Canada in

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:38,480
1999 and yeah and I've only been in and

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,780
the US for about a year and even though

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,670
my kids already changed their their

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,170
accent so they didn't get beat up at

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,260
school or whatever I still have still

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,840
have my accent with me so we've given

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:58,280
350,000 exams since since inception more

00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:02,060
more recently we have well over 130,000

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,620
professionals worldwide now of those and

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,470
we have we have about a quarter of a

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,180
million alumni attached to the

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:11,150
organization right now not everyone has

00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,880
completed their certification yet we

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:17,960
have over 350 training partners around

00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,600
the world and we manage those training

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,160
partners through master affiliates which

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,680
we have in 27 regions around the world

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:33,340
our exams have been translated by the

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:36,650
community in 27 languages and we attend

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,540
close to 100 events a year actually like

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:42,650
the southeast linux fest that we're at

00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:47,600
today we are a community based

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:50,930
organization in 1999 the community some

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,420
some technology guys up in Toronto said

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,130
you know hey what if what if we had a

00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,140
Linux certification i said i don't know

00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,380
let's find out they sent out their email

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:04,010
to the to the community list at the time

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,860
and the response was absolutely let's do

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:11,060
a vendor-neutral certification that's

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,160
tested at the command line and the

00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,620
overwhelming response was to do it

00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:18,230
that's when they put it together that

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,929
community still builds the exam

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:24,500
today all of the job task analysis all

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:28,280
of the item writing and the item review

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,860
is still done by the LPI community and

00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,320
we have subject matter experts around

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:38,590
the world that do that as well as the

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:41,410
translation of those items so that

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:44,780
community input resulted in the exam

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,340
product showcase that we have today you

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,220
can see the different levels that are

00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,220
there and all of this is available on

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,140
our website and and a lot of this too if

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,590
you go to our booth that we have here

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:00,080
and talk to Brooke she'd be happy to

00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,820
explain to you a little bit more detail

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,450
wouldn't you broke no no she's leaving

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,309
the riff dishes yeah you would go back

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:12,340
to the booth in case someone walks out

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:16,790
right now and we've just recently put a

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:19,429
Linux essentials and the reason the

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,860
reason we did that so I'll go back is

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,299
the community for years has been asking

00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:29,030
for something that's a little more

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:30,679
entry-level our level one exam for epic

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,260
one certification there they're

00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,230
difficult you can't guess your way

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:39,200
through the answers you you will need

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,150
oftentimes you know a year a couple

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,320
years work experience certainly helps

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:48,350
it's a tough exam so if you're new to

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,510
linux and open source that that could

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:54,830
have been a bit of a barrier linux

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,320
essentials was what we came up with

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:00,710
anywhere from zero to twenty five

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,929
percent knowledge of linux you'll you

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:05,419
will receive a certificate it's not a

00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:07,730
professional certification but it's a

00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:10,130
starting point and if you're new to

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,470
linux and open source I would consider

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:17,000
getting some information on that because

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:19,130
it it's it's a gateway to future career

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,929
in linux and open source that's what we

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:25,900
feel wanted to bring your attention to

00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,810
something else that we talked about

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:34,170
about

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:36,180
and comptia linux+ is our exam now

00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:39,960
they're a partner of ours and have been

00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:43,080
since spring of 2010 they did have a

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,320
certification was one test and they had

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,190
decided to drop that certification and

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,160
just brand it with our existing level

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:56,400
one certification so this is important

00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:00,960
because if you start your certification

00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,900
path with comptia linux+ and you agree

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,550
to have your exam results shared with

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:11,730
LPI then LP i will automatically award

00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:15,240
you at no extra charge the l pick one

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:20,370
certification and in that certification

00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:23,520
packet you will have a request form to

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:26,360
fill out and send to sue say who will at

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,520
no extra charge award you there CLA

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,670
certification so we went together with

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:36,720
our these two particular partners to do

00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:39,360
this and say three certifications for

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,000
the price of one this is important in

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,120
the context here because we're building

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,880
a resume and this allows you to put

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,920
three certifications on your resume and

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,780
that's quite likely that's two more than

00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,540
many other people might have on your

00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,150
resume that's an advantage and you're

00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:02,040
looking for every advantage you can for

00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:08,310
that first interview and for that first

00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:11,190
job I put this up as I talked about the

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:13,860
Linux essentials it is in the process of

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,960
being put into many technical schools

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,180
and community colleges the Linux

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:24,570
Essentials program is being adapted into

00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:26,970
their their IT programs now and a

00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,550
requirement of that program will be them

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,570
taking the test and this will this will

00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:35,940
finally put linux and open source as an

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:39,060
option in the school curriculum and

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,419
that's that's a big change that's

00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,730
something with

00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:46,029
anyone involved in linux and open source

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:49,210
has been I would have liked to see many

00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:50,499
years ago so you get you get to two

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,440
people a little bit younger before

00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:55,859
they're embedded in whatever proprietary

00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,039
software they might already be using

00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:02,350
trained on this is another option so if

00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:05,859
we say hey you know there's linux and

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:08,710
open source options out there have a

00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:16,119
look that's that's that's important for

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:18,940
all of us i want to say again you've

00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:21,879
seen the demand for linux and open

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,190
source professionals you know that the

00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:27,669
job market is growing the job market is

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:31,359
paying more for linux professionals than

00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:33,730
then non linux professionals that seem

00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,919
and it's paying more for certified

00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,289
professionals clearly so that the

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,980
baseline can be established and they can

00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:44,559
eliminate the unknown of basing it on

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:48,159
experience alone but you have to do it

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,929
you have to take charge of your career

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,789
if you want to work in something that

00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:55,389
you know you're passionate about for

00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:58,210
whatever reason and get paid to play on

00:33:55,389 --> 00:34:00,309
linux or linux servers that's that's

00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,529
absolutely possible you're going to need

00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:05,440
to do do some things to make that appt

00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:07,389
and i appreciate your time i try to go

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,179
through these you know fairly fairly

00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:14,379
quickly get a bit of time back to you

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:16,780
you know but appreciate you coming in if

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:22,409
you have any questions i will take them

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,409
now yes sir

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:43,010
yes I can I don't know offhand how many

00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:46,790
microsoft certified people there are

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:52,510
those probably maybe there's people here

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:55,010
that have that certification and at OPI

00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,470
we have to be really careful but you

00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,230
know how how we talk about other

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:03,799
certifications all IT certifications are

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:07,730
important some some IT certifications

00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:10,700
are very product specific and we don't

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:13,460
feel hiring managers necessarily don't

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:17,349
feel always give the best okays now

00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,339
there are I would say microsoft

00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:22,180
certification they may have the highest

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:27,319
number of certified people in the world

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:30,619
why I'll tell you it's not it's maybe

00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:32,569
not as difficult as some of the other IT

00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:35,510
certifications of the out pick

00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:38,359
certifications or some of the some of

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:42,140
the other limbic Linux vendor

00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:45,859
certifications for as a breakdown for

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:49,309
epic certifications I would say the rest

00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:53,780
of the world versus North America ninety

00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:57,430
percent to ten percent maybe more we we

00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:00,200
certify thousands of Japanese

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,069
professionals on a monthly basis it's a

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,200
promotion requirement in that country

00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:09,230
Japan is our biggest market central

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,799
europe is next latin america brazil is

00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:15,829
third there's there's always being a

00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:18,020
culture in north america of well i have

00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:20,690
the experience and not just for epic

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:24,500
certification for any IT certification

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:26,630
i've had that talk probably 100 people

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,059
and people in my organization have had

00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:32,510
that talk with hundreds more about the

00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:35,550
value of an IT certification and and the

00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:40,710
rest of the world has been certifying

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:43,020
for a decade and a half now in North

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:46,260
America in the past year and a half

00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,390
we're seeing we're seeing that changed

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:53,430
drastically because the the jobs are

00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:56,310
there and there's supply has not has not

00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:00,210
kept up with demand yeah I was wondering

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:03,570
eyes since the demand for Linux prose is

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:06,150
so big right now if you have experience

00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:09,390
with Linux but no certification would a

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,440
lot of companies you know hire you

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,100
anyway and then pay for your

00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:18,210
certification it's possible I mean you

00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:20,790
have to sell yourself that way I would

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,190
never but you gotta try right it

00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:26,640
certainly certainly coming in certified

00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:29,370
wouldn't hurt what we've seen in and

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,270
this is again a North America statistic

00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:36,600
companies here do not seem to like to

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:41,100
pay for certification or education they

00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:43,230
want you coming ready to play on day one

00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,650
and what that could have been the

00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:50,850
economy the last ten years I can't save

00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:54,210
it it's likely that the US companies for

00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:56,040
whatever reason just expect you to come

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,140
prepared and I don't know if the budgets

00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,970
are there to pay for certification some

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,070
smaller companies maybe you have a

00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:05,900
better chance because there's there's

00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,900
less layers of approval to go through

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,890
yes sir

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,589
so and I would encourage all of you to

00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,200
go on the website there's a lot more

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:29,980
detail but I can say that predominantly

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:34,089
level one is geared to system

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:37,750
administrator and i think i have so

00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:41,109
level one junior level one to two years

00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:47,830
work experience and working on servers

00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:51,280
and small site experience and then you

00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,900
can see going up the levels up to level

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,750
three and then the level three electives

00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:59,470
your enterprise wide and three plus

00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:01,570
years work experience all of the all of

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,780
the exam objectives are on the website

00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:11,680
you can actually see what content it's

00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:13,480
it's covering at that point certainly

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,450
the level one is geared to assist in

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,000
Minya if there's a lot more content on

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:21,040
there but it had its inception in sis

00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,310
admit i don't think that's necessarily

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,060
the case anymore and and i don't know

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:30,250
the objectives offhand and i probably

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,770
couldn't get three questions right out

00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,980
of the 60 myself I'm just admitting I'm

00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:39,250
not not a technical guy i might get

00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,470
three on the linux essentials I've been

00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,750
I specifically have not looked at the

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:49,270
test because I want to actually try to

00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:52,320
take that at some point anyone yes sir

00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,320
black t-shirt

00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:01,339
work I observe that when you're looking

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:05,359
for work longer you're out the partner

00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:08,029
it is and i found got the advice if you

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,190
pursue certifications while you're an

00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:12,769
employee it sends a signal to potential

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:28,249
employers that you're trying to improve

00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:29,989
given the situation that's right and and

00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:32,299
i was talking with someone else who

00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:37,869
earlier who said that in where they

00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:41,359
lived there was assistance unemployment

00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:44,170
programs think it was geared to any

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,789
comptia certifications so there are ways

00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,470
depending on your situation to get

00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:51,140
assistance towards that certification

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,759
and that's the time certainly that's the

00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,640
time to do it if you have extra time on

00:40:52,759 --> 00:41:01,359
your hands although i'm sure halo is a

00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,359
lot of fun yes

00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:07,880
enterprise level what I guess your

00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:11,510
customers or I would say the other way

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:15,680
hiring people want on the test how does

00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,660
it matched up well for the higher levels

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,560
and we did a lot a lot of that work on

00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,620
the higher levels came from Japan and in

00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,150
Japan we have involved in the

00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:31,160
organization they're all of the big

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:34,250
companies hitachi fujitsu NEC all have

00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:38,330
seats on our Advisory Committee in Japan

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:40,790
and so that's those often our hiring

00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:44,710
managers as well as technical people and

00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:48,860
so they determine the initial job tasks

00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:58,850
that we then build the objectives on and

00:41:48,860 --> 00:42:01,370
then put the questions towards the job

00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,220
of a sysadmin in Japan personal America

00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:06,800
there are some similarities there's also

00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:09,320
colorful different yet significant

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,560
cultural differences yes did everyone

00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:16,310
else hear the question that was asking

00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:19,700
so just talking about sis admins our sis

00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:22,660
admins everywhere but there's some

00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,490
cultures and Japan is one of them where

00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:30,050
where there's a lot there's a lot of

00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:33,260
value put into where you stand how if

00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:35,870
you're certified and what job level that

00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,590
then gets you to the other part of the

00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:41,150
question was just where do we where do

00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,630
we get the information to build the

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,970
tests and that was why I was talking

00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,240
about those organizations in Japan as an

00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:52,280
example that supply that information

00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,640
from the jobs so we know what to work

00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,640
towards

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:06,750
over here that the tests are multiple

00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,720
choice and fill in the blank they are

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:13,589
obviously put through rigorous

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:16,380
psychometric testing prior to and there

00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:19,260
are items new items on the test all the

00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:23,339
time that our beta items you wouldn't

00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,680
know in taking them and the the items

00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:29,130
are weighted as well to each objective

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,339
in a certain way so that I believe a cut

00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:34,890
score past is 500 out of 800 and that's

00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:45,660
as that's as detailed as I understand

00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:47,250
the testing processes so yeah we have we

00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,070
have thought about that and there are

00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:53,040
other tests that do that and the

00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:56,790
challenge the challenge is first of all

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,430
costs to deliver a test like that so

00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,680
although there are some technologies

00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:06,450
that are that we're looking at that will

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,030
allow study simulations to do that that

00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:12,089
rolling that out worldwide as a test

00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:14,730
itself has has limitations as a

00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:18,000
not-for-profit Institute remember we're

00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:20,310
also engaged in bringing our test to

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,589
developing countries that's why we have

00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:28,710
affiliates in East Africa and parts of

00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:30,510
Asia and parts of Latin America where

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,119
sometimes the internet connection is

00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:36,000
even a problem in which case we're

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,450
bringing a paper test still to those

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,220
people it's not as many as it was but it

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:45,930
does still happen because our core

00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:47,880
belief is that a global standard in

00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,550
Linux should be anywhere and it should

00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,550
allow that person regardless of their

00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:59,359
economic situation to still compete you

00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:59,359
know for those jobs remotely absolutely

00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:04,859
well they're they're administered every

00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:07,410
day in the sense because they're

00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:09,780
available in the view testing center so

00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:14,040
you can go and take a cbt at view your

00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:18,780
schedule ahead of time we also hold the

00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:22,020
paper test here at these events at a cut

00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,660
rate you know hurts me to say but yes

00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:28,980
you can take the test at a significantly

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:35,280
deeply discounted rate but only while

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:37,020
you're here tomorrow yes no LPI it just

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,530
does the test for the certification

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,910
doesn't actually give you like you you

00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,819
don't have in classes or anything like

00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:47,869
to train for the certification yes and

00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:51,540
that's on purpose and we do have

00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:53,640
approved training partners which simply

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,300
says that we have I'll pick approved

00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,220
people training but to be a truly

00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,339
vendor-independent objective

00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:04,829
certification we can't we can't really

00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:06,480
be involved in the training because then

00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:08,940
you could really just be training to the

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,329
test and that takes away credibility so

00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:15,780
we've always said since inception we

00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:18,990
will test you we will certify you but we

00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,369
won't specifically trained you we can we

00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,890
can mentor you we can provide

00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:25,200
information and we can direct you to

00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,420
training partners and all kinds of

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,970
content on our website there's a

00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:33,030
marketplace available it's not our

00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,670
content but it's anyone who who

00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,369
publishes to our test objectives and all

00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:41,220
the major publishers do you can you can

00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:44,220
get that content online through our

00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:47,760
marketplace that that's not our content

00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:51,569
then that that's not a revenue generator

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,760
for us but it is there you most do most

00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:55,730
times schools

00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:59,300
programs now more and more now they do

00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,750
yes and there's there's initiatives

00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:05,450
happening right now we have things

00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:08,030
happening to bring the community college

00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:12,320
sector on board we have another partner

00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:15,650
whose just finishing hands on linux labs

00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,780
like the other the other gentleman had

00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,310
had questions so that's that's going to

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,760
be available at the community college

00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:26,300
for their students to go in and set up

00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:29,960
virtual servers work on them fix them

00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:32,210
break them in a lab environment that

00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,940
will happen in the college course itself

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:42,160
and prepare them for taking the tests

00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:47,870
afterwards alright what I have no more

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:50,810
5-hour energy left to give out any other

00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:54,040
questions it's supposed to last for five

00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:58,060
hours the energy that is not the talk I

00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,060
got four hours to burn

00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,660
so i'll be at the booth for a little

00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:07,239
while I'll hang out here for a little

00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:10,339
while and lots of information online and

00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:13,279
i'll stop now i won't point out that

00:48:10,339 --> 00:48:16,789
people are yawning because that's

00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:20,109
allowed all right how do we finish this

00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:20,109
I'll just stop talking

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:34,260
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,420
way to better utilize all your resources

00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,870
and it makes managing all your resources

00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:43,730
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:47,220
happening in open source the

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:49,020
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,360
of the community and the speed at which

00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,130
these are these you know these these

00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,440
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:58,290
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,290
that really shows the power of the of

00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:03,740
the open source community it is global

00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:07,290
and it's definitely because of the users

00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:13,260
community people are extremely friendly

00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:14,970
and always ready to help if you go on

00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,160
tire see any day you'll see these guys

00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,830
helping each other out and they're all

00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,510
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:24,530
product is transparent for everyone

00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:27,450
everyone can look at the code base

00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:29,190
everyone can see how close darkest is

00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:35,040
being built nothing nothing is

00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:37,710
proprietary everything is open in many

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,880
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:45,660
unborn health cloudstack the most

00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:49,560
exciting event in recent memory for he

00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:52,230
was our first developer boot camp

00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,870
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:58,830
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:49:54,870 --> 00:50:03,000
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:05,820
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,370
chairs in the room twice everything

00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,700
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:14,670
is open source and so I don't think that

00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,440
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:19,470
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,200
computing and so i think it's i think

00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:23,550
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,660
about cloud computing you're really

00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:30,210
talking about open source cloud

00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:33,240
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:35,370
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,660
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:42,330
in each data centers these hardware is

00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:45,810
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:48,510
to handle number one that mass scale

00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:51,690
number two it's designed to handle the

00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:54,240
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:57,780
deployments started working on college

00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:01,110
attack over four years ago and it was

00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:03,810
the original set of people working on it

00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:07,890
had a background of delivering software

00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:12,150
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:15,750
lots of users actually using it high

00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:18,840
availability is a key feature multiple

00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:21,000
hypervisors support different network

00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,030
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,800
better while step management server can

00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:29,490
be deployed in different physical

00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,140
machines it definitely has a huge

00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:36,120
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:38,730
there's a major movie studio that they

00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:42,000
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:43,980
to transcode video and i thought that

00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,630
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,900
more fascinating is what they did during

00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:51,690
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,829
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:54,690
lunch was over they would this

00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:58,829
all the instances and go back to doing

00:51:54,690 --> 00:52:00,450
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:02,519
so many different aspects and there's no

00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,920
one person that's kind of like a master

00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:08,999
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,339
as a project is going to be one of the

00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:15,299
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:20,729
most feature fallen and and robust

00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:23,630
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:23,630
living through the clouds dag

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,560
most enterprises today realize that

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,210
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,580
enough to keep their network seen from

00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:47,650
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,690
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:51,820
popular lately that adds that extra

00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,490
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,260
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:58,450
know is that some two-factor

00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,670
authentication solutions they're better

00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,700
than others like two-factor strong

00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,980
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,930
beyond other authentication systems by

00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:10,990
being less expensive easier to implement

00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:13,480
and easier to use giving software-based

00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:16,360
token clients built to run on all major

00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,930
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,280
Android these tokens utilize a

00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:23,680
public/private key combination that's

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,630
generated on device so there aren't any

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,150
shared secrets flying around for

00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:31,000
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,860
special handling instead all keys are

00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,350
kept secure and private between the

00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,540
requesting token and your server which

00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:39,150
you control in-house making it the most

00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,830
secure way possible to perform

00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:44,620
authentication encryption and with an

00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:47,410
extensive flexible API and support for

00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:49,390
protocols like Alda and radius wicket

00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,760
works with any enterprise network

two-factor authentication for the first

00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,680
time or just ready to ditch your

use strong authentication from wicked

00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:21,050
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,000
ago we could not have imagined that

00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:25,190
asterisk would not only become the most

00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,350
widely adopted open source communication

00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:29,360
software on the planet but that it would

00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:31,880
impact the entire industry in the way

00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,890
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,500
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:38,450
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,550
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,960
transition of power from the hands of

00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:44,240
the traditional proprietary phone

00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,610
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,560
administrators of phone systems using

00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,790
this power our customers have created

00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,740
all sorts of business changing

00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,570
applications from small office phone

00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:56,090
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:57,710
the international carrier networks in

00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:59,480
fact there's even an entire country

00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,090
those communications of a structure runs

00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,010
on esters the gym has always been about

00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,720
creating technology that expands

00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,910
communications capabilities in ways that

00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,080
we could never have imagined and that's

00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:11,480
part of what's game-changing about

00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,180
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:16,280
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,380
IP phones that extends control of the

00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,150
user all the way to the desktop the

00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,860
launch of these new products represents

00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,840
the next phase indigenous history of

00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,360
innovation these are the first and only

00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,070
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,630
power of Astra's when we first discussed

00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:31,670
our expectations for building a family

00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:33,800
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,540
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,190
the team to build the phones such that

00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,380
they were easy to install integrate

00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:41,210
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,790
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,410
that goal user feedback is validating

00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,540
that when it comes to operation with

00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,970
Astra space systems including our own

00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,520
Switchvox based product these are the

00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,840
easiest to use best integrated most

00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,420
interoperable products on the market

00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,420
today the digitally phones will

00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,500
initially include three IP des hommes

00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,420
uniquely designed to complement any

00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,280
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,950
these phones are different for a number

00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,620
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,030
designed for use with esters secondly

00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,490
we've made it really easy to

00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:15,050
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:16,730
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:18,440
to access information inside of

00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,170
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,690
between

00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:23,579
application and the phone additionally

00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,859
we've created an applications engine

00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:28,049
that allows users and developers to

00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:30,660
create and run their own apps on the

00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:32,910
following and finally we've done all of

00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,619
this at a very compelling price point at

00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:36,809
Digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:39,180
give our customers the best value in

00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:40,470
business phone systems and also give

00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,569
them the power to create their own

00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:44,369
solutions or any communications

00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:46,049
challenge well continue to push the

00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:47,819
boundaries not only to make Astra's

00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:49,710
cooler faster and more technologically

00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:51,270
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:53,460
what communications even easier and

00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:56,329
together we'll change the way the world

00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,329
communication again

00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:39,180
your customers rely on your website or

00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:41,580
application if it's slower

00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:44,520
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:46,320
and costs you money keeping your

00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,839
business critical systems humming along

00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:52,150
requires insight into what they're doing

00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:54,099
your system metrics tells stories

00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:56,109
stories that can reveal performance

00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:58,450
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:57:56,109 --> 00:58:00,009
other problems but how do you keep an

00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:02,650
eye on all of your systems performance

00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:05,710
metrics in real-time and record this

00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:07,450
data for later analysis enter longview

00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,460
the new way to see what's really going

00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:11,619
on under the hood the long view

00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,690
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:16,150
of all your systems providing you with a

00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:19,509
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:22,089
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:23,859
load and network usage click a specific

00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:26,259
system to access its individual

00:58:23,859 --> 00:58:28,769
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:58:26,259 --> 00:58:31,180
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:32,859
comprehensive network data including

00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,170
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:36,729
available on the network tab and disk

00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,650
rights and free space on the disk

00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:41,499
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:44,019
displays usage statistics for individual

00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:46,210
processes the system info tab shows

00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:48,430
listening services active connections

00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:50,559
and available updates adding long view

00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,269
to a system is easy just click the

00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,400
button copy the one line installation

00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:56,859
command then run the command on your

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,569
linux system to complete the process the

00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:00,759
agent will begin collecting data and

00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:02,570
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:59:00,759 --> 00:59:05,150
start rolling

00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:07,520
use longview to gain visibility into

00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:11,260
your servers so when your website or app

00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,260
