the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit WWF selinux phase or

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,810
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:29,210
2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,489
possible feel free to take your time

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,530
right hi I'm Mike Brown I'm with a team

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,590
at arch linux arm and today i'm going to

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,379
be talking about linux on arm and how it

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,360
entered you can interface with the world

00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:47,219
match me button alright so Who am I i am

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,070
not an expert but i do know what I'm

00:00:47,219 --> 00:01:00,690
talking about sometimes I've been

00:00:50,070 --> 00:01:03,480
working with the left button alright so

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,689
I working with Linux in sometime around

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,290
the 2 point 0 points something mark it's

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,670
been a while and I've been doing working

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,299
with arm-based advice about five years

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,470
now although I have been breaking things

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:24,979
for about 25 years and I'm only 30 and

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:29,759
cats all right who knows what arm is

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:31,829
general raise of hands all right so most

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,079
most people have heard of arm from the

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,759
Raspberry Pi which has got a lot of

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,850
press in the past year arm is a kind of

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,500
chip manufacturer it's a chip

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,009
manufacturer kind of like Intel or AMD

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,240
or motorola but they just license the

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,689
technology and it's made by different

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,759
companies a lot of them have come

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,530
because they're low power so they're

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,390
actually quite ubiquitous now I'm

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,329
assuming that all of you have an ARM

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,610
processor on your person in your phone

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,950
your phone has an if your Android or

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,190
Apple it's running ninety percent chance

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,509
is running on an ARM processor they're

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,850
so ubiquitous that you can find them

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,670
almost anywhere

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,480
flip it all right so interfacing of the

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,630
world what do I mean you know our do we

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,980
know is right you have this Arduino you

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,320
have this thing it can do all kinds of

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,050
things with you know flick switches

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,380
process things you know do little tiny

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:33,560
things you can't really do much with

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,290
that on you know with the world you can

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,520
buy pieces to add on but it's kind of

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,030
difficult you kind of limited in what

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,500
you can do flip automate home automation

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,900
you know turning things off tracking

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,690
things data logging and anything you

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:57,050
want to do click so why use an arm

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,430
device most arm devices are more quite a

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,710
bit more powerful especially when you're

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,400
talking about running linux on them most

00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:06,080
of them are armed v 5 or higher so

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,290
you're going to have typically anywhere

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,800
from 400 megahertz all the way up to 2

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,470
gigahertz speed with multi-core

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,360
gigabytes of memory gigabytes of storage

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:23,150
on them on a little tiny board that you

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:26,780
get that big click they typically run

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,690
less than 5 watts of power and they're

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,240
fast Raspberry Pi I'm default is 700

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,160
megahertz which clocks hood gigahertz

00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,970
the all winter a 1x which is on the

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,210
cubieboard the hack buries the melee

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,060
100's the whole bunch of Chinese piece

00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,500
made pieces they were on a gigahertz the

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,810
big the new beaglebone black is a

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,490
gigahertz and they're all cheap and

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,280
their lesson fill out of me less than 50

00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:57,620
bucks so you can do this with an arduino

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,060
you know you log daddy you can click

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,450
things you can send things up to

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,930
internet click once or do we know about

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,140
30 bucks can find cheap knockoffs for 20

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,510
more time but an Ethernet shield

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,510
typically around 40 bucks so you add the

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:18,380
math that's you know 60 70 bucks that

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:21,700
you can do with on an arm PC or arm

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:28,100
device that you can do a lot cheaper

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:32,510
alright so secret I still using Arduino

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,860
and I still leave this computer on

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,690
twenty-four/seven so I'm not power

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,730
conservative it's I've used a computer

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:47,500
that's drawing several hundred watts of

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:50,150
power on all the time but hey click it

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,670
biggest thing when dealing with arm and

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:58,420
dealing with anything in computing in

00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:02,300
general is click on it the right tool I

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,570
can't stress this enough people come to

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,840
me i'm with the team and I do a lot of

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,950
support for our Linux arm and we see a

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,530
lot of people come in that wanted to do

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,110
this you know they want to do clustering

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,080
of raspberry PI's like why would you

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,760
want to do that it's for clustering

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,280
reservoirs is just a proof of concept

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,890
there's no real application for it

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,070
whatsoever when you can take it and go

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:33,080
to bestbuy by three 200pcs stick them in

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,840
a closet and you have ten times

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,280
computing power of four hundred pies it

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,470
doesn't make any sense so a few examples

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,620
of what you can you know things that you

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,300
can do for automation and stuff you want

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,310
to turn something on an hour after it

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,330
gets dark you can do that you can do

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,820
that with pretty much anything you want

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,240
you can do with you know transistors and

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,290
timers and build something but a lot of

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,630
times you know it would be really easy

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,690
to write with an Arduino you you know

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,960
right hey when the analog read is less

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:11,419
than 1 volt wait 30 minutes and then

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:13,190
turn the switch on really easy you want

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,800
to take 20 megapixel pictures and render

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,020
them and blender really fast you're not

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,880
going to do that on a raspberry pi

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,140
you're not going to do we know you're

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,810
going to want a big computer to do that

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:28,340
so it's kind of one of those things but

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,350
I want to be able to check on my cats

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,800
feed them and make sure my fish tank

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:38,560
isn't becoming fish stew

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:41,330
that's actually what I'm doing so I did

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,340
write using raspberry pi which I kind of

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,950
actually don't like but we're going to

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,030
just avoid that question I started

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,200
logging temperatures because i want to

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,790
see how hot it got and what kind of

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,170
fluctuations i got because one day i

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,030
noticed that my fish tank was like 85

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:58,100
degrees and no you don't like that Oh

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:03,350
anima dad a nerd I like data sites and

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:08,210
they make me happy so here is my graph

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,040
of my apartment I fish tropical fish

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,470
tend to be lying you know in from 22 to

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,450
28 degrees centigrade so you know I

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,840
wanted to see I actually peek up above

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:22,210
28 a couple times and I that's where i

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,070
am new thanks good ah so this here is my

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,030
ambient temperature in my apartment the

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,480
red temperature is the temperature of

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:33,620
the water for most people it's kind of

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,960
boring i like it like it i wanted to

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,730
know you know there's just i bought a

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,530
couple sensors on ebay because you know

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,410
the chief of the column i can do that

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:46,310
and the DSA TV twenties are really kind

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:48,260
of cool they're cheap they're easy to

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,700
work with there's Linux drivers

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,730
available you can hook them up to GP

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,010
ioana device can hook up to I think you

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:59,390
even do a parallel port if you still

00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:02,500
have one and resistor and you got it

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:07,250
hard drive or device that registers in

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,770
this class devices w1 something

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,290
something something some but there you

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,960
can get non while you can get a lot of

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,910
different one wire devices that but the

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,360
atv twins are great for data logging of

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:25,990
temperatures click so

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:31,810
as I break things where are the

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,909
temperatures so now what well oops we're

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,950
using device that's online runs linux

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:39,360
and well what can you do with any linux

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,360
computer you can do anything you want

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:49,270
upload the data to kazem if you know

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:51,820
cause Emma's cousin is a logging site

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,810
that you can graph data you can submit

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,839
your temperatures cool one was recently

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,800
with the earthquakes in Japan a lot of

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,600
people were logging radiation data so

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,930
you can see the radiation data at

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,600
someone's house over time and see where

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,320
it rose or went down or still kind of

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,529
cool stuff look it up you synced me some

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,330
pretty cool things with it email

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:24,430
yourself when things are getting too hot

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:27,459
or cold I did script at one point that

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,190
sent me a email and also sent me a text

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:33,089
message with the google SMS google talk

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,110
plugging little pearl that just kind of

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:38,830
shoved it out and send me a text when

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:42,550
things were getting too hot or you can

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:45,279
have to do something about it company

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,500
called ola max little bowl game company

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,470
this parts from digikey they make some

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,459
really cool kind of stuff automatic

00:09:50,470 --> 00:10:02,020
earth this is the mod I 02 this is the

00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:08,520
Mata 01 relays gpio all handily done you

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:11,290
can screw them in and works that's Ron

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,080
they're relatively well built so you can

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:19,300
be not gentle with them they sit on my

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:22,450
floor make great great well-built

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,940
products and supports really good right

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:30,949
now I have one sitting it turns on a fan

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:34,079
and also turns on the next slide

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:36,239
yeah one time to get sooo hot it you

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,819
know 27 degrees i can flip the fan on it

00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:45,540
cools off my fish tank and my fish don't

00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:48,509
die from that also since well you have

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,379
your Paul your pet stuff is in one place

00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:53,489
I have a pet feeder thought it was a

00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,139
great idea when I first got it because

00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:58,350
well it was my on vacation for like a

00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,350
look at week and I wanted my cats to

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,439
have food and well I got that thing and

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,629
it was alright it worked for a while and

00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:11,459
then said her more than it fed my cats

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:14,189
there's 50 bucks it wasn't too much out

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,709
of it but hey it had the electorate do

00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:19,019
attract sucked but the parts actually

00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,239
worked relatively well so I kind of

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:26,059
ripped him out they kind of went to the

00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:31,919
trash and my cats are fed by a cron job

00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:33,899
yeah it's a the motto is just an I

00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,350
squared C device a little i squared c

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,839
program that writes out turn on that

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,879
relay turn off wait 60 seconds while it

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,399
takes to chug through and then turn it

00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,649
off and then clear and then well my cat

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,319
actually responds to nom nom nom which

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:58,679
we taught her in it's adorable but yeah

00:11:49,319 --> 00:12:02,730
that's kind of that all right so with

00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:05,939
any project you have lots of room for

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,350
improvement you never finish things and

00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:13,410
my wife is one of those people that

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:15,239
bless you my wife loves me for it and

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,249
also hates me for it the net things are

00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:22,350
never together and there's always a pile

00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:24,449
of wires I found you have a wife that is

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,660
actually relatively happy with me okay

00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:30,179
this um there are more ideas to this

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,289
because I have all this power to do

00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:37,230
things and I can't you know I have ideas

00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:39,029
and kind of time mood lighting I mean

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,299
you turn your fish tank off at night you

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,190
you if it's the moon's out you usually

00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,100
like in the

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,080
you know pretty waves and pretty blue

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,230
lights at flickr and stuff I want to do

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,910
that fish feeder I want to be able to

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,560
feed my fish as well as my cats I don't

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,120
think that's like for my cats like fish

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,400
food or my fish like cat food but hey

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,920
more realize which the new I just got

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,120
that I that one that's floating around I

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,490
just got that a couple days ago and i'm

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,840
going to do that to turn on the lights

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,010
and the heater for when it gets cold

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:20,270
underwater cam would be kind of cool i'd

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:21,860
like to see my fish um yeah so that's my

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,810
cat it's one of my cats that's the one

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,910
it responds to nom nom nom she's

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,770
adorable next she likes the fish and

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,380
there's tigi on the top and Buttercup on

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:38,060
the bottom who are very friendly and

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:40,640
cuddly and they love me so this is the

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,080
time where I open to questions because

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,700
arm is definitely one of those things

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,430
that people don't know a lot about I

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:52,670
fully accept that and I understand that

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:54,200
so questions who has an art who is a

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,240
project that didn't we're working with

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,240
an Arduino at all you

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,550
mini foot control so what would you do

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,370
this what I would didn't actually go to

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:24,170
your talk wouldn't i didn't go to that

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:26,270
talk mmhmm yeah you take what you you

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,740
have this $30 thing that we're great you

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,930
know a few years ago that were you can

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,580
do all these things with and you find

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,230
that your oh you're kind of limited and

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,209
you're still plugging it into a computer

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,339
you're still working with it like well

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:42,940
cut out the middleman and do it all

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,940
right there you said you had yeah

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:23,650
now it has a the raspberry pi like all

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:27,430
these things have full Linux capability

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:33,160
they have arch linux ARM chips with

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:37,420
pearl in it python python 3 c c++ they

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:40,980
all it all compiles all works great you

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:46,390
have full access your i squared see spi

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,460
gpio the whole gamut of things some of

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,860
the some of the new stuff like the new

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,820
beaglebone black it actually has two

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:59,290
separate controllers on it that can

00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:01,900
actually do are there little eight just

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,350
like 400 megahertz are called PR use

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,220
programmable p lus i don't know but you

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,540
can program them to do things like

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,120
protocol translation like you have some

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,800
weird protocol that you're getting from

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,840
you figured out your your thermostat

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,700
spits out this weird protocol stream

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,640
over one of the pins like oh all i can

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:25,690
figure that out you don't have to tie up

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,060
your cpu by doing i/o weights to you

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,160
know wait for the clocks she just have

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,460
this little chip on it apprehends that

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,780
and today i have data throw it there and

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,780
really kind of cool you

00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:56,160
you can do either compiling on the

00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:58,379
natively on the device has its benefits

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,620
and also drawbacks the biggest drawback

00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:03,140
is speed your arm device is not going to

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,220
be as fast as your desktop computer

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,839
there's no question about you can

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,390
compile a kernel on your computer and

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,740
you know 10 minutes whereas if your

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,039
current pilot Colonel on your Raspberry

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,620
Pi it's going to take a couple hours so

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,980
give that cross compiling though can

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,000
sometimes be weird with libraries if

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,679
trying to link something against

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,470
something else the libraries don't match

00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,940
up and it just ends up with being a

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:31,799
total mess so I tend if you have the

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,690
option to start you know if it's a small

00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,450
project just compile it on your device

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:42,240
if it's something big like you're trying

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:46,620
to compile que te you have problems but

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,090
you can do it but I mean I would

00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,480
recommend you know doing a cross compile

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,490
or another option would be a disk CC to

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,710
offload a lot of your compile time and

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,539
do the linking natively on the device

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,860
but offload all your compiles to another

00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:03,950
higher performance computer that answer

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,950
yeah

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:27,000
it would work correct heat management

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,970
stuff like that you can this device here

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,820
was actually sitting on my desk

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:38,070
untouched for 92 days up time I've had

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:42,090
some I had one device that was 402 days

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,350
before i restarted it I mean they get

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,730
great up time because they have you know

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,290
great power management if your long as

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,800
you don't lose power you're going to

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:52,370
stay things have to keep in mind though

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,110
are a lot of these have flash-based

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,110
storage so you're not going to be able

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,700
to write a lot of things to it I of it

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,809
if you're right into an SD card and

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,220
you're logging everything to an SD card

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,840
over and over and over again you're

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,120
going to wear out your rights you're

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,480
right cycles going to go to nothing and

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:14,730
then you're going to end up with a dead

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:18,000
card you won't know it you can also some

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:21,000
some devices have watch dogs on them so

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,220
if they lock up we'll just restart you

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,500
can do read only operating systems for

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:32,280
your route and then just off load your

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:35,280
data somewhere else they'll have us be

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:39,200
so you can actually just I had one of

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,520
these you know it was some other pocket

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,860
little

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,880
like 4G plug plug it in and you have

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,840
access to it wherever whenever but once

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,940
you have a one so you have something

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,270
stable and working as long as you have

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,940
it it works great and actually this

00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:01,060
device here actually has a lithium-ion

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,650
battery connector and charged circuit so

00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,840
as you plug it in it will run for a

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:09,120
couple hours off of a decent lithium-ion

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,120
battery plug in charge back up again

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,860
most most devices have especially the

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,330
stuff that's on the board itself are

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,399
going to be linux device drivers that

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,409
I'm going to have your general i squared

00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,510
see your spi those are all going to be

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:41,429
pretty standard program them is just

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,990
like you would program for any spi or i

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:50,789
squared c device for the mod i owe you

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:53,669
import or your include IOH I think RS or

00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:56,539
i squared ZIH and you just start talking

00:20:53,669 --> 00:21:00,779
to it through the I squared C library

00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:03,779
make sure I juicy dev is a module and

00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:10,200
you can just point it to / dev / i

00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:12,690
squared C dash 0 and go at it other

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,130
random things you can find weird things

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:19,649
on some like the little side processor

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:23,970
on the Beagle bones does have its own

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:26,990
special little programming languages and

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,299
stuff like that that's a little bit more

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,669
intense and difficult but it can be done

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:35,330
it just for image it acts as a piece of

00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,500
memory in your kernel space and say hey

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,210
do something to this and return it

00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:47,130
whatever when it gets done and you can

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:49,649
do it other a lot of the devices or a

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,590
lot of companies are also doing Python

00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:56,299
libraries for your i/o and stuff the

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:59,480
Beagle like the BeagleBone does have a

00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:04,350
PI BBI oh I think it's the package name

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:10,139
for beaglebone io for Python pretty easy

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:11,639
to work with overall yeah did you have

00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:17,389
any projects that you were thinking of

00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:17,389
or yeah

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,070
ok

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,300
so you two it's an Arduino based device

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:44,120
i think i've seen a bunch of those

00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:48,350
before they are not going to move just a

00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,690
your core very still you can do that

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,710
like with that IO board it has the

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:58,010
relays on it to trigger that you can put

00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,770
a web server on it you can do whatever

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,750
you this board here has Wi-Fi on it so

00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:12,530
you have you don't need to run wires to

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:16,730
it I mean you say you have eight zones

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:19,990
currently get on those boards there are

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:25,340
Kaskade obel you just have to reassign a

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,930
unique ID number to it I'm talking about

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,540
the one that I passed I'm talk about

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,860
this one here it's just i squared see

00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,120
you send a command to it and there's a

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,850
button on here that says reset or

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,440
something so you push you push button

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,570
one while powering it on it goes into a

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,240
program mode you say hey I want you to

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:48,980
be this address and you can trigger that

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:52,630
you can also the mod I oh one has some

00:23:48,980 --> 00:24:00,440
gpio the chain use this one has some

00:23:52,630 --> 00:24:01,970
analog in I believe one of these has

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,710
analog inputs you can actually measure

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:09,500
our soils in soil dampness right then in

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,990
there and have it do okay the soil is

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,580
way too dry i'm going to say send you an

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,790
email saying hey I mean the soil is dry

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:20,500
I need to water like okay cool you can

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:22,550
reply to it and say water away and

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:28,240
things you can do more than you can do

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:30,230
with them how do we know anything else I

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,860
don't have any projects that they're

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,860
thinking of doing

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:44,850
you look like you thinking you don't

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,850
think oh okay I don't either sometimes

00:24:47,430 --> 00:25:03,520
sure I'm actually from Delaware um we

00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:04,750
drove drove in this morning I there

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,550
unfortunately actually no good hacker

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,440
spaces near me the closest one that's

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,410
like two hours like an hour and a half

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,720
away which makes for not much fun to

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:18,640
drive I do spend a lot of time with the

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,630
arch linux arm community on IRC in the

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,710
forums so your questions track me down

00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,030
there I do a lot of we do consulting

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,240
like if someone has a question okay I

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,430
want to do this we can say okay well

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,020
good luck have fun or hey I went to this

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,540
well that's pretty easy just need this

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,840
this this this and then time and

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,840
patience

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:08,190
a lot of them are doing a lot more with

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,170
aviom are arguing nose but they're

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,560
switched moving from Arduino Stu the

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:16,110
Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone panda

00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,830
boards things that have a lot of gpio

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,910
and also have a lot of processing power

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,970
it's one of the things that like it the

00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,760
right tool for the job if you know what

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:30,150
you need to do if you need to just

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,740
control a couple things and that's it

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,360
well then the raspberry pi would

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:39,000
probably be perfect for you if you need

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:42,180
to have 20 gpios and eight analog i/o

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,430
analog inputs well the Raspberry Pi is

00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,290
probably not your best bet you probably

00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:51,740
like a BeagleBone then because that

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:55,850
actually has a whole bunch of stuff the

00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:59,400
Olmecs stuff it actually has little

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,440
display touchscreen displays that you

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,840
can put a touchscreen display for say

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:14,850
your water sprinkler you can give a loan

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:17,540
words the board itself is I think 59

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:22,770
euros whatever that ends up being um

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:25,650
displays about another 20 25 euros gpios

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:30,450
or 15 euros so whatever that ends up

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:34,920
being the hollers i'm not sure but in my

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:38,540
opinion third over the top of the

00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,540
Raspberry Pi I think they're worth it

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:45,140
but it likes that right tool for the job

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,140
yeah

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:59,150
you can do that definitely um you can

00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:01,820
either do the hack way of putting servos

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:06,260
on your door and control him that way

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:09,170
which married your wife probably would

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,590
not approve of my wife definitely does

00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:17,780
not would not let me do that as nice as

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:21,950
she is I love you but you can things

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:26,530
like zigbee controls like they have

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:29,390
zigbee locks zigbee power switches the

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,340
x10 home automation stuff that you can

00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,110
find a garage sales you get those and

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,570
the little plugin adapters it just plugs

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:38,920
in there's actually a package called

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:42,700
monad that allows you to talk to all the

00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:46,250
x10 home automation stuff and works

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:50,150
relatively well I've been done any door

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,470
locks but that would be definitely think

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,380
would be feasible if not then you can

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,840
always get a like one of the actual

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,020
pretty dead bolt ones and there's kind

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:05,290
of run wires along the door jambs here

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,290
it's pretty and then go that route

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:20,980
hmm yeah um you can easily handle it we

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,750
can handle a lot more than that you can

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,090
put a Wi-Fi adapter on there so you can

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,810
check the lock status of your doors you

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:30,670
can unlock you can use your cell phone

00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,100
to unlock it if you want then you can

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,480
just you know go to website login hit

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:39,850
button hey I'm home unlock or if you

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,540
really not fun you could have it ping

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,840
your router say hey is this is this MAC

00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,930
address connected to my router if it is

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,920
but its newly registered let's unlock

00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,920
the door because he's coming home

00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,450
yeah it's only going to be there when

00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:14,070
you're there unless you forget your

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:15,870
phone I'm not saying it's the safest

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,279
thing in the world but it's something

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,460
you could very easily do things like

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,460
that

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,590
how BIG's your wallet there's your I

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,129
mean that's going to be your biggest

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,299
thing um money is all and money is

00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:45,549
always the big things you always end up

00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,320
with thinking oh I can do that you know

00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:49,259
fifty bucks for that and that maybe

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,220
another ten bucks for those other cars

00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,820
some of these things and you don't

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,100
realize oh I need that too and that oh

00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:02,049
now wonder that oh and then you end up

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,429
with triple your original plan and but

00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:11,649
yeah you can do a lot of things you can

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:12,940
do the xB wireless modules they have GPA

00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:15,580
on there that you can talk to back and

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:20,529
forth and then just use your res reply

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:23,440
or bo bone as a home base you can really

00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:26,109
do and it's it's a computer it's just

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,450
not as powerful and does use it as much

00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:32,549
power so anything you could do with a

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,549
regular linux computer you can do here

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:55,029
well I i also have has anyone done who's

00:31:50,139 --> 00:32:00,119
done stuff with an arduino before you

00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:00,119
you what have you done yeah

00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,360
hands down it's ten times faster ten

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,169
times easier to deal with you know

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,530
raspberry pi or else actually a friend

00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:59,710
who actually works for an ERP company

00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:02,980
that is actually working on erp controls

00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,270
in the run on an arm-based device so we

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,270
can control the entire like industrial

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:09,400
automation stuff so I can go here I want

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:12,100
to shut down this factory line from this

00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,150
little control panel and goes through

00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,150
and does it all

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,650
they can't see it they can't see what

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,100
they do immediately like with a

00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:48,630
raspberry pi you have a screen you have

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,880
a keyboard you have a mouse you can

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,890
actually put a GUI on it that allows you

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,210
to work on it and say okay well that

00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,380
didn't work instead of having to unplug

00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,120
it plug it back in your computer where

00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,150
you compile reupload it re plug it back

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,669
in you just change it enter oh now

00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,900
worked and I can see things right away

00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,900
versus though

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:29,129
everything is we're in a love-hate

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,470
relationship with raspberry Pi the

00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:34,799
raspberry pi is not the best hardware in

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:37,290
the world but they got the marketing

00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:40,649
right they got the price point for the

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,720
chip right they brought it to the masses

00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:44,879
properly and they were expecting to sell

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,960
like ten thousand units but they've

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,319
actually sold a million and going you

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,149
can't you can't buy that so it's so it's

00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:56,849
bringing more people into you know if

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:59,520
you would have thought you know for four

00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,400
years ago you would like arm I have one

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,349
of these but I don't know that because

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:12,119
you don't think but it's brought it to

00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:15,440
so much publicity they needs incredible

00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:19,470
I never thought that we'd have you know

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,150
thousands of users you know on a little

00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:24,839
tiny thing that started off with just a

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:31,619
couple and it just has taken off in the

00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:34,049
past couple years and amazing would be

00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,619
done with Arduino what have you done

00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,619
with an Arduino

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:49,299
you just want to monitor that kind of

00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,299
stuff for your garden or

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,510
I do believe I've seen those

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:23,680
who do the via the freescale imx6 quad

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:28,460
with the ad mega chip on it as well

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,100
that's kind of like the tinkerers

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,370
dreamboard I think because it actually

00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,230
gives you the capability of an arm it a

00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:39,230
full computer as well as all the

00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:45,050
capability of an Arduino with it's easy

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:51,140
to program capabilities what's that yeah

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:53,000
has it been funded yet yeah it's

00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,210
actually I've looked into it I've got

00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:03,020
thought it's really kind of cool there

00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:04,490
are cheaper alternatives there is the pc

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:07,550
do we know which is an all winter a 10

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:10,400
based that has the same kind of pin outs

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,230
that aren't quite pin compatible with

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,320
all the shields and stuff but it works

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:21,430
with a lot of them you can get for like

00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:26,200
45 bucks it's 512 kicker ram gigabit or

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:31,220
100 megabit Ethernet you just be hdmi oh

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,870
yeah um yeah who do it would probably be

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,960
very good for what you're looking at

00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:39,680
this actually has a lot of capability in

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,870
that case allow you to take all your

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,800
information and process right then and

00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:47,240
there throw it errors you know do

00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,850
actually data analysis right then and

00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,310
there versus having to lug within

00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,900
Arduino take it out copy it over there

00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,330
oh ok I'm doing this wrong now and go

00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,020
back and fix it whereas it can alert you

00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:04,300
real-time like hey something's wrong or

00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,300
hey this is working right cool

00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,840
who else any ideas yeah

00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,950
the bigger bomb

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,700
you

00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:43,900
so Bitcoin mining on ARM processors know

00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:47,790
the best way to get is some arm

00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:52,540
processors have a fpga on board as well

00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:54,550
that you can hand off a job too there's

00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,460
the parallel ax which has all those I

00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:01,990
think it's a little dual-core 1

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:06,030
gigahertz arm xilinx or zinc processor

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:08,800
and then has these all these little 64

00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:11,260
64 like single core processors on which

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,580
can do all kinds of things but I've not

00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,260
really looked into it too much but

00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,820
you're not going to get too much Bitcoin

00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,320
mining on anything that's low powered

00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,170
unless you heavily design something

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:29,320
specific like I think a year two ago

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:32,730
someone do it did that fpga board ASIC

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:37,210
yeah yeah you're not going to get a

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:39,220
performance I mean bitcoins are designed

00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,870
to be difficult to make because they

00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:44,440
need to be difficult to make if they're

00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,730
going to be something you can chunk out

00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:53,020
a bunch of them all once they're going

00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:58,930
to be kind of useless so you can dream

00:39:53,020 --> 00:40:01,420
actually you probably could wire a ati

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,160
graphics card to pci express poured on

00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:09,660
some of these arm based devices and go

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:09,660
that route but yeah

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,610
you think okay well if i can do it on

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:19,590
the raspberry you're not going to get

00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,190
anywhere close to the performance that

00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,190
you need to do that

00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,890
it depends on it depends on the

00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:48,440
distribution you use raspbian comes with

00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:51,119
some stuff built in already I think the

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,670
occidental is from Adafruit has a bunch

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,509
of stuff built in like a a web IDE I

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:59,910
believe Arch Linux arm has pretty much

00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:03,119
the base install and ssh and then you

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,940
can do whatever you want I probably

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:11,339
avoid running Apache on them because the

00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:16,190
patch is kind of heavy what's that maybe

00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:19,980
I engine X and light HTV work great I

00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:22,819
had one running for months or for a

00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:26,849
couple years actually with engine X and

00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:28,829
php-fpm handling you know some database

00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:31,920
backend stuff as long as there wasn't

00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:37,079
too much load it can handle a lot of

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:45,200
stuff don't expect a like your you host

00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:49,200
your own blog don't expect it to be yeah

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,470
you can do that actually uh I recently

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,779
saw some Python project that had the web

00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,460
server was actually done in Python and

00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:58,349
actually trigger it triggered the gpios

00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,140
and stuff in that from that program

00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:04,019
itself so it actually was all in one

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:08,779
versus having have a PHP back end link

00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:11,779
to trigger something else they can do

00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:15,150
anything you want that you could do in a

00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,470
you know a computer you can do it all

00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,940
right you know a raspberry pi or be

00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:22,940
alone it just won't be as fast or as

00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,940
responsive

00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:45,970
yeah you do have that but once again the

00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:47,710
right tool for the job if your company

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,210
has people that have already done

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,950
something very similar to that in

00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:57,250
another for another machine it doesn't

00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:59,259
from scratch well if there are they

00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:20,019
writing their own software already are

00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:21,579
they writing their own software you see

00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:24,160
that a lot of industrial automation is

00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:29,319
you'll see a lot of stuff moving to more

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:32,109
simple platforms like arm MIPS some

00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,529
powerpc you know small low-power

00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:38,500
computing because they don't need it

00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:40,900
some places you'll I'm one piece of rice

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,019
you start seeing Android in some of

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:49,740
those because programming for android is

00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:52,720
really easy you can hook up a you know

00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,609
gpios to that you write a program in

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:59,109
Java that starts up automatically and if

00:44:54,609 --> 00:45:01,450
it crashes just restarts and you can it

00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:04,839
gets anyone that's graduating college

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:07,750
now to do that for you for a simple one

00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:10,089
but if you need to write something more

00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:13,539
complex and completely by yourself and

00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:14,980
the person you have that does it is a

00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:17,740
windows program that's been doing this

00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,059
for years it makes sense to stick with

00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:24,210
what they know I mean you really can't

00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:24,210
you can

00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,570
you can push them to do you can suggest

00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:40,120
things but you can't push him to do

00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:53,320
anything else I'm a vast knowledge of

00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:58,930
things I always have a question no just

00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:03,160
having inquisitive face oh okay like can

00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:07,410
you attend to my aesthetic there like

00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,940
I've done all kinds of things I have a

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,400
when I go away from vacation I actually

00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,020
take a bunch of arm-based devices stream

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,410
through my apartment with wireless cards

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:22,870
in them and webcams and I actually have

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:24,580
a cat cam because I like my cats I mean

00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:27,670
it's simple things like that you can do

00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,770
these you know you want to watch your

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,350
cat while you're gone throw up a webcam

00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:35,470
and go and it uses 3 watts of

00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:38,350
electricity at all times and never Peaks

00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:40,710
above that you're going to sit there and

00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:44,770
it's a like two dollars a month if that

00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:46,390
whereas you hook up a old pentium server

00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,090
that your old pentium you that you had

00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,380
that's going to cost you know 25 30

00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:55,720
bucks a month just to sit in the closet

00:46:50,380 --> 00:47:01,750
and turn into the same exact thing see

00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:02,980
what about what else I've done I've you

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,560
know

00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:09,110
logging information like for the fish

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,130
tank matter it's one of the one that

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,370
actually sits there actually doesn't

00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,960
record the data it's actually just going

00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,760
through a sequel query it and it

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:21,740
supports no database between extract out

00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:26,810
of its it's amazing what you can do with

00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:31,160
such little things oh my god I never

00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:34,850
thought that yeah that'd be so easy to

00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:37,400
interact with these things it's kind of

00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:40,940
I guess the best way to think of it is

00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,430
you used to have this you know back in

00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,110
the 80s and early 90s you could actually

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:48,080
go inside a computer you could you know

00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:49,070
hook into the ISA bus and pull data

00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,500
directly off of that and actually

00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,360
interface with things nowadays you can't

00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,430
do anything close to that the best you

00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,190
have is plugging Arduino into the USB

00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,170
port and going patro but these you

00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:03,770
actually have access to the i/o you have

00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:06,560
access to the SPI I squirt see and you

00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:09,500
can do it um it's not a huge learning

00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:14,420
curve like if you want it to program for

00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:16,910
you know I seven right now I don't even

00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:20,990
want to think about that it's insane but

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:23,480
program for these the low level stuff is

00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,190
there you just import it you look at

00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,330
other things like oh I want to do that

00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,330
you do it

00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:40,979
yeah what's up

00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:55,350
um actually you can a lot of the higher

00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:58,680
end ones now are zigbee or XB or expert

00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:01,920
a z-wave or one of those protocols that

00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,780
actually can talk to a base station and

00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,920
you can check the status of anything in

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:10,710
there if you have an older system you

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,470
can and you don't want to pay you know

00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:15,120
ADT you know the thirty-five dollars a

00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:17,340
month or whatever you can actually just

00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:22,050
rip this control panel off and use all

00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:24,510
the sensors that they have because my

00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:27,570
apartment they offer a the ability to

00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:31,110
have their security system and if you

00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:32,970
know it's 30 bucks a month wing I don't

00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,320
really need it but if I wanted to I

00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,920
could actually all the wires are there I

00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,750
can just go from here to there and

00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,760
magnet sensors are there that motion

00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:50,580
detectors there was an interface those

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:52,620
directly but I not know anyone that's

00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,670
actually done that saved be integration

00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,670
to kind of cool

00:49:56,859 --> 00:50:04,460
um actually that was one of my projects

00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:09,920
I was working on because I wanted to be

00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:12,859
able to know when my thermostat was on

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:17,060
when it was off because you don't know

00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:18,770
these things actually the easiest way in

00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:31,630
my opinions do that to actually just

00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:34,790
monitor is statistics Beck all right so

00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,170
you have all these peaks and these are

00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:38,540
all drops when my air conditioning turns

00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:40,910
on turns off turns on turns off turns on

00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,010
you can actually just see how often my

00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:46,010
air conditioner comes on when it was and

00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,660
you can go that route if you want to ask

00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:50,570
control its you actually you have to go

00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:55,300
through and do that but I was more

00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:57,290
afraid of freezing if I broke something

00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:03,230
because I have a tendency to do that

00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:05,060
sometimes um yeah I think my wife would

00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:08,080
be friggin unhappy of thought she woke

00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,080
up and was 40 degrees in the house

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:23,510
what's that yes there are actually

00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:25,339
several options with that your best

00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:30,220
option would be to go with a commercial

00:51:25,339 --> 00:51:30,220
product that has the interface to do it

00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:37,940
but I mean it's as simple as a relay and

00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:41,890
a temperature sensor and controlling it

00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:44,390
but that's one of those things that I

00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:52,250
that I wouldn't mess with my brakes in

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:53,420
my car bungee cords like I want to enjoy

00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,859
measure the tension a bungee cord back

00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:59,809
wouldn't some in the middle of it would

00:51:54,859 --> 00:52:02,960
be the brightest idea but yeah make sure

00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:04,910
that you just know what you can do and

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,020
how long it's going to take before you

00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,369
undertake these things good here you

00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,849
know if you want to do a thermostat

00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:13,160
project you know plan out what you need

00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:15,680
how much does it cost if it's going to

00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,670
take a month to fully implement make

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,730
sure that that month isn't going to be

00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:25,220
like freezing like do it in spring or

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:29,770
fall so you're not if something breaks

00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:32,950
you're not going to be in the doghouse

00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,390
yeah make sure you know these things

00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:38,319
make sure that you the people that's

00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:43,760
going to affect also will appreciate it

00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:46,119
because if you break things they don't

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,119
like it

00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,050
yeah home automation can is one of the

00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:57,460
things that can be definitely a trick

00:52:54,050 --> 00:53:00,230
that can be like hey honey I can do this

00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,420
it'll only cost extra dollars oh that's

00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:06,589
kind of cool well we could check on the

00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,589
cats like really like yes so things that

00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:13,400
allow you to that as it's a finding the

00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:27,950
ways to spin these things to get them in

00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:32,320
the proper place questions roughly about

00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:35,270
time well I would like to thank you um

00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:38,960
if you have any questions where we have

00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:40,310
a table over yonder in a back corner we

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,000
have a lot of stuff sitting out that you

00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:46,730
can pick up play with you know ask more

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,310
questions if you I'm more than willing

00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:53,650
to talk to you about any ideas that you

00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:56,780
have if they're feasible not feasible

00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:59,500
I've been pretty good at picking helping

00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:02,920
people pick the right tool for the job

00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,920
but thank you very much

00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:39,240
most enterprises today realize that

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,890
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,260
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,330
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,369
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,500
popular lately that adds that extra

00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:52,170
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,940
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,130
know is that some two-factor

00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,350
authentication solutions they're better

00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:01,380
than others like to factor strong

00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:03,660
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,609
beyond other authentication systems by

00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:08,910
being less expensive easier to implement

00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:11,160
and easier to use getting software based

00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,010
token clients built to run on all major

00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,609
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,930
Android these tokens utilize a

00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:21,359
public/private key combination that's

00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:23,310
generated on device so there aren't any

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,830
shared secrets flying around for

00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:28,680
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:30,540
special handling instead all keys are

00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,030
kept secure and private between the

00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,190
requesting token and your server which

00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,830
you control in-house making it the most

00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,510
secure way possible to perform

00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:42,300
authentication encryption and with an

00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:45,090
extensive flexible API and support for

00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,070
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,250
works with any enterprise network

00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,950
architecture to protect the IT

00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,560

regardless of whether you're considering

00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,120
two-factor authentication for the first

00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,360
time or just ready to ditch your

00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:04,760
existing expensive key file system we

00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:09,700
can help with easy to implement easy to

00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,700
use strong authentication from wicked

00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:20,780
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,970
way to better utilize all your resources

00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,420
and it makes managing all your resources

00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:30,250
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:33,770
happening in open source the

00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:35,570
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,490
of the community and the speed at which

00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:39,650
these are these you know these

00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:41,960
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:44,810
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,810
that really shows the power of the of

00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:50,290
the open source community it is global

00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:53,810
and it's definitely because of the users

00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:59,450
community people are extremely friendly

00:56:53,810 --> 00:57:01,370
and they're always ready to help if you

00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:03,620
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:05,350
guys helping each other out and they're

00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:08,060
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:11,050
the product is transparent for everyone

00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:14,240
everyone can look at the code base

00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:16,480
everyone can see how close that is being

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:21,980
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:24,620
everything is open in many ways it's

00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:29,060
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:33,260
health I'll stack the most exciting

00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:36,090
event in recent memory for me was our

00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:38,760
first developer boot camp

00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:41,400
and our call gave people a gave me two

00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:45,360
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:49,530
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:52,380
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,900
chairs in the room twice everything

00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:58,140
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:01,230
is open source and so I don't think that

00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,970
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:06,000
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:08,550
computing and so i think it's i think

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,080
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,190
about cloud computing you're really

00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:16,740
talking about open source cloud

00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:19,770
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,900
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:26,190
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:28,860
in each data centers these hardware is

00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:32,340
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:35,040
to handle number one that mass scale

00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:38,220
number two it's designed to handle the

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,500
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:43,320
deployments we started working on

00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,830
college attack over four years ago and

00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:49,410
it was the original set of people

00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:51,600
working on it had a background of

00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:55,410
delivering software telcos and service

00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:59,850
providers lots of QA lots of users

00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:03,890
actually using it high availability is a

00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:06,810
key feature multiple hypervisors support

00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:09,240
different network models you can pick up

00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:11,250
whatever suits you better while step

00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:14,910
management server can be deployed in

00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:16,710
different physical machines it

00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:18,330
definitely has a huge footprint it's

00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:23,730
being deployed everywhere there's a

00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:25,470
major movie studio that they were using

00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:28,590
cloudstack they were using it to

00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:30,870
transcode video and i thought that was

00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:32,160
terribly fascinating what i found more

00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:35,430
fascinating is what they did during

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,220
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:39,600
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,050
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,130
the instances and

00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:46,570
doing real work CloudStack is vast it

00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:48,100
touches so many different aspects and

00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:50,320
there's no one person that's kind of

00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:53,800
like a master of all those realms I

00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:56,470
think cloudstack as a project is going

00:59:53,800 --> 01:00:00,270
to be one of the leaders simply because

00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:06,910
it's some of the most feature fallen and

01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:10,170
and robust platforms out they were Adam

01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:10,170
senior living through the clouds dag

01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,030
you

01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,440
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:35,390
ago we could not have imagined that

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,580
asterisk would not only become the most

01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:39,740
widely adopted open source communication

01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,780
software on the planet but that it would

01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:44,300
impact the entire industry in the way

01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,250
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,890
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:50,870
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,970
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:54,350
transition of power from the hands of

01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,630
the traditional proprietary phone

01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:59,030
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,950
administrators of phone systems using

01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,180
this power our customers have created

01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,130
all sorts of business changing

01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,990
applications from small office phone

01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,480
systems to mission-critical call centres

01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,100
to international carrier networks in

01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,900
fact there's even an entire country

01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,270
those communications infrastructure runs

01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,400
on Astra's the gym has always been about

01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,140
creating technology that expands

01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,300
communications capabilities in ways that

01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,500
we could never have imagined and that's

01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,870
part of what's game-changing about

01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,570
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:28,670
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,800
IP phones that extends control of the

01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,540
user all the way to the desktop the

01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,250
launch of these new products represents

01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,350
the next phase indigenous history of

01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,750
innovation these are the first and only

01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:40,100
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,780
power of esther's when we first

01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,010
discussed our expectations for building

01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,900
a family of phones for use with

01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,120
asterisks our requirements were pretty

01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,470
simple we asked the team to build the

01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,780
phones such that they were easy to

01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:52,970
install integrate provision and use I

01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:55,040
think you'll soon agree our engineers

01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,840
have delivered on that goal user

01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,460
feedback is validating that when it

01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,890
comes to operation with astro space

01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,840
systems including our own Switchvox

01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:05,510
based product these are the easiest to

01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,850
use best integrated most interoperable

01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:09,530
products on the market today the Digium

01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:11,960
family of phones will initially include

01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:14,180
three IP desk phones uniquely designed

01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,040
to complement any asterisk or Switchvox

01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,140
based solution these phones are

01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,330
different for a number of reasons first

01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,610
there is clue sively designed for use

01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:24,230
with asterisks secondly we've made it

01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:26,690
really easy to autodiscover and

01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:27,800
provision the phones next we've made it

01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:30,320
easy for the phones to access

01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,950
information inside of asterisks allowing

01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,070
tight couple

01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:35,060
between an application and the phone

01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:37,220
additionally we've created an

01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,320
applications engine that allows users

01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:42,560
and developers to create and run their

01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,329
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,280
done all of this at a very compelling

01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:47,960
price point at Digium we're always

01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:50,060
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,579
the best value in business phone systems

01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:54,200
and also give them the power to create

01:02:52,579 --> 01:02:56,329
their own solutions or any

01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,070
communications challenge well continue

01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:59,510
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,520
Astra's cooler bastard more

01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:03,170
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,630
asterisk and what communications even

01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:09,339
easier and together we'll change the way

01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:09,339
the world communication again

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,910
your customers rely on your website or

01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,310
application if it's slower

01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:26,250
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:28,050
and costs you money keeping your

01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:31,569
business critical systems humming along

01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:33,880
requires insight into what they're doing

01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:35,829
your system metrics tells stories

01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,839
stories that can reveal performance

01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:40,180
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:41,739
other problems but how do you keep an

01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,410
eye on all of your systems performance

01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:47,410
metrics in real-time and record this

01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:49,180
data for later analysis enter longview

01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:51,190
the new way to see what's really going

01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:53,349
on under the hood the long view

01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:55,420
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:57,880
of all your systems providing you with a

01:03:55,420 --> 01:04:01,239
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,819
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:05,589
load and network usage click a specific

01:04:03,819 --> 01:04:07,989
system to access its individual

01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:10,499
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:04:07,989 --> 01:04:12,910
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:14,589
comprehensive network data including

01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:16,900
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:18,459
available on the network tab and disk

01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,380
rights and free space on the disk

01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:23,229
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:25,749
displays usage statistics for individual

01:04:23,229 --> 01:04:27,940
processes the system info tab shows

01:04:25,749 --> 01:04:30,160
listening services active connections

01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:32,319
and available updates adding long view

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,999
to a system is easy just click the

01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,160
button copy the one line installation

01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:38,589
command then run the command on your

01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,299
linux system to complete the process the

01:04:38,589 --> 01:04:42,489
agent will begin collecting data and

01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:44,310
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:46,890
start rolling

01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:49,260
use longview to gain visibility into

01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:53,000
your servers so when your website or app

01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,000
heats up it stays up

01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,619
