00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:47,170
it's that good are we good in the back I

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,950

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,750
Hungarian so I speak with my hands a lot

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,060
I want to thank you folks for coming out

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,009
I know there was some partying last

00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,219
night and it's early in the morning I

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,709
spoke itself I guess a two years ago and

00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,359
I had the nine a.m. sunday slot we

00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:07,709
started at nine thirty because there was

00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,970
no I was the only person up at 9am so

00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,640
anyway I've got this this talk today I

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,290
call it no apple or how I learned to

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,860
start worrying and love the Linux

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,019
desktop I am very happy to see that

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,099
there's very few glowing fruit in the

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:28,989
front row here and I'm basically to talk

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:32,200
about my experiences in going from being

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:35,590
an apple fanboy to actually using linux

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,730
and foss every single day for everything

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:42,790
i used to use apple for now so here's

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,700
some speaker tips first of all let's

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,170
thank the southeast linux fest people we

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,260
gave ourselves a hand let's give them a

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,260
hand

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,480
I put on a very small conference every

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,099
year for opennms which is we have 30

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,450
people it's actually a record we have 30

00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,030
people showing up for a developer's

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,550
conference and it's a pain for 30 people

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,040
they have considerably more people

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,349
showing up for this thing and it really

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,930
warms my heart when I started doing open

00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,400
source full-time in 2001 the only

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,200
conferences you saw were like Linux

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,180
world and you'd go in there big

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,519
corporate conferences I went to the last

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,470
Linux world and there were probably 300

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,260
people there it was a ghost town it was

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,870
depressing because these conferences

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,819
these user conferences grassroots

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,849
conferences are so much better and so

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:36,010
much more successful that it takes a lot

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:39,360
of work now I'm going to start off with

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:43,000
a story okay a little story to fish

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,290
swimming along and they say an older

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,940
fish coming the other way and the older

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,329
fish kind of nods atoms good morning

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,220
boys how's of water a little fish little

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,660
small fry they kind of not add in and

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,819
they keep swimming in as soon as the big

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,840
fish is out of earshot one fish trans

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,850
daily fee because what the heck's water

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,340
now stole that story I stole that story

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,139
from a commencement speech by the author

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,000
David Foster Wallace and his point was

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:13,720
sometimes we are so surrounded by things

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,160
we forget they're there and what I want

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,789
you to take away from this presentation

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,120
is that every day you make choices on

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:24,160
what technology use and how you create

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,350
your information and how you share your

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,060
information and quite frequently get

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,370
into these patterns we don't even

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,789
realize you're making these decisions

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,740
and that was the way it was when i was

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,150
using apple products i just used apple

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,389
products if i needed something i went

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,400
and got the apple version and i got in

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,110
this right and i think it's a bit of a

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,970
dangerous rut I mean you guys have taken

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,220
the first step you made the choice to be

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,530
here now granted Charlotte weather isn't

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,090
exactly beautiful this time but it's

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,639
great you made a choice to be here get

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,860
up this morning and come learn about

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,450
linux and open source software so that's

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,810
great now the thing there's a few other

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,960
things okay I'm an apple fanboy where

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,440
was this is a picture from the cult of

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,070
mac website

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,600
a few years ago I actually rescued an

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,820
original mac that was going to the

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,320
dumpster got it on the internet stuff

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,000
like that because my first computer was

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,640
a trs-80 model one so we probably have

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,970
is 1978 I got it for Christmas I was

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,990
like yeah I model one and then my dad he

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,610
got the the IBM 5150 with the 256k and

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,430
discrete chips soldered to the

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,930
motherboard and he only needed 640k I

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:43,190
mean 256 wow that's halfway there um I

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:45,950
got 64 gig in my phone you know the so

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,780
when I got first exposed to Apple i

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,970
guess around 86 a friend of mine bought

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,450
he was in college he bought a mac plus

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,890
and i loved it and so I started open

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,410
when I started working an open source in

00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,690
2001 I didn't really start making money

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,580
into about 2003 and I said I've been

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,970
working for two years really hard I

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,190
deserve a cool laptop so went to the lug

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,840
the trial ugh is my home lug and

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,210
everyone was buying these things for

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,070
power books and so I started looking

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,190
into him I said I'm going to get me a

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,290
powerbook and so my first modern Mac was

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,610
when the 12 inch powerbook came up so

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,630
how many people here show of hands own

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,270
an apple product so macbook ipod ipod

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,640
phone whatever they are okay keep your

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,970
hands up if you use a macbook as your

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:37,220
primary laptop now keep your hands up if

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:39,140
you use OS 10 on that macbook okay so we

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,790
have a fairly large number of hands here

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,500
you know weird an open source conference

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,990
you're obviously have some interest in

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,419
free and open source software and yet we

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,340
have a large number of people using this

00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,400
very proprietary hardware and software

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,900
and I did it to you know I'm like oh wow

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,630
and so I pulled out what I call my

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,250
credit cards and credit cards in a well

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,680
of course I can use those 10 it's based

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,290
on Darwin and Darwin's freebsd so it's

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,540
open right right it's open and i like

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,930
that you know and i can use open source

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,090
on it one of my guys is a maintainer of

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,790
the feet project so i can install all

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,860
this good new linux goodness on my Mac

00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,330
so that's kind of cool to write I've got

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,699
my

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,909
credit cards and finally I can always

00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:25,030
switch later right so I can only switch

00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:27,419
later that's not a problem so what

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,509
happened to make me change this happened

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:33,009
this is a building in Budapest Hungary

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,780
one of the perks well one of the

00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,909
downsides is my of my job as I travel a

00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,710
lot but the perks is I get lots of

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,349
frequent flyer miles and lots of hotel

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,960
points so every year my wife and I take

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,550
a fairly elaborate vacation and two

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,319
years ago we decided we were going to

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,629
take our Eastern European tour so we

00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,039
went to Dresden and I had really as an

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,500
American if you're ever in Dresden you

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,409
really apologize for februari 13 through

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,389
15 1945 it's like oh here's our church

00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:01,629
and but it's a little burnt from the

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,370
fire outside I would do anything and I

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,990
ended up in Budapest and on the Main

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,460
Street in Budapest you see this building

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,849
and it has the word terror it's called

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,009
the house of terror now one of the big

00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,900
perks of my job is that anywhere i go i

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,659
tend to run into at least one person who

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,000
uses open and a mess and so I had dinner

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,440
with this guy named Paul Kish and I was

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,479
telling him i said yeah i saw that

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,490
building downtown that house of terror I

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,889
recognized a tourist trap when I see one

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,560
so I'm not going there and he looked at

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,769
me very seriously and he said you really

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,979
need to go there this building housed

00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:37,899
the secret police under the order of the

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,969
white cross which is basically the Nazi

00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,979
occupation of Hungary and then after

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,079
World War two the Soviets found the

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,899
building so useful they continued the

00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:49,420
process of detaining people in this

00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:51,430
building so when you walk in you're

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,529
greeted by this huge tank it's very

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,110
intimidating you're in a kind of a

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,199
confined space and you see kind of get a

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,910
feeling of what someone might have felt

00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:03,339
had a tank come walking down you know

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,449
come driving down their Street and you

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,519
work your way through the building it's

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:09,339
one part museum one part art exhibition

00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,350
in one part memorial there's little

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,480
niches in the walls and there's phones

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,100
you pick up a phone and you hear these

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,260
voices talking it's in Hungarian and I

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,930
don't speak Hungarian so I've been told

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,060
though that these are conversations that

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,959
were recorded and the people who were

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,819
recorded were detained and so you go and

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,529
you see how the the government

00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,649
controlled

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:33,389
mail and phone communications which were

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,089
the two major communications at the time

00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,709
and you see the the show show trials I

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,870
was desperately looking through the

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:42,509
roles of all the bad people to make sure

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,089
there was no baylock's you know since

00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:47,999
like how great no no evil balog judges

00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,439
or evil balog policemen and then finally

00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:52,019
you take this elevator this slow

00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:55,759
elevator right into the basement in this

00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,759
basement they have the cells they used

00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:03,720
sorry I get a little choked up um I mean

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,180
one cell was really narrow and you had

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,439
to stand like this in another cell there

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,329
was maybe three feet tall and they

00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:12,589
filled it with water said to crouch in

00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:14,670
water and you get to this one room and

00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,009
Hungary is struggling because some of

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,410
the people who were on the wrong side of

00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:21,389
this are still around I mean they never

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,740
had a Nuremberg trial and never brought

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,199
these people to justice so there's this

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,819
film and it's these women and they were

00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:30,240
all detained and they're telling about

00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:34,050
this degradation that they had at the

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,250
hands of this one commandant and you

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,629
know it was it was there was some

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,670
physical abuse but mainly was a

00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,139
psychological abuse that they heaped on

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,930
these women then they bring the

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,389
Commandant in and she's this elderly

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,160
woman but immaculately dressed in cofton

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,189
and she's like oh you should be thanking

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,620
me because I was just so nice to you and

00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:54,420
it really affected me and I did find a

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,740
Balog there's a Laszlo Balog who was

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,050
killed in this building they killed six

00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,759
hundred people's building so not to bum

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,220
you out first thing Saturday morning but

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,579
I was like wow look at what a government

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:09,930
was able to do with just phone calls and

00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:11,100
emails now I'm a news junkie but when

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,870
i'm on vacation kind of have a rule i

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,069
don't read my RSS feeds I don't do

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,050
anything so I come back to the United

00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:19,829
States and the first thing that pops up

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,389
is iCloud so Apple is introducing I

00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,399
o'clock so not only do they want you to

00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,279
put your mail and your calendar on the

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,319
cloud then we should put your documents

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,970
in your contacts and your when you meet

00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:32,879
with them and everything I just put it

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,470
in the cloud it's so convenient trust me

00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,720
but we won't do anything bad with it

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,370
it's convenient you should use it and

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,230
I'm picking apple out here but it could

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,690
have been it could have been

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,550
google it could be Facebook anyone who

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,020
wants your information and offers you

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,640
something for free there's usually

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,220
something on the back end they're going

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,720
to use that for the reason I put up

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,480
Apple here is that when you installed

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,270
lion this is what you see it's really

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,600
hard to kind of op at and it's kind of

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,520
default is hey but we really don't have

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,530
anything to worry about right because we

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:10,150
have Congress now this is some of you

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,290
this is a family show so i put the

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,160
Penguins up here but this is a

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:18,850
self-portrait this is a self-portrait of

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,830
Congressman Anthony Weiner you can't

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,460
make stuff like that up you can't write

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,740
that you know so Anthony Weiner is busy

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,540
twit picking compromising pictures of

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,890
himself around the internet you know so

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,690
this is the guy who's going to stop

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:37,450
Apple and Google from doing bad things

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:39,340
right no he doesn't get okay and at this

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,880
point I'm I said look if I'm ever going

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,710
to switch I have to switch now because I

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,930
was so entrenched in the apple ecosystem

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:50,260
with iPhoto and all this other stuff

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,210
that i was going to it unless I did

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,240
something I would never switch so let's

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,940
get rid of that so mission impossible I

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,760
set out as I posited ok I'll of open

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,970
source so I'm going to switch my goal is

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,800
to switch from Apple to free and open

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,490
software and as much as I can hardware

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,730
and I don't want to give up anything I'm

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,160
greedy I liked OS 10 I like the apps i

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,500
got so i'm gonna say can i do this and

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,970
at the end of the presentation i'll let

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,980
you be the judge of whether or not i was

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:26,410
successful so first thing what was I

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,150
using I had a couple of 24 inch imacs I

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,070
used to carry around a laptop and then I

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,600
got kind of bored with that because I

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,220
was always I had to do the laptop drive

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,140
of shame and go back home and get it

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,570
when I forgot it so I bought a couple of

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,870
imax stuck one in the office one at home

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,170
and I used cloudy stuff to keep all that

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,850
stuff st. so I had a couple imax for

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,700
traveling at an 11-inch macbook air

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,850
running snow leopard i had an iphone 4 i

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,680
used an airport extreme at home I had

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,940
lots of little Airport expresses so that

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,610
I could stream music around

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,610
the house and i also have a mac mini

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,920
running I TV it's a DVR software so my

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,750
DVR was based on that so I set out

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,050
saying this is what I want to replace

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:10,150
can I do it now the first thing if you

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,420
embark in this mission the first thing

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,920
you need to do well let's get back

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,900
determine what are your critical apps

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,150
what do you use every day I sat down

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,530
basically took had a scratch pad and

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,260
every time I launched an app I wrote it

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,940
down and I didn't do this but you could

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,890
put a little check marks every time you

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,230
launch the app so that you could see

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,920
what you using for me it's male I'm old

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,230
in eighteen seventy eight TRS 80 old I'm

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,840
an email guy i'm not a twitter guy i'm

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,550
not an SMS guy i'm a email guy i

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,410
actually want to put on my resume job

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,390
description I answer and write emails

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,830
because that's literally what I do for a

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,970
living pardon I thought her to comment

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,370
feel free to interrupt me I don't mind

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,040
um calendars real important to me

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,720
because I travel a lot and organizing

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,730
and we're services organizations so

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,620
being able to schedule when and where

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,590
people are is very very important web

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,420
browsing of course office gear things

00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,400
like that i used quickbooks that's what

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,290
i used to run the company so i needed

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,730
that so i wrote down on my list because

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,310
the biggest complaint i tend to hear

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,680
people go is well i just have to have

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,900
this particular piece of software so I

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,060
can't switch from either windows or OS

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,340
10 and that may be true but i might say

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,990
well can you run it in a V how often do

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,150
you use it can you run into vm can you

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,860
switch everything else so for me I had

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,140
to analyze and I'm like okay I bet

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,810
there's applications out there that will

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,420
allow me to do all of these things so

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:39,160
that was my first step I put this up

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,520
here this was not an easy journey I mean

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,110
I've been doing this now for two years I

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,500
guess the last 18 months I've been

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,930
pretty solid open source software but at

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,610
one point I remember I ran screaming to

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,440
the back room grabbed my imac and ran

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,830
back and reinstall said I've got to use

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,240
this so frustration it is I was trying

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,810
to achieve something was running into

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,280
problems part of this presentation is I

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,920
hope you will embark on this quest

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,420
yourself and i'm hoping to give you some

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,040
tips that will help you make

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,120
easier and learn from my mistakes

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,230
because this isn't that kind of what

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,180
open source is all about so if you want

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,540
to try this out on Apple hardware you

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,889
can dual boot your Mac you know so it's

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,750
kind of like dipping your toe in the

00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,720
water you can you can see with what's

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,610
going to happen they're very many ways

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,320
to do this one of the greatest things I

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,899
think Apple ever did was come up with an

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,329
application called time machine think it

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,399
came out around tiger I forget exactly

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,199
when it was but when steve jobs you know

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,110
that one more thing was time mission I'm

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,389
like what backup and restore if you've

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,579
ever used it it's amazing because you

00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,399
can back it up shove an install disk in

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:52,190
and restore everything you can restore

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,079
from one app or one type of hardware to

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,440
another type of hardware I have yet to

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,570
MIT able to find the equivalent in in

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,029
the open source world I do have backup

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,529
solutions that I use but so if you're

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,750
doing this and you're not using time

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:07,429
machine try it because it'll save you

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,870
again some frustration if you run into

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,280
problems and you end up pooching your

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,140
hard disk by what I'm about to tell you

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,689
to do you can always restore from timing

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,429
chain and not worry about it now if you

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,750
only want to run two operating systems

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:21,919
on your on your Mac use bootcamp

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,429
bootcamp is an app that's on your

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,549
utilities it'll allow you to repartition

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,799
your hard disks without having to

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,350
reinstall OS 10 you can just this little

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,240
slider you can move it and say hey give

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,919
me another partition if you use bootcamp

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,080
at the point it asks you to install

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,150
windows just shove in your install disk

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,090
reboot and run it from there because you

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,919
already have a partition you can use

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,280
what I do is I have these training

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,549
machines that I use that we tried the we

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,960
actually run windows ubuntu and OS 10 on

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,400
them and here's some commands these

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,429
slides should be available i sent them

00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,330
to jeremy so they should be up somewhere

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,520
but here's some commands you can

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,500
actually stick to install disk in choose

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,970
utilities launch the terminal

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,140
application and run this from the

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,840
command line and this will partition

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,000
your main hard disk into three

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,480
partitions then you can use those to

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,500
install Linux or anything else you want

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:22,100
now this is a you may not need to do

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,870
this anymore but when I started this

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,860
a lot of operating systems were still

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,330
based on master boot record in MBR

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,250
everything's migrating now to efi and

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,549
there was this this app you could

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,799
download it's no longer maintained as of

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,410
march but it still works fine call ref

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,110
it and what it allows you to do is it

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,340
will add a menu to OS 10 so when you

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,010
boot you'll be able to choose which

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,809
partition to boot I'm not a hundred

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,169
percent sure this is required but since

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:53,860
I haven't had to do it there was a hand

00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:57,190
okay so I'm not sure it was required

00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,590
because a lot of stuff is efi aware now

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,120
but if you do decide to do this I was

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,570
install reffet because it gives me this

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,909
nice little nice little menu here where

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,390
I can just boot to any of my operating

00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:12,980
systems now when you install reffet you

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,450
usually just hit standard install when

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,360
you get to the point what allows you to

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,840
customize it the one option you have is

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,280
to add the Linux file system drivers so

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,530
if you install reffet be sure to check

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,010
the box for the file system driver so it

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,720
will understand the different file

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,610
systems that we're running like a txt it

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,809
says ext2 but it'll understand three and

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:39,710
four as well once you've got ref it

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:41,539
installed you have this option called

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,070
start partitioning tool as soon as

00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:45,260
you've partitioned you disk every time

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,730
you touch the partitioning table run

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,169
this partitioning tool because that

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,520
creates this pseudo NVR record so that

00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,770
the operating systems can do it and once

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,030
you do it reboot because if you don't

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,450
reboot apparently it doesn't take effect

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,210
I found this out the hard way so um once

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,400
you have this going all of your any

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,190
distribution you choose should recognize

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,500
the hard drive in such a way that you

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,730
can boot now Master Boot Record will

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,320
only allow for four primary partitions

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,059
efi takes one of them so there'll be an

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,470
efi partition that you have to leave a

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,750
loan so that leaves you with three

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,100
partitions so if you're using Master

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,309
Boot Record you can only have three

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,440
operating systems now efi I think we'll

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,419
do 256 or maybe theoretically unlimited

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,070
so there's really nothing now this is

00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,760
just the boot partition if you want to

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,110
set up linux with boot VAR home you

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,740
can just make sure that the boot

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:40,420
partition is a primary partition that's

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,760
all extra-credit stuff for most of you

00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,490
but I wanted to throw that out there now

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:50,230
here's a religious question on which

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:52,180
distribution I'm not and I I don't mean

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:56,170
to offend anyone by leaving like arch or

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:58,800
gen 2 or anything off this list but it

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,990
just seemed these are distributions that

00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,560
in some way or another could be used for

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,090
desktops I the arch guys are here this

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,100
weekend so feel free to talk to them

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,200
they will admit that they're more of a

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,090
developer's distribution it's a great

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,960
distribution but again their focus is a

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,580
little different than into user desktops

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,530
debian i put debian on here it's not

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,030
really considered a desktop by most

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,130
people it's not considered a desktop

00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,690
distro i put debian here because it's

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,990
kind of the grandfather of a couple of

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:34,260
these and the debian folks are really

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:37,600
into free annoyingly so at some times um

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,150
like i use i do network management and

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,760
they decided the SNMP mid definitions

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,530
weren't free enough so you actually have

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,450
to install non-free to get your mid

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,960
definitions loaded and it's a bit of a

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,850
pain but i have i have run debian as a

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,550
desktop I'll talk about that briefly on

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:57,640
fedora and Ubuntu are probably the two

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,950
main stream distributions if you look at

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,170
people who commercial software vendors

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,410
that support distributions on Linux they

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,600
tend to target those 2 i'm in i'd live

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,850
near raleigh so i tried fedora because

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,980
that's you know it's the Red Hat desktop

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,880
distribution and redheads just down the

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,750
road I ended up using Ubuntu and i'll

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,700
talk about reasons why in a second

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,290
ubuntu is a fork of Debian this guy

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,850
named Mark Shuttleworth a founder to

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,140
company called fought made a bunch of

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,690
money and decided he was going to do a

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,300
linux distro so i found a company called

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,640
canonical they released do bunt to bunt

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,990
is a fork of Debian when we start

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,520
talking about desktops some people got

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,970
pissed at a bun too so they forked

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,700
Ubuntu and formed linux mint and this is

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,580
the beauty of open source if you don't

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,670
like something you're free to change it

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,050
I also put Susa up here

00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:53,680
if there's a distribution I personally

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:56,380
don't like it susa mainly cuz a yest I

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,000
don't like their packaging system but

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,190
they were one of the first that really

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,470
gave it the old college try about having

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,950
a desktop distribution so I felt it was

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:08,260
only fair to put them up here again

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,930
choice you're swimming in an ocean of

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,370
choice and yeah it requires a little bit

00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,050
of work but I wanted everyone to be

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,170
aware there's a lot of choices out there

00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:19,150
for your distribution's the choices

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,740
don't stop there well first of all okay

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,600
when you start installing this stuff you

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:27,490
might see this screen a nice black

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,200
screen with a little flashing cursor now

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,850
what I love about open source is how

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,290
detailed and wonderful the error

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:38,290
messages are so of course from this you

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,510
can see that um you know what bag is it

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,480
turns out this little thing is usually

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,980
caused by Nvidia graphics cards I don't

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,260
I bet you could get it to happen under

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,090
an ati graphics harder in Intel what I

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,270
found out is there's this little trigger

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,990
in the kernel called no mode set if

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,300
you're installing a distribution

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,500
somewhere else a modify when you're

00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,590
installing it I said you want to modify

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,830
Colonel options put in no mode set equal

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,750
to yes or just no mode set and it will

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,340
get you to the Installer once the

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,310
Installer ones they usually install

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,410
nouveau or proprietary drivers that will

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,090
let it work from their own app but

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,240
getting you over that installation hump

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,800
no mode set is your friend again i hope

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,950
i just saved a bunch of time for

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,540
somebody on that so of course now that

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,520
we've chosen a distro we need to choose

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,890
a desktop of course the Linux desktop is

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,310
dead I read it in the internet so it has

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:33,430
to be true this bothers me this really

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,810
bothers me because my brain shut off

00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,370
when I read this when i hear leanest

00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,380
torvalds talk about how ghanem three

00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,180
sucks my brain shuts off I mean why

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,970
should I goes to 0 I shall leave 0 is 10

00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,760
I think they're both wrong I think what

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,410
they should say it sucks for me because

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,030
again it's choice everyone's different I

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,580
can remember um I worked for this

00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,380
company and guy left and he had a better

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,690
laptop than i had so i asked for it I

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,160
said can I have jim's laptop so i get it

00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,020
open it up this is the windows day so

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,410
this is in the 90s i opened it up and

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,350
he's just conferred with

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,970
icons and I haven't you know i'm a geek

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,910
I think all geeks to some point or a

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,410
little OCD and I like a clean desktop

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,030
you know that's not to do list I put

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,160
things on my desktop and I remove them

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,290
and so seeing this thing and I was you

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,670
know I wanted to show how smart I was so

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,000
I was talking to the IT manager look at

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:22,010
this guy oh it's all cluttered and he

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,640
kind of just sighed and he said yeah

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:30,470
yeah like that you know um so there any

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,540
business said that's why you can

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,250
customize a desktop its choice you

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,050
shouldn't force your opinions there

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,090
isn't a wrong answer as long as you get

00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,590
your job done as I mean now that you're

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,270
incredibly successful at what you do

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,770
with your desktop with all this stuff on

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,900
it you know and you can find things very

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,460
quickly if it works for you that's the

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,290
key point whenever you're making these

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:52,880
technology decisions if it works for you

00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:54,770
is a huge plus in that column now so I

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,270
started exploring so okay you know I'm

00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,550
scared of this house of terror I'm

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,040
growing use a desktop I was trying to

00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,540
figure out what desktop to use you would

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,110
be I have four up here there's easily

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,870
double that in useful commonly used

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,270
desktops I have appeared genome three I

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,640
used genome free for a while when I was

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:16,180
on fedora and on debian i use i

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,270
installed debian wheezy for genome three

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,850
they're beautiful I mean you think about

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,920
and I have to admit again we get set in

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,510
these patterns i was using OS 10 so OS

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,850
10 had to be most beautiful thing on the

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,100
planet i was so beautiful then i had to

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,200
install windows 7 for my wife's job and

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,670
I was like wow that's kind of pretty and

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,910
I start looking at these guys in there

00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,500
gorgeous I liked genome three it was a

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,060
bit of a paradigm shift it was a little

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,800
frustrating at first but what I liked

00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,570
about going on three is it let you do

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,700
what you needed to do and then it got

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,710
out of the way I mean there weren't any

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,660
cascading menus it kind of you know

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,280
stuff just a little launcher bar later

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,690
could go away and you're just looking at

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,960
a blank desktop with your apps on it

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,600
kind of like that another great desktop

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,550
is KDE and que te gets a lot of flack I

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,980
love that they just released what for

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,110
dot 5 and on slashdot it's like all the

00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,980
three KDE users must be very proud you

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:11,520
know but I like que te que te is another

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,410
gorgeous desktop

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,660
the big que te difference is that

00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,030
they're trying for this huge integrated

00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,620
suite of applications so they have their

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:23,130
own mail client their own office suite

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,510
their own browser and the thing that

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,370
bothered me about Katie the most was

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,590
it's so configurable I didn't have the

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:32,850
time to it wasn't easy for me to get it

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:35,310
to where I wanted it to be now ubuntu

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,870
released too much fanfare this thing

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,120
called unity they got probably as much

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,360
flack about unity is gone three got for

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,040
their release I like unity especially

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,200
coming from a Mac because it's analogous

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,270
I mean let's be on a shell worth is

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,370
trying very hard to rip off apple and

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,110
Apple ripped off the rocks and everybody

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,580
out you know so you know is it really

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,080
bad its sharing it's all about sharing

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,610
right um so a bunch of people said we

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,930
don't like what Canonical's doing we

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,980
don't like the direction they're taking

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,830
so we're going to fork it we're going to

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,450
form mint and i believe the i remember

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,850
reading something just recently that

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,070
Nick is the number one desktop now based

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,360
upon some browser history or something

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,270
they said it looks like a lot of people

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,050
who use linux desktops like mint mint is

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:21,180
an ubuntu fork that brings back a

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:23,400
cascading menu kind of operating system

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,840
so you have in the bottom here you have

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,220
your little menus just like you did with

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,680
windows and just like you did with

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:33,930
genome to again play with them you can

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,160
run genome free on ubuntu by default

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,280
install unity but there's nothing

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,130
preventing you in fact there's a cable

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:44,400
kubuntu a derivative where they just

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:47,850
make ubuntu focused on KDE there's an X

00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:52,020
bun to which is xfce another window

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:55,260
manager you have a lot of options but

00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,970
what I want to propose is I chose a

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,340
Bunter with unity and these are the

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,410
reasons why again I was coming from a

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,780
mac environment I really like the fact

00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,240
that I could work on my Mac but I didn't

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,750
have to work on my Mac if you get my

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,480
drift once you get simple support from

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,590
proprietary drivers debian you know if

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,150
you want to install anything that's

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,550
non-free you've got to jump through a

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,450
few little hoops here is just like would

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,010
you like to install these proprietary

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,440
drivers boom you get your wireless

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,310
drivers you get your now the thing we

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,930
all should be doing is buying

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,060
software hardware that has software

00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,890
support for free and open source

00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,120
software drivers but at the time I had

00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,950
already invested in all the glowing

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,460
fruit and I needed to use the bone fruit

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,210
and I needed proprietary drivers in

00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,390
unity there had this thing called the

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,500
launcher it's very analogous to the dock

00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,020
everyone complains because we've been to

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,360
forces it to be on the left where is you

00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,470
can move it around on OS 10 you can't

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,870
put it at the top but you knew right

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,050
right on the left I actually like that

00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:56,580
because his screens become wider

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,460
vertical real estates more important to

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,410
me especially if you're writing code

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,210
then then horizontal so I was already

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:06,120
moving my dog to the left so it wasn't

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,610
for me it was an easy choice shuttle

00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,560
what does remind me of jobs one of the

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,870
failings I think about KDE is they are

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,690
so accommodating for all possible

00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,550
combinations that it makes it hard for

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,400
any one person to get it to where they

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:22,830
needed to be jobs basically said I'm

00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,300
going to tell you what you want and to

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,730
some degree Shuttleworth's the same way

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,440
but the major difference is there's

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,530
nothing Shuttleworth can do that I can't

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:37,980
undo there was a big kerfuffle because

00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:39,330
when it what it was it it was it wasn't

00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,690
pompous pederast it was the one that

00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:44,700
came after that the q1 they he announced

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,380
when you do a search for files it would

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,670
actually go to Amazon and do a search

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,190
and look stuff I everyone's like oh

00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,500
that's horrible and RMS got something he

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,570
goes that's horrible your you've got a

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,490
rootkit here's me and then of course

00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,870
shuttleworth is very if you've ever

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,150
looked at mark shuttleworth he's very

00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,890
politic and very diplomatic so of course

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,050
he said well i already have root I can

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,550
do anything I want which isn't a nun

00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,190
false statement he could have phrased in

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,380
a little differently but um you know

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,450
within you know if canonical does

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,400
anything to bun to within six hours

00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,530
someone has written a package that

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,900
allows me to turn it off so when i

00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,310
install ubuntu i just hit know you know

00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,700
and if i don't like it i can go to mint

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:25,740
i have choice it is one of the most

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,810
popular desktop distros and what

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,780
Shuttleworth has done in creating a

00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:33,180
popular desktop distro is he's given

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,880
proprietary software vendors something

00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,710
to write to I can play steam games now

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,350
natively on

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:43,020
desktop and that's something I couldn't

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,700
do before now the beauty of it is if it

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,140
runs on we bring to someone will find

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,159
out how to run it on mint and someone

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,750
will find out how to runner on fedora

00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,970
and someone will find out but you need

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,000
that toe in the door and that's what a

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:56,789
buncha gives us so i started with

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,580
naughty night nurse and then when

00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,380
onanistic Oliphant came out I was like I

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,020
hate this something about I can't even

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,149
remember what pissed me off but I ran

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,370
and I booted the Debian Iran debian

00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:10,320
wheezy for about six or seven weeks and

00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,120
then that pissed me off so I went to

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,159
fedora and then that pissed me off and

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,320
so I went back to bun too and I kind of

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,500
liked it again I don't know what I know

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,870
it was just me but part of this was

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,730
pompous pederast the LTS version came

00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,190
out and a few the way your bun to does

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,260
releases this may change but they have

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:32,669
been doing every six months so you'll

00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,919
end up with 1004 is April of 2010 and

00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:37,919
into six months later you get 10 10

00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,570
which is October of 2010 etc but every

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,049
so often they come out with a long term

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:46,649
support and this is 12 12 10 is that no

00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:48,710
1204 1204 so April of 2012 for 53 years

00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:51,690
they promised to support this release

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,669
LTS ubuntu LTS is probably one of the

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,299
most stable operating systems i've ever

00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:59,159
used now on my desktop at work i upgrade

00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:01,380
to the latest the desktop at home and on

00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,659
my laptop I stick with LTS and I don't

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,570
like the there's issues they're not

00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,669
nearly as stable but man LTS is rock

00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,140
solid I really really like it there's a

00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,610
Software Center so it's like the App

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,850
Store you can go and you can buy

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,500
proprietary and free software download

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,270
free software through the software

00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,789
center I've used app I tend not to use

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,559
it but it's there in my favorite part is

00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,600
they have these things called ppas these

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,390
are repositories that are very easy to

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,250
install that lets me track a particular

00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:32,220
application or group of applications

00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,080
outside of the bun to like when I talk

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,029
about audio players i use banshees so i

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,059
can actually track banshee and not wait

00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:41,730
for ubuntu to come out with the latest

00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:44,130
release it gives the choice to me very

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,500
very powerful so in this case I was

00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,899
talking with some folks earlier if the

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,950
Linux is gateway drug the latest desktop

00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:53,309
gateway drug is Ubuntu

00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,929
I feel free that if you know and I know

00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,539
this is going to happen canonical will

00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:59,580
piss me off in the next 18 months they

00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:01,980
will and I'll switch to something else I

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,620
may go back and try debian again I might

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,840
go to fedora but I feel confident I can

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,480
do this because I've used ubuntu for 18

00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,879
months and uncomfortable now using open

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,050
source software so I want to just throw

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,349
that out there if you're looking to get

00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,419
started check out ubuntu now here's a

00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,669
ubuntu software center so you can

00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:22,530
download stuff again here's a shot of

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:25,320
here's here's my steam account this was

00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,700
taken on my ubuntu system I don't have

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,889
many games I don't have time but I love

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,480
portal and I've only played like 40

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,669
minutes of it so I'm like because I got

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,070
tired of having to boot into OS 10 or

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:38,280
into windows to play it now I don't have

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,970
to I can play it directly on my desktop

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,859
which is just exciting for me okay so i

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,929
mentioned that mail was my critical app

00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:48,329
so there you get a lot of choices for

00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:51,000
email the genome client is called

00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:54,240
evolution the KDE client is called k

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,440
mail and there is a Mozilla project

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,140
which you're probably familiar with

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,240
called thunderbird I tried them all when

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,599
I was running debian as my desk distro

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,319
for genome three I used evolution but it

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,630
would break so I dutifully go and google

00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,940
the error and it would say all run it in

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:15,119
debug mode so i put it in debug mode and

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,230
then it would work and slower word for a

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,230
couple of days and then it would break

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,050
and and I'd find and granted i was using

00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:24,180
Weezy Weezy was testing you know debian

00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:27,150
is usually rock solid but testing was

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,310
just a little too unstable for me so

00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,800
when I switched a KDE I used kmail I was

00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,810
quite happy with KML the problem i ran

00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,220
into with KDE was they have a thing

00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,800
called contact everything starts with a

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,890
k with a few exceptions but like contact

00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,109
with a k they had these QR codes that

00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,730
were like 800 x 800 pixels there were

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,859
these huge QR codes and you couldn't

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,069
change the font of the actual address

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:51,839
and I'm old and I was having to squint

00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:53,220
and I just dinner to read an address so

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,119
I said okay screw that i'm not going to

00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:59,490
use it i settled on thunderbird I think

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,530
Thunderbird is amazing again you can use

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,910
Thunderbird on OS 10 so if you want to

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,230
get used to it down

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,059
thunderbird and you're able to do

00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:09,299
unified in boxes and all that good stuff

00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,859
that you get with mail app one thing

00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:13,680
that Thunderbird that has support for is

00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:15,960
plugins such as plugins for encrypted

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,420
email one of the things that frustrated

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,559
the heck out of me is that Apple you

00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,630
know no nefarious intentions but they

00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,859
don't make it easy for you to encrypt

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:31,140
your email there's a there's an open gpg

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,930
project that door mat gpg there's a

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,700
project that actually does that but they

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,069
literally have to reverse engineer ever

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,410
email app that comes out so that they

00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:42,089
can say so every time there's an upgrade

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,559
gpg breaks for a couple of days while

00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,260
the guys figure out what they changed

00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,569
with this I install a mail and boom

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,069
I've got built-in PGP and decryption and

00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:52,319
everything like that it's fantastic I

00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:55,319
like the calendaring system this is

00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:56,819
lightning you can do everything you can

00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,530
do it outlook when you get a little hey

00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,930
don't accept this invitation you can put

00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,130
it on the calendar and stuff like that

00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:05,190
very very pleased with thunderbird

00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,260
enlightening now I run an organization

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,549
where we have all different types of

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,279
people we have all different types of

00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:14,460
distros one of the things that I needed

00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:18,240
was some way to synchronize my calendars

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:21,240
and contacts across Android phones ipod

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,500
phones sorry I've watched modern family

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,539
and one guy referred on iphone is an

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,510
ipod phone and i have to keep doing that

00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:29,970
because i think it's funny um and all

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,829
these different desktops OS 10 different

00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:36,329
types of linux well I found this project

00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:39,240
called so go and so go allows you to run

00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,349
your own synchronization server I'm

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,420
going to talk about switching to android

00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:44,039
a little bit later and one of the

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,450
frustrating things I found was the only

00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,309
way I could get the contacts from my

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,490
desktop to my android phone was to use

00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,170
google and i like google google

00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,950
sponsoring the party tonight where I'm

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,359
going to drink free beer on google and

00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,500
you want to get on my side you know I'll

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,920
talk I'll talk good stuff about

00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,319
Microsoft if they buy me free beer but I

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,880
don't want to share my contacts with

00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,470
google and so we found this thing called

00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,700
so go its out of its out of I think it's

00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,319
out of Finland I know it's at one of the

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,960
Norwegian I want Scandinavian countries

00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:14,670
it's rock solid I'm able to it's got a

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,880
web interface I'm able to there's

00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,089
plug-ins for lightning the

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,890
plugins for ical and my entire company

00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:22,180
runs on it now we can set meetings and

00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,640
share it it's really really worth

00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,170
checking out again it's extra credit you

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,869
don't need it to switch but it really

00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,250
really helps me in the fact that I can

00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:32,740
you pull out my phone and know that it's

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,299
current web browsers this is a

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:37,960
no-brainer I don't even this is the

00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:39,430
slide we got web browsers I mean we

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,130
almost all of the popular web browsers

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:44,700
like Chrome and Firefox probably started

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,289
on Linux I don't know if they did I but

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,960
so we've got Firefox we've got Chrome

00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:51,099
this is chromium which is the pure open

00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,069
source version you can still download

00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:56,769
the chrome or Google version conqueror

00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:59,500
is the KDE one you've got opera we we

00:38:56,769 --> 00:39:01,990
have an excess of wonderful browsers now

00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,549
i use firefox i use chrome when i'm

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,700
using google apps which i do use some

00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:08,950
google apps but the thing I like about

00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,839
Firefox now is they have their own

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,059
synchronization server called Firefox

00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:16,240
Sync used to be called we've anyone

00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:18,279
using we've or sink when you get these

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,099
slides just Google how do i setup

00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:22,599
Firefox Sync very very easy they have

00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,460
packet you can just I think you just

00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,099
build it from get you just check it out

00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,230
and run it this allows me to sync all in

00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,990
my bookmarks and passwords and stuff

00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,670
like that on a server I control if

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,809
you're not up for that Firefox will

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,430
allow you to do it on one of their

00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:38,170
servers and it's pretty secure you can

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,900
read about how they set up these keys

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:43,359
that only you get so they can't peek

00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,210
into your passwords but if you want that

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,980
extra level of I own this if you have a

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:53,349
server you can put this on works really

00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:54,819
really well office options we've got k

00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,519
office is the office suite that comes

00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:00,549
with KDE again we had open office which

00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:03,160
was star office back in the day open

00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:06,539
office was purchased or acquired by sun

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:09,009
and when the evil empire took over sun

00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:10,839
bunch of people got pissed and forked it

00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:13,960
and formed libre office which is there

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:16,210
right libre office is the default office

00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,450
that comes with a bun too from what i

00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,220
use office for it is more than enough i

00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,099
can remember back in the mac days i had

00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,609
an 800 k floppy and on it i had the

00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:29,650
operating system laserjet drivers

00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:34,900
mccreight McPake mukhde raw and I'd like

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:36,520
50k left over for files and mccrite did

00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,420
everything with the exception of a spell

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,099
checker because I'm a horrible speller

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,020
with the exception of a spell checker

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:44,770
mccreight did everything I needed to do

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:46,599
and it was 76 k I forget how big

00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,549
Microsoft Word is now but I'm not an

00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,770
online publisher I don't need to publish

00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:53,680
newspapers I just need to publish my

00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:56,170
little letter Libre Office is fine as i

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,670
said i end up doing everything expense

00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,569
reports everything through labor office

00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,029
again this is something you should try

00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:05,829
you can save it as doc and PowerPoint

00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,599
formats so it worked really really well

00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,720
because people still insist on sending

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,690
me docx files and as long as I can open

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,450
them under Libre Office I'm fine really

00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:20,109
really strong their accounting not so

00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:21,460
much so we use QuickBooks I use a

00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:22,809
version that's about five years old

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,069
because again it does everything I

00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:28,990
needed to do I didn't feel a need to

00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:30,579
upgrade there is a new cash from what

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,369
I've looked at it it's a very very

00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:35,260
serious attempt at an accounting project

00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:37,029
it uses true double entry accounting

00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,059
which things like quicken don't

00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:41,380
QuickBooks Doug but quicken doesn't so

00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:43,359
right now I actually have an old Mac

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,420
that all it does is run QuickBooks and I

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,940
use VNC so i can just V&C into it use it

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,309
I could try to get the version for

00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,220
Windows to work under wine line is not

00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:59,799
an emulator but it allows you to run run

00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:01,839
Windows applications under linux is it

00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:05,549
perfect no but maybe it would be perfect

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,549
enough but I just settle down yes sir

00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:11,230
the yo yes yeah but you know I'm sitting

00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,099
here talking about privacy I don't

00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:16,089
really want my stuff up there you know

00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,799
all right right right right right sorry

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:19,660
sorry but then I have to get the windows

00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:22,480
version because OS 10 won't let you

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,220
legally run it in and because they want

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,630
to control everything see that's why

00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,849
that's worse than we about

00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,890
Microsoft as a community and no one

00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,650
 about Apple mainly because we

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,430
can all respect Apple as a technology

00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,430
company in the back

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,609
your transition on the new max that's

00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:56,109
this advice disk image

00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:57,880
aah i didn't know but I'm no longer on

00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:59,829
an apple-branded computer so that would

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,380
be messed up because I went bought the

00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:03,819
day I want I like I vote with my wallet

00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,099
I get really upset when people say you

00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:07,930
should it's like I'm gonna you know when

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,069
I look for hardware I go to people who

00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,230
support linux and I give the money

00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:13,029
because I like doing that and so when

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,589
Del came out with an ubuntu laptop I

00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:15,999
bought it not necessarily because I

00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:17,619
really like the laptop but because I

00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:23,559
wanted to encourage that behavior good

00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:26,380
cookie have a cookie good down graphics

00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,730
editing some people you know dealing

00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,309
with graphics they say I've got to have

00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:33,069
photoshop and okay you have options now

00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:35,259
but guess what Adobe just announced if

00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,730
you want creative suite you can't

00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:38,470
download it anymore you have to use it

00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,640
in the cloud and we're going to charge

00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:44,319
you 20 bucks a month forever to using

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,519
the cloud so if you create think about

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,099
it you're going to create something

00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:55,269
that's for one product that's not the

00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:57,099
sweet cheese well what bothers me is is

00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:58,749
you're creating something which is good

00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,519
you're creating drawings you're creating

00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:02,700
something and then you're locking that

00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:05,380
creation up in this proprietary software

00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,730
that bothers me more than paying for

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,069
software I pay for software other time I

00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,450
by little apps and I give money to open

00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:12,640
source developers if they have a little

00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,650
in a donate via paypal I do that I want

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,039
again here have a cookie to keep doing

00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,480
that more that but the big one is

00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:22,480
so I'm going to talk about these we got

00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,640
 inkscape is 1k Rita is of course

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,890
que des graphic package because que te

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,230
does their own version of everything and

00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,299
then there's also blender is there are

00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,279
people making hollywood movies quality

00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:36,489
hollywood quality movies now using

00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:38,829
blender which is a 3d creation tool it's

00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:41,349
amazing I've never been smart enough to

00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:44,559
use it but it is kind of cool I do love

00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:47,650
me some every image that I did here

00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,109
I edited under it's a really really

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,819
good tool I did buy the gift book but

00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:54,220
it's funny I got it and it was on

00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:56,920
windows not that that really matters but

00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,359
you know it was us like okay what is

00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,170
those weird icons around the window

00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,810
frame

00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:05,390
but no is for what I do again for

00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:07,400
my needs it's more than perfect and the

00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:09,230
thing I love about it is if I'm on

00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,150
anybody's computer running an open

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:14,300
source distribution I can install it and

00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:18,890
edit my files I control my creations not

00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:21,050
adobe media management this I keep

00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:23,740
adding adding pictures to the slide it's

00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:26,450
amazing what's out there to manage your

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,060
videos and your podcasts and things like

00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:33,530
that are they is easy to use with

00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:35,360
devices as iTunes no iTunes is beautiful

00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,670
I mean it's it's a pig doing me wrong

00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:41,060
but the functionality of it is there's a

00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:42,740
lot there but there are a lot of cool

00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,090
things going out there now like one of

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,490
them I found just recently is called

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,950
nightingale I think it was a fork of

00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:51,350
something called sparrow and they

00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,600
seriously tried to become an itunes

00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,890
clone they that's their thing we're

00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,900
going to be like iTunes so it looks very

00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:59,030
much like iTunes they have the same

00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,550
genre artist album thing it looks like

00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:04,520
iTunes where Nightingale fails at least

00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,960
for me is in device support I want to be

00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,200
able to plug in the device and click and

00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,210
drag their playlists and files from one

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,700
system to the other and Nightingale

00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:17,390
isn't as good about that again I've only

00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,340
been using it for a few hours but for

00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:22,040
playing stuff on your on your computer

00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,970
it's great I also came across this thing

00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,910
called tomahawk is anyone hurt tomahawk

00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:30,200
that's for the youngins in the crowd

00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,970
tomahawk basically says the idea of

00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,040
listening and organizing music on your

00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:35,960
hard disk is stupid and you should be

00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,700
it's all going to be on the cloud it's

00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,610
going to have Amazon Cloud last.fm

00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:43,060
pandora spotify all of these things so

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,710
they have plugins where you can create

00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:48,020
you know soundcloud youtube spotify

00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:49,820
last.fm grooveshark you plug into all

00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,010
your online media and it allows you to

00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,470
manage that which other is kind of cool

00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,510
because i never really i don't do that

00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,450
i'm old i don't have a lot of media out

00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:01,850
there but i did want to throw that out

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,910
there because i'd not heard of it and it

00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:07,040
looks to be pretty good amarok is

00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:08,330
probably one of the better players out

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,040
there it's one of the few KDE

00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,820
applications that doesn't start with a

00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,840
que

00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:17,290
I never really understood ends with a k

00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:20,150
but it's a it doesn't start with a k

00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:22,250
amarok is really cool it was a you can

00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,530
install it and run it on other desktops

00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,150
that first install is going to look

00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,920
really huge because it's got to download

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:30,200
all pretty much all of KDE so the

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,070
libraries are there but you can run

00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,330
amarok on other distributions I used it

00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,650
for a little bit and I found it was a

00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,010
little too there was too much

00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:41,570
information there and again for me the

00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,590
problem with KDE is it too is to

00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:46,820
customizable so I don't use amarok

00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:49,640
Clementine was when I played with it has

00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:53,300
pretty decent device support rhythmbox

00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:58,210
is what ships with genome 3 and with

00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:01,400
ubuntu but i like banshee now banshee is

00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:03,740
uses mono which is like part of C sharp

00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,900
something everyone hates it because it

00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:09,490
Microsoft's involved but I really really

00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:13,220
like banshee because I can take this the

00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,770
micro SD card out of my phone plug it in

00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,770
and I can manage all of my playlists and

00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,330
everything directly in banshee again

00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,040
there's a PPA for Banshee so I'm get the

00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:25,610
latest and greatest banshee it's pretty

00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,040
cool I the biggest failing of all of

00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,720
these guys is I was used to plugging my

00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,710
iphone up to the computer and being able

00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,690
to deal with it with android phones

00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:38,060
they've switched to this thing called

00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,470
MTP media transfer protocol it used to

00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,160
be when you pledge your android phone in

00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:44,720
it was it would mount as a USB Drive

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,920
which is a block device and what that

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,600
means is only one thing can connect to a

00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,520
block of ice at a time so the moment you

00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,490
connected it to your computer your phone

00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:59,150
ceased being a phone assuming that there

00:48:55,490 --> 00:49:01,250
was only one mount point one SD card so

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:05,030
what I found was I could pop the SD card

00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:08,570
out of my my phone store all my music

00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:10,730
there and add this thing called is audio

00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,200
player so you create this dot is audio

00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:14,810
player file and here's an example of

00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,550
mine and what it would allow you to do

00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:20,690
is when you plug it in banshee

00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:23,210
recognizes that card as a media device

00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,030
and then I'm able to drag my playlist

00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,760
and everything over

00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,870
it works really really well so I threw

00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,000
that out there because again that was

00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:33,050
probably a week of my life figuring out

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,460
how to do that the thing I do like about

00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:37,260
the all of these is you can integrate

00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,180
with the bun too I mean here I got

00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,090
Clementine rhythmbox and ban chi all

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,740
installed so you can integrate these

00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:47,280
things into the desktop and play your

00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:49,080
music so I'm going a little faster

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,520
because I'm in going I'll talk I'm so

00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,410
excited about this I'll talk all day and

00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,690
I'm trying to get through this managing

00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:57,270
photographs this is a big thing a lot of

00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:59,690
people really like managing the

00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:03,390
photographs so this is your iPhoto

00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:05,370
options did you cam again the k is for

00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:06,690
KDE it's Katie ease photo management

00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,960
game that doesn't start with a k either

00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:11,790
but it has AK in the middle Shotwell is

00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,210
kind of the big one right now the thing

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:17,550
I like about digit cam overshot well is

00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:19,860
is that did you cam allows you to

00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:22,740
organize things and the actual folders

00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,960
on your hard drive whereas shotwell is

00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,180
more of a tagging you know the folk that

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,130
they live where they live but you tag

00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,980
the different things but here's did you

00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:34,340
camp very beautiful very easy to use

00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:37,170
shot well again is a very very pretty

00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:41,130
application you've got dark table is

00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:42,330
more of a lightroom knock off again one

00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,790
hundred percent free and open source

00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:47,460
software I'm not a photographer I pretty

00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:51,260
much take pictures with my phone but if

00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,580
you're a photographer you're good to go

00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,900
after shot I put this up here friend of

00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:58,410
mine who's really into photography uses

00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:02,100
it it's a pay it's a commercial app but

00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:04,290
Windows Mac and Linux so if you run a

00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,730
bun to or fedora they actually have

00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,380
packages that you can install and

00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,150
'iblame Shuttleworth for this there are

00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,100
people like corona corel has always been

00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,320
pretty Linux friendly to begin with but

00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,600
you know now these people have this

00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,420
market they can exploit by sending by

00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,550
writing to bunted if you want to migrate

00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,760
from iPhoto iPhoto uses a proprietary

00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:25,770
database and so what I found was there

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,180
was no easy way all the photos were in

00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:29,340
this big file there weren't like

00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:33,060
individual photo files so i found this

00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:34,440
script on google code which allows me

00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,120
it's called pho share which will

00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,770
actually run out and grab

00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,160
all of your folders and put them into

00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:43,410
file system so it was needed for me

00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,690
instead of trying to export and drag out

00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:48,720
six thousand photos or whatever it I had

00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,760
so something to throw out there video

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,090
editing editing I don't know if KTN live

00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,010
is here but they have been at other

00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,170
other conferences a really really cool

00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:03,780
video editing suite there's also open

00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:06,480
shot when I got my my little Ubuntu del

00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,280
Lubuntu system I did a little boot video

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,110
and compared it to my Mac booting the

00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,480
same way as much much faster on the on

00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,910
the dell and i did a little video and

00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,300
setting it up i needed to clip like 15

00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:20,640
seconds of the thing at get install open

00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,620
shot and I mean it was intuitive enough

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,720
that I was able to load it in clip out

00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,610
that 30-second save it and save it a

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,250
format that was perfect for youtube and

00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:31,260
uploaded to the youtube account amazing

00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:34,050
stuff that i recently had to have a head

00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,150
CT so I asked being a geek I said can I

00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,830
have a copy of it and they gave me a

00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,330
disk so I shoved the disk into my ubuntu

00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:42,210
system and I double clicked on an image

00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:44,820
and it goes oh you don't have any apps

00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:46,860
to do this but here's some that run in

00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,540
Syene is something called ginkgo

00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,910
something I installed a pretty soon I'm

00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:53,850
looking at pictures of my head and just

00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:56,910
wonderful stuff lots of really good apps

00:52:53,850 --> 00:53:00,240
out there virtual machines the Zen folks

00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:03,090
are here this is kvm it's very very easy

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,610
to create virtual machines under linux

00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:08,070
one thing i have not been able to do is

00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:12,380
vmware fusion allowed me to have like a

00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:15,600
windows partition and i can run it from

00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:17,010
OS 10 so i kind of showed up and i could

00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,250
I have not been able to figure out how

00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:23,880
to do that with kbm I can boot into it I

00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:25,110
just can't run it here's a little extra

00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,510
credit I'll throw this up there because

00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:29,550
this took me a week if you want to set

00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,890
up bridging it's very very easy to do

00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:33,390
with vmware fusion the idea is I want to

00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:35,850
have a virtual machine that has an IP

00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,790
address of its own so that I can get to

00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,260
it from other systems you have to set a

00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:41,730
bridging to get that to happen and this

00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,040
is where you do you edit your at the

00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:48,480
interfaces your SD network interfaces

00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:51,180
file okay um I got eight minutes um

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,660
so at one point time I said screw this

00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:57,030
i'm going to go back to OS 10 and I and

00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,220
if I'm gonna if I'm going to you know

00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,900
drink the kool-aid I was all in so i

00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,590
upgraded from snow leopard to lion I

00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:06,990
hated lion i frickin and this is one of

00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,720
the reasons look at the I cow oh it has

00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,400
faux leather and has this vomit brown

00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,770
border that's supposed to look like

00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,060
leather and you can't see it here if you

00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,830
actually if you guys are run in line

00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,300
find one of the glowing fruit people and

00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,600
have them show you this there's like a

00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,160
little piece of torn paper like right up

00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,050
over the today there's this little piece

00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,470
of torn paper like someone tore off the

00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:30,210
thing I don't want a you know digital

00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,000
representations of real world things I

00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:35,790
want efficient things an apple used to

00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,990
pride itself on being really clean and

00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,430
you could get the information now we've

00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:41,280
got oh it's a book in this little

00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:44,010
bookmark and stuff I hated lion and the

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,869
fact that it saved versions for you and

00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:47,970
you couldn't turn it off and you

00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:49,560
sometimes I get everything cluttered and

00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,420
I said screw it i'll log out log back in

00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,090
and had log back in all my stuff was

00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,550
still there so i had to manually close

00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,570
oh god I hated line but I had time

00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,640
machine so I'll put it back with snow

00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:01,470
leopard and I have not looked back since

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,109
so everyone has this idea because you

00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,580
get locked in this idea that well apples

00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:08,010
just better right because at one point

00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,570
in time they were but the truth of the

00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,550
matter is there's lots of good stuff out

00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,440
there and apple doesn't already ways

00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,119
make the right decisions I bet you in

00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,940
the next version of those 10 this crap

00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,980
will be gone because so many people have

00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,820
complained about it but I can't change

00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,590
it because I don't get the option yeah I

00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,230
did like we're scrolling anyone use

00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,730
reverse scrolling under OS 10 it's kind

00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,859
of cool because it's more natural for

00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:34,230
trackpads well you can turn that on and

00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:36,060
if you create a file called x-mode map

00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,490
and you're in your home directory add

00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,140
these pointers you can actually reverse

00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:43,290
scrolling and it works really really

00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:45,060
well so again I was like oh this is kind

00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:47,670
of cool i wonder if it's in linux a two

00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,920
second google search and i had it so

00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:51,869
i'll put that out there i did switch to

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,930
mobile phone again i tried to switch to

00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:57,000
I had to try to get away from everything

00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:00,540
Apple I think we should call them

00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,220
handies I'm sorry if you go to Germany

00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,290
they call mobile phone

00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:06,480
these you'll see ads you know best price

00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,820
for your handy and I think they mean

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,660
handy is inconvenient but they're not

00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,890
phones anymore their hand terminals

00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,720
that's what they are but hand terminals

00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,980
kind of kind of hard to say you know

00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,800
give me your hand terminals show me what

00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,630
your hand terminal he's kind of cute so

00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,910
I'm going to try to single-handedly

00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,369
start calling them handies in America

00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:29,340
and so if you look at me funny that's

00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:31,590
where it was so I got an android phone i

00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:33,720
bought a galaxy s three from AT&T and

00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:36,140
within 45 minutes of getting home I

00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,310
based it and put on cyanogenmod

00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,650
cyanogenmod is one of a number of

00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:42,270
android open source projects they take

00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,790
because nowadays when you buy a samsung

00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,880
phone there's crap on it and I hate crap

00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:49,290
on my phone like I saw yellow pages app

00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,390
and I said oh I want to remove the

00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:54,720
yellow pages app you can't the yellow

00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:56,970
pages app is a critical system hat it's

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,170
critical because yellow pages paid you

00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,270
to put it on there but it's not critical

00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:03,140
to me and I want to make that choice

00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:05,730
love cyanogenmod those guys are great

00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,900
they're getting ready for a 110 release

00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,720
which i think is just going to rule i'm

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,160
running the release candidates right now

00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,900
things i like about it again everyone

00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,220
thinks Apple was the greatest when it

00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,859
comes to design I actually have an

00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:20,250
unlocked 3gs I use when I'm overseas and

00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:22,950
I feel constrained when I'm on an Apple

00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:25,470
phone I just do um one of the things i

00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:27,390
like is widgets so you can put these

00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,619
things called widgets that just live on

00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,589
your desktop their apps that you don't

00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:33,089
have to open like here's my calendar you

00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:36,720
know I can just glance at my calendar

00:57:33,089 --> 00:57:39,030
this is on one of my desktops I almost

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,859
every app that I use with the exception

00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:43,800
of plants vs zombies well plants vs

00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:47,130
zombies 2 will not be out on Android but

00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:49,589
you know almost every app I use comes

00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:53,520
out of Android um I like the fact you

00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:55,140
can customize the the lock screen so

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,089
when I'm running power amp I can

00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,130
actually be playing my music and I don't

00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,450
have to unlock it to skip of track or

00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:04,230
replay a track or anything like that

00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:05,730
it's really really cool i do want to

00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,380
point out one of the things one of the

00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,030
frustrations i had my main frustration

00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,859
was to sync my contacts i had to go

00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,900
through google which I've solved with so

00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:15,390
go mother frustration is there really

00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,970
isn't a lot of open source software

00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:20,730
available for Android androids open

00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:23,250
source but I use k-9 mail Jessie Vincent

00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:25,500
the guy wrote request tracker wrote k-9

00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,970
mail and its really good in its Foss but

00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,950
outside and I'm looking forward to the

00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,140
day when we have more open source

00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:33,329
software on Android but I really really

00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:35,339
I can't go back and finally there's this

00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:37,950
new open source app called red phone

00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:39,480
which if I make an Andrew if I make a

00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,579
phone call to another person on an

00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,430
android phone running red phone it'll

00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:46,170
encrypt the voice now there's a guy here

00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,000
from verizon but he says he doesn't

00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:51,210
involved in the i stole your stuff for

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,260
the government and i feel i feel bad for

00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,180
him because I know someone's going to

00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,869
get that all weekend hey did you steal

00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:00,150
my stuff but you can't encrypt voice on

00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:02,099
an iPhone because apple doesn't allow

00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:05,579
developers access to that part of the

00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:08,760
phone android they do so you are able to

00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:14,599
get cool stuff like that okay wireless

00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,599
routers one really quick here um pardon

00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:23,630
the multi-touch one to touch oh yeah I

00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:23,630
haven't played with it yet

00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:40,080
I've been wanting to try that so I don't

00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:42,090
have a nexus foam which is where there a

00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,369
lot of the ports are now but i think

00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,020
that say i don't know i think they say

00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:49,350
the linux desktop is dead linux desktop

00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:51,600
might win by default because apple wants

00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,740
to do do stuff i only have I want to

00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,060
talk to you later i got like two minutes

00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,000
to get through three slides so I'm gonna

00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,470
out but I do want to talk to you after

00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,170
anyway I put this up this is for Kevin

00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:03,750
audio and ipv6 folks over here I bought

01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:06,780
an asus router to replace my airport

01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:08,790
extreme put this linux-based distro

01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:12,090
called tomato tomatoe USB by this guy

01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:14,010
named shitty out of Poland and it has

01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,840
built-in ipv6 support so you can do a

01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:18,359
chi tunnels you can do tons of really

01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,650
cool stuff so now i'm running open

01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:21,990
source so i've gotten rid of my phone

01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:24,000
I've got rid of my imac's I'm now gotten

01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:27,119
rid of my router what I haven't done is

01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,990
I'm still have my I TV DVR I'm looking

01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:34,290
at XBMC and openelec to replace that I

01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:36,240
think there are drivers for the ITV USB

01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:38,730
so that might be cool and I haven't

01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,530
found anything for airtunes I love the

01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,760
fact that I'm distribute music I mean

01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:44,160
there's some things that are coming up

01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,240
if you guys know anything find me and

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,830
tell me I think there's this thing

01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,480
called so knows that has some kind of

01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:50,940
distributed player but I haven't been

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,630
able to get that to work anyway what I

01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,580
want to leave you with is a lot of

01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:59,369
what's happening in IT is they're aimed

01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:00,570
at consumption you know Apple wants to

01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:02,609
make money because every piece of

01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:05,010
software you consume they get thirty

01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:07,260
percent of it but what I want you to do

01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:10,890
is choose to create more than you

01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:13,320
consume and choose to own your creations

01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:15,810
don't get locked up in Photoshop don't

01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,430
get locked up in keynote don't get

01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:19,920
locked up in these proprietary formats

01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:25,050
choose make the choice to own what you

01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:27,600
create and then finally my experience it

01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:29,700
was frustrating I said but I love it I

01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,280
can't go back now I'm in a great

01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,200
position opt out of the cloud you know

01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,790
make a decision when you post off on g+

01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,040
and Facebook and Twitter and you post

01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:39,450
your documents up there choose to do

01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:43,290
that don't just do it automatically

01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:45,090
because you have that right um having

01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,230
options is the best feature everyone

01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:47,120
talks about this is a great feature out

01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:48,740
to me the

01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,660
having the option to change something is

01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,630
the best feature any application can

01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:56,570
have and own what you create anyway it

01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:58,490
is right at ten o'clock this is me I do

01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,680
have a blog called adventures in OSS

01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:02,420
calm with a no Apple tag which has

01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,160
details of all the different things

01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:06,230
thank you so much we have a party

01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,580
tonight MC frontalot is here the thought

01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,230
criminals are here google is paying for

01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,440
the beer hope to see you tonight thank

01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,440
very much

01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,369
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,530
way to better utilize all your resources

01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:25,980
and it makes managing all your resources

01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:29,839
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:33,299
happening in open source the

01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:35,130
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:37,079
of the community and then the speed at

01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:38,970
which these are these you know these

01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,920
these deficiencies these bugs are

01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:43,260
getting discovered and then fixed is

01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:46,710
that I think that really shows the power

01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:48,510
of the of the open source community it

01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:52,680
is global and it's definitely because of

01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:55,079
the users community people are extremely

01:03:52,680 --> 01:04:00,299
friendly and they're always ready to

01:03:55,079 --> 01:04:01,770
help if you go on tire see any day

01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:04,079
you'll see these guys helping each other

01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:06,480
out and they're all doing it like in a

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,339
selfless manner the product is

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,119
transparent for everyone everyone can

01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:14,579
look at the code base everyone can see

01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:17,160
how both darkest is being built nothing

01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:22,290
nothing is proprietary everything is

01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:27,780
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:31,650
to the the unborn health CloudStack the

01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:35,610
most exciting event in recent memory for

01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:38,340
he was our first developer boot camp

01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:40,980
and our call gave people I gave me two

01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:44,940
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:49,110
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:51,960
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:54,480
chairs into the room twice everything

01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,720
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,810
is open source and so I don't think that

01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,550
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:05,580
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:08,310
computing and so i think it's i think

01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:09,660
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,770
about cloud computing you're really

01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:16,320
talking about open source cloud

01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:19,470
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:21,870
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:25,770
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:28,440
each data center is these hardware is

01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:31,920
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,650
to handle number one that mass scale

01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,800
number two it's designed to handle the

01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:40,350
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:43,890
deployments started working on college

01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:47,250
attack over four years ago and it was

01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:49,920
the original set of people working on it

01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:54,030
had a background of delivering software

01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:58,260
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:05:54,030 --> 01:06:01,890
lots of users actually using it high

01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:04,950
availability is a key feature multiple

01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:07,140
hypervisors support different network

01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:10,140
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:11,910
better while step management server can

01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:15,600
be deployed in different physical

01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:17,250
machines it definitely has a huge

01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:22,260
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:24,840
there's a major movie studio that they

01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:28,140
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:30,120
to transcode video and i thought that

01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,740
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,010
more fascinating is what they did during

01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:37,800
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:38,970
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,800
lunch was over they would this

01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:44,940
all the instances and go back to doing

01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:46,560
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,660
so many different aspects and there's no

01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,030
one person that's kind of like a master

01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:55,140
of all those realms I think CloudStack

01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:57,360
as a project is going to be one of the

01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:01,410
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:06,840
most feature folan and and robust

01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:09,740
platforms I hope they learn Adam senior

01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,740
living through the clouds dag

01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,640
you

01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:33,020
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:34,970
ago we could not have imagined that

01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:37,190
asterisk would not only become the most

01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:39,320
widely adopted open source communication

01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:41,360
software on the planet but that it would

01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,880
impact the entire industry in the way

01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:45,860
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,500
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:50,450
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,520
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:53,930
transition of power from the hands of

01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:56,210
the traditional proprietary phone

01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:58,610
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:00,530
administrators of foam systems using

01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:01,760
this power our customers have created

01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,710
all sorts of business changing

01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,570
applications from small office phone

01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:08,090
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:09,680
the international carrier networks in

01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:11,480
fact there's even an entire country

01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,060
those communications infrastructure runs

01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,010
on esters the gym has always been about

01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:17,720
creating technology that expands

01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,880
communications capabilities in ways that

01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,080
we could never have imagined and that's

01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,450
part of what's game-changing about

01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:26,150
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:28,250
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:30,380
IP phones that extends control of the

01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:32,120
user all the way to the desktop the

01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,830
launch of these new products represents

01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,839
the next phase indigenous history of

01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:38,330
innovation these are the first and only

01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:39,680
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,359
power of esther's when we first

01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,010
discussed our expectations for building

01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,620
a family of phones for use with asterisk

01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:47,420
our requirements were pretty simple we

01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:49,160
asked the team to build the phones such

01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:51,350
that they were easy to install integrate

01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:53,210
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:55,760
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:57,410
that goal user feedback is validating

01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,510
that when it comes to operation with

01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:01,940
astro space systems including our own

01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:04,520
Switchvox based product these are the

01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:05,810
easiest to use best integrated most

01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,420
interoperable products on the market

01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:10,390
today the Digium family of phones will

01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:12,500
initially include three IP des hommes

01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:14,390
uniquely designed to complement any

01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,279
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:18,950
these phones are different for a number

01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:21,589
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:23,029
designed for use with esters secondly

01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:24,640
we've made it really easy to

01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:27,020
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,700
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,670
to access information inside of

01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,670
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:34,630
between an application and the phone

01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:36,790
additionally we've created an

01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:38,920
applications engine that allows users

01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:42,160
and developers to create and run their

01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,929
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,880
done all of this at a very compelling

01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:47,560
price point at Digium we're always

01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,660
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:52,179
the best value in business phone systems

01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,770
and also give them the power to create

01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:55,929
their own solutions or any

01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,640
communications challenge will continue

01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:59,050
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,120
Astra's cooler faster and more

01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:02,739
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,230
asterisk and what communications even

01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:08,940
easier and together we'll change the way

01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,940
the world communicates again

01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:18,750
most enterprises today realize that

01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,400
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:22,770
enough to keep their networks saved from

01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,840
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,880
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,980
popular lately that adds that extra

01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,650
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:33,420
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:35,640
know is that some two-factor

01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:37,830
authentication solutions they're better

01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,890
than others like two-factor strong

01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:43,140
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:45,120
beyond other authentication systems by

01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:48,180
being less expensive easier to implement

01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,640
and easier to use giving software-based

01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:53,490
token clients built to run on all major

01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,120
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:58,440
Android these tokens utilize a

01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,840
public/private key combination that's

01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,790
generated on device so there aren't any

01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,310
shared secrets flying around or

01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:08,190
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:10,050
special handling instead all keys are

01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:12,510
kept secure and private between the

01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:14,700
requesting token and your server which

01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:16,320
you control in-house making it the most

01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,990
secure way possible to perform

01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,810
authentication encryption and with an

01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:24,570
extensive flexible API and support for

01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:26,550
protocols like ldap and radius wicked

01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:28,199
works with any enterprise network

01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:30,440

requires insight into what they're doing

01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:09,550
your system metrics tells stories

01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,560
stories that can reveal performance

01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,900
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,460
other problems but how do you keep an
