the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,860

linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,080
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,929
possible why we're skipping ahead natok

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,719
his raspberry pi case has a fan I think

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,430
my my google chat status for a long time

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,250
has been huddling over as very pie for

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:44,280
work because it actually hello my name

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,780
is Ruth Seeley and this is Tom and you

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,489
gotta be true things at us for the next

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,710
hour so and so this is both if you know

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,360
nothing about the raspberry pi and think

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,430
that soft slope might have to do fruit

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,570
beer and ice cream that's okay and if

00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,520
you already have a raspberry pie with a

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,930
fan on it i don't i might not tell you

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,539
anything but some other people we might

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,949
tell some interesting things and so at

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,450
some point when writing the slightest

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,460
idea of pie on your face was a good name

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,619
and if you know larry shapiro he decided

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,010
he needed to actually have a pot on this

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,509
face so it's great about the pie it's

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,790
super cheap you can slap on the guys

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,020
face and if for some reason his beard

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,909
breaks that i don't think that's likely

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,070
but it's okay because it was 35 bucks

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,400
and you give them a new pie you put a

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,780
new SD card it's all cool but let's

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,450
start with a little history of the

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,549
raspberry pi and where it came from this

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,320
cool guy named evan upton at the

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,479
university of Cambridge's computer lab

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,040
was actually worried about the declining

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,380
computer skills of the students coming

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,450
into the university the kind of looked

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,790
around the classroom when you guys could

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,860
use some help but then of course the

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,390
solution to that is not to teach college

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,659
students but to educate people at

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,820
younger ages and so the pie was designed

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,020
to be an inexpensive computer and thus

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,939
easy to get into the hands of children

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,680
so that children would learn computer

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,380
skills early on and eventually become

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,689
much smarter students in his classroom

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,399
so around 2008 he was a chip architect

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,280
at broadcom and got together with some

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,700
others the the first alpha boards came

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,620
out in august of 20 less

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,290
and then by January to model be

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,180
manufacturing had started and then they

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,410
shift in April and if you were looking

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,420
for one then they were a lot harder to

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,400
get than they are now but and then in

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,879
October just as past October the new

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,760
versions with 512 megs of ram came out

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,200
and so the 256 so he thought you know a

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,970
few people will think this was pretty

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,430
interesting and so the first run was

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,260
10,000 Ford's and the first day they had

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,790
a hundred thousand orders and now there

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,459
are more than a million out there it's

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,709
not they're not hard to come by anymore

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:47,730
but just for a little flashback to think

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:50,980
might know what this is a computer it is

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,319
that guy apprised it was inspired by

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,690
this thing which is the BBC micro which

00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,920
came out December of 1981 which may be

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,019
before computer guy was born and it also

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,519
had a bottle a and a model B which was

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,099
where those names for the Raspberry Pi

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,730
models come from it had a two megahertz

00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:13,660
processor and the model a had 16k of RAM

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,290
very exciting the model B had 32 is

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,510
madness but what's great you can see the

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,790
inspiration this is an ad for the the

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,500
micro and it says educational uses in

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,400
big letters so the raspberry pi really

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,910
is sort of his future vision of the have

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,410
the BBC micro so let's talk about the

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,989
actual pie itself if you haven't seen

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,590
one that's the the big picture the pie

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:40,150
an extra SD card for scale but this is

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,650
what this is what's actually on it you

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,600
want to go through the list you can say

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,760
where it's to you Draghi yeah so a reef

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,920
hardware overview of what the pie has on

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,690
it it as I'm gonna talk about the model

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,030
B because it's much more interesting

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,940
than the model a but it has two USB

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,700
ports it has an ethernet port built in

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,769
it has onboard audio that goes out a

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:08,829
analog or HDMI has RCA and hdmi video

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,299
out it has several sort of standard

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,750
connectors that you see on embedded

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:17,090
boards like dsi but the coolest thing in

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,310
my opinion is the GPIO headers that are

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,419
attached to the board which allow you to

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,639
basically plug in or wire anything to

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:29,000
the pie and then control it directly

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,540
from the operating system the pie is

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,790
powered off of micro USB so it doesn't

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,060
take a lot of power it has no onboard

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,550
disk it boots entirely off of the SD

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,810
card so it's a little bit different from

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,699
what you might see in some other

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,639
embedded style machines that actually

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:50,060
have flash on the board that it uses to

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,130
boot off of the pie boots entirely off a

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,260
firmware written onto the SD card it

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,540
doesn't know how to do anything except

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,510
look at the SD card in a specific point

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,770
and load the firmware in from that some

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,180
days will it knows how to do is make you

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:08,780
mad yeah so but if it's not your super

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,370
awesome gaming tower it is not fast I

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,560
usually described it as a really cool

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,960
computer from 1997 what it's meant for

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,419
is those educational purposes and then

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,979
all of us people like you in as awesome

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,330
it's a tiny computer I could build crazy

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,880
crap with that and that's what we'll

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,310
show you later and but this idea there's

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,990
a flawless idea that it is a super cheap

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,450
computer because it costs thirty-five

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,349
dollars but if you don't have all this

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,820
other stuff it's suddenly not really

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,900
that cheapo computer and then in

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,400
addition all this you're going to need

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,729
an ethernet cable and you might want a

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,229
Wi-Fi dongle in I can't even tell you

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,639
how much I've spent on Adafruit in the

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:46,610
last couple of months buying random

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,169
things to plug into the pie so if you

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,300
have all these things on hand it is a

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,099
super awesome cheap computer to give a

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,479
kid if you don't have all these things

00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:56,150
on hand which is probably not true for

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,800
most of the people in this room the case

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,250
is different so where do you buy all

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,440
that fun stuff the raspberry pi plus $35

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,750
do not buy one on amazon there is not a

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,789
$35 raspberry pi on amazon there are

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,389
fifty dollar raspberry PI's on amazon it

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:14,150
that's stupid element14 is where you can

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,950
get the actual $35 raspberry pi but if

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,330
you're gonna do fun stuff with it you're

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,370
gonna play with it you're probably going

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,870
to want to buy some cool toys to go with

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,910
it so you might as well to go to like a

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,400
fruit adafruit has all those extra cool

00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,930
toys and they see things like we'll talk

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,199
about the SD cards in a minute but if

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,699
to save Daisy to install a distro on

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,120
your card you can buy one pre-installed

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:36,350
they sell that they sell the fruits

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,699
really good they have their own just run

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,620
everything so they're really good about

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,169
designing things and selling things

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,759
meant for the pie and so like they say

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,470
they've tested about eleventy billion

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,389
Wi-Fi dongles and they have to that

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,800
actually work you don't have to buy

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,240
eleventy billion you can buy the ones

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,259
they've already tested and assure you

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,330
work and cost like 1195 so but the point

00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,770
is adafruit sells the pie for forty

00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,030
dollars but if you're gonna buy all the

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,389
other stuff you might as well spend the

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,520
extra five bucks maker shed has a kit if

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,169
you really want to just buy what is it

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,330
like a hundred and fifty dollars for the

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,160
the maker shed introduction to raspberry

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,509
pi kit it has a cobbler board and all

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,669
sorts of other little toys that you can

00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,199
play with that's a good thing sparkfun

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:17,240
doesn't sell them spark consoles all

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,070
sorts of other things they sell the LEDs

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,870
I describe smartphone is what you wish

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,849
Radio Shack was except it's on the

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,900
internet they sell all the fun things so

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,180
you're not gonna get a pie there if

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,229
you're going to find others fun stuff

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,759
amazon is where you might buy like a

00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:31,340
missile launcher if you'd like to

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,900
control that you know other toys and in

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,490
a pant radioshack it does work like

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,990
where I live I have a super awesome

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,699
radio shack that actually sells these

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,520
things we went in one here yesterday

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,139
that was degrees less awesome and we're

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,960
like a cell phone store I got a cell

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:50,180
phone and and among those accessories is

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,340
the camera what so the last time I

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,870
talked about the PI packets scale which

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,460
I think was in February the camera

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,440
didn't exist yet Kimbra does exist now

00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,900
yes so one of the connectors I was

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,970
talking about is a dedicated connector

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,830
type that standardized in the industry

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,650
for things like cell phones and tablets

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,990
so they can tell manufacturers hey we

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,180
want this specification set of camera at

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,259
this price and they'll come back and say

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,520
sure we'll build you that and they don't

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,930
have to worry about how to connect it to

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,169
the board because it's using a standard

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,919
connector it's not quite that simple but

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:24,080
for purposes of explanation it is so the

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,199
Raspberry Pi has that standard connector

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,780
type and they've added support in their

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,849
firmware for a custom camera that they

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,430
have just started producing I tried very

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,659
hard to get one but after three hours of

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,490
wrestling with the website that was

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,320
continuously crashing for millions of

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,430
Raspberry Pi users trying to get their

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,260
hands on it

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,210
was unsuccessful but it looks exactly

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,420
like this and it's basically just a very

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,920
small camera the same basic

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,110
specifications you would find in a cell

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,180
phone except that the Raspberry Pi it

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,830
knows exactly how to drive it and just

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,560
and reveal it to the Linux operating

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,850
system or to any operating system while

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,350
we're talking about fun things that plug

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,510
into it is a good time to mention that

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,730
the pie is not an Arduino in a lot of

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,700
ways but in in this specific way the

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,380
Arduino has this vast almost ecosystem

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,940
of things that are designed to be

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,470
plugged into an Arduino this thing does

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,660
this specific thing with Arduino that

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,430
doesn't exist for pie yet there is a

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,750
shield there's an Arduino shield that

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,790
you put on the Raspberry Pi to use

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,980
Arduino accessories with it but it's not

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,990
it's not quite that kind of device it is

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,459
a tiny computer it is not an Arduino and

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,510
I think a lot of people get a little

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,459
confused they're like well they're

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,350
they're small they look like hardware

00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,029
its kind the same thing right but you

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,190
know you have to decide what you need

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,680
for the task that you want to do so

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,540
let's talk about getting started and and

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,920
the first thing is the right SD card

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,380
because that essentially is your hard

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,430
drive here and it makes the pie awesome

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,890
this is one of the best things about

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,860
using the pie for education and not even

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,020
for kids but if you've been using fedora

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,700
for 10 years and you're like well what's

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,190
up with these other distros you can

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,600
install 14 SD cards of all the different

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,250
distros and all you have to do is plug

00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,870
the next one into the pie and try it out

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,420
you don't have to reinstall everything

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,600
from scratch and spend all day 28 you

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,160
can have one pie and 14 different things

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,540
you want to do with it and you just put

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,860
in the extra accessories that you want

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,050
to use there is a list on a linux org

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,550
has a great wiki full of all sorts of

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,350
pie information and they have a list of

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,029
SD cards that have been tested with the

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,640
pie so it's nice to check across like

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,500
there used to be a bug with the class 10

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,360
cards and most of them didn't work it

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,370
tells you that they don't work with the

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,529
the microSD cards with the adapter

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,290
except that's what is it adafruit cells

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,910
with them dirty boy yeah we keep using

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,160
them clearly they do work so that part

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,149
is alive but in general the Lissa is

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,190
nice to refer to and also a lot of the

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,660
cheap cards are noted as claiming to

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,790
have more capacity than they actually

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,959
have so if you have something you think

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,940
you're going to need a lot of room on

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,520
your pies SD card you should probably

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,170
just pony up for a nice SD card you bet

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,180
you paid $35 for computer

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,610
can buy a nicer SD card don't buy your

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,100
SD cards at Walmart there there's the

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,690
Linux the e linux Edward link i was i

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:08,240
was mentioning do you have a couple of

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,790
display options talk about those yeah so

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,949
like i said before it does have hdmi out

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,279
so it does one not three and one dot for

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:19,160
standard you can't pass hdmi back into

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:21,500
the device it's a pure output port but

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,120
it does a very good job it is audio and

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,639
video integrated into it across the

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,230
standard and it I haven't seen it fail

00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,810
yet there's some stuff on the internet

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,730
about various monitors that are not too

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,490
smart about hdmi not quite working

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,620
properly but the PI firmware Allah has

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,910
things like over scan mode a lot of

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,889
tweaking to try to get the dimensions

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,720
right on the screen and honestly I've

00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,459
thrown a lot of really awful cheap

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,930
monitors at the pie and so far all of

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,440
them have worked with minimal tweaking

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,630
but it does have old-school connectors

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,600
for the audio in the video and they both

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,800
work great but there is no vga which is

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,870
different from a lot of the other

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,660
embedded hardware in this space and

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,670
mostly that was a cost in form factor

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,620
decision because if you've got a laptop

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,940
from a couple years ago that has vga you

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,360
can see that they get it to the

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,370
thickness of the VGA port and no thinner

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,290
but thankfully they made the decision

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,480
sort of to not worry about that there's

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,839
a lot of aftermarket kits out there to

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,000
convert any of the ports on there to a

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,529
VGA port I've also seen some people who

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,500
have done some real clever wiring to

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:28,130
attach a VGA dongle to the GPIO ports

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,839
but I don't really recommend that there

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,449
is a dsi connector on there so that you

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,709
could put a proper screen on it but just

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,630
the same situation with the camera

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:38,390
you've got to have the firmware on the

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,149
pie and be able to start the device so

00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,970
the huggable to the operating system and

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:46,220
currently there aren't any supported

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,440
devices in the firmware so that's

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,230
something that they plan on adding and

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,730
releasing a screen for it but you can't

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,410
just take apart a cell phone or a tablet

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,510
and shove it in there even though the

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,220
connector is identical because it just

00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,800
won't work unless you feel like reverse

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,870
engineering and proprietary firmware

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,160
there's also it's part of what we're

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,600
going to talk about is fun projects

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,750
there's one called the kindle berry pie

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,490
where a guy

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,320
hooked it up to use a kindle as the

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,600
screen because the kindle uses micro USB

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,880
you plug it right into the USB port it's

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,170
it's one of the most amusing blog post

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,570
it's a detailed description you can

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,220
absolutely reproduce what he does but he

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,600
highly recommends you you have a spare

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,850
kindle for this purpose and not your

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,440
beloved reading device and actually says

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,790
things along the lines of if you're an

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,190
idiot you should probably not undertake

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:34,230
this task he's really he's very blunt in

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,670
his instruction touch screens yeah so

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,320
one of the first things i wanted to do

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,030
with the pie when I got it was given a

00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,650
touchscreen and of course my first

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,940
thought was hey this dsi connector is

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,200
great i'll just take apart a tablet and

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,340
shove it right in there and that was how

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,840
i learned more than I ever wanted to

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,480
know about the firmware limitations of

00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,510
the Raspberry Pi so instead I started

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,160
looking at USB touchscreen devices and

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,840
one of the ones that had some good

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,840
support out there was from a company

00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,390
called me mo so I got a mimo 720 and

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,210
that one is supported by the display

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,240
link frame buffer driver it's actually a

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:09,330
display link touch screen so it's using

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,820
a couple different drivers the current

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,350
linux kernel has both the old frame

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,540
buffer driver and the kernel mode

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,810
setting driver the kernel mode setting

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,550
driver has a few bugs in it so when i

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,320
started really getting into those bugs

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,790
and i was trying to write patches for

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,710
the linux kernel i said maybe i'm just

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,960
going to step back and use the old frame

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,600
buffer driver that's actually working so

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,850
i started doing that and that works well

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,990
with ex one of my thoughts was that I

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,190
wanted use a distribution called

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:41,430
openelec which is a nice interface for

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,560
media playback it boots basically into

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,920
an entertainment system so you can play

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,580
games music movies TV shows video files

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,970
all these sorts of things but because of

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,500
how the openelec distribution doesn't

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,390
actually include support in the kernel

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,040
for these drivers in order to do that

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,750
you're going to have to rebuild colonel

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,400
drivers to get the touchscreen working

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:09,990
and they don't have any touchscreen

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:11,339
drivers in their build so yes it is tell

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,310
us where you would find that kernel

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,700
source Tom so the nice thing about the

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,589
raspberry pi is that they have a pretty

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,490
good commitment to open source and free

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,279
software

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,130
everything but the firmware is out there

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,200
with source code and the firmware is

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,320
something that they have a overinflated

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,060
value of and will never release so the

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,920
but the good news is is that they have

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,470
all the patches necessary to boot all

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,110
the hardware and devices on the pie in

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,959
git and github specifically so there's a

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,760
Raspberry Pi repo on github then there's

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,020
constant work going on there where

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,490
they're merging changes from other

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,970
people it's a very active and healthy

00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,800
upstream they have two branches the time

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,029
this was written there was you had to

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,070
sort of pick one whether you want to be

00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:59,580
on 32 27 or you ever wanted to be on the

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,680
36 moving target tree but the 32 tree is

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,220
pretty dead now so it's entirely a 36

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,390
tree but you just start you check it out

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,820
and you build it just like a normal

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,500
linux kernel now everyone is sort of

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,420
hoping that at some point they won't be

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,890
a fork that the patches will end up back

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,000
in main line and some of the changes

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,680
have but not most of them and when I

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,209
talk to folks that do a lot more work in

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,399
the linux kernel than i do the general

00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:25,770
feedback is that they don't think it's

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,600
ever going to merge in but you know

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,370
maybe maybe you'll be the person that

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,880
takes that task on and gets the rest of

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,560
that work done but this is where i'm

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,660
going to let Ruth tell a fun little

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,270
story about the make mr. proper command

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,829
it's your sensory so this is I didn't

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,360
Satan perhaps I should have said this up

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,850
front the two of us are working on a

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,740
raspberry hype i hacks book for a riley

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,440
and so learned all sorts of new things

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,120
but this was the the fun facts as i was

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,870
editing stuff hebrew so it's actually

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,550
his story about this make mr. proper is

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,170
like a super duper version of make clean

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,440
do you know why it's called make mr.

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:05,970
proper because that's the International

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,230
International name for mr. clean when

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,880
Louis was doing the work he said well

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,079
i'm gonna i'm gonna add that bald faced

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,130
guy that's all in the cleaning solution

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,929
which is in where he is mr. proper fun

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,929
facts you let you'll win your next linux

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:21,329
trivia contest so the next up now you

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,949
got your SD card and and perhaps we

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:25,050
rambled too far on the colonel before we

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,420
got to picking a distro so obviously we

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,160
perhaps are a bit biased as fodor ins

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,990
towards pie dora which just got

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,880
officially released a week and half ago

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,470
or so and

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,090
that's the version of fedora optimized

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,100
for the Raspberry Pi and have some fun

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,540
features but I also support choosing the

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,820
distro that actually accomplishes what

00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,870
you want to do and so for example i

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,430
mentioned Adafruit has their own

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,430
distribution and it's called

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,710
occidentalis and it is meant for

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,320
hardware hacking in particular it adds

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:56,490
in a bunch of jazz on top of Raz B and

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,900
wheezy if you want to build XBMC raspbmc

00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,910
is a better choice that's what it's

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,530
designed to do so definitely biased

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,030
towards you choosing PI Dora and if you

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,530
go like right across the hall to the

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,900
Fedora boots you can get a jazzy little

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,230
pied or a sticker with a little pie on

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,410
it but again you know choose the distro

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,330
that is suited to your needs or that you

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,720
like the name of the best plan 9 from

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,030
Bell Labs there's a and this is a tiny

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,470
chunk of the listener ISM there are so

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,760
many districts we've like I think I'll

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,650
just built a new Raspberry Pi distro

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,850
today I think people have gone a little

00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,700
crazy but so will tell you a little bit

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,040
about PI Dora these are some of here you

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,060
talked about and I'll make it do stuff

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,980
so hi Dora is Fedora recompiled with the

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,020
optimization targets specifically for

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,410
the Raspberry Pi the Raspberry Pi is an

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:46,140
arm v6 with a hardware floating-point

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,210
unit so that's the optimization level

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,650
it's compiled for most of the arm

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,000
distributions out there unless they're

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,370
built for the Raspberry Pi aren't

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,070
optimized for the Raspberry Pi the older

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,230
ones are built arm v5 Ubuntu doesn't

00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,940
have an arm v5 billed for it natively

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,880
because all of their targets are arm v7

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,330
and so it their default arm build won't

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,430
even boot on the Raspberry Pi but we

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,340
added a tool for graphical configuration

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,680
just do things like resize the SD card

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,110
to fits the entire the partition

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,510
stretches across the whole SD card so

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,270
you're not wasting space to set up swap

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,920
properly to do memory allocation so that

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,420
you can set how much memory goes to the

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,020
GPU versus how much memory goes to the

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,090
system it's designed to be very small so

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,600
it can download quickly and then resize

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,970
across the whole partition later it does

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,500
include C Python and Perl support on the

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,990
image by default so that you can

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,510
immediately start writing code on it and

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,770
it also has the libraries to support all

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,290
the external hardware that you can plug

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,450
into the device

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:51,650
has all of the implementations that are

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,090
out there for gpio I to see spi and it

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:57,530
also has a full graphical boot

00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:00,080
environment xfce so that you can use all

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,850
the basic minimal development tools that

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,720
are out there for basically opening text

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:08,390
files so my favorite feature I was when

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,980
PI Dora came out it was the day after i

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,540
just turned in an article for linux

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,040
magazine about going headless with the

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,320
raspberry pi for all sorts of projects

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,580
and what you could do and so i'm totally

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,630
going to fake this because otherwise we

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,700
have to boot it up and wait for it to

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,200
work but if you tell if you put a little

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,150
file an SD card that tells it you're

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,260
going headless then when you boot up IP

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:30,110
address 172 not 60 tells your IP address

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:37,070
and then wednesday and then actually

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:40,700
flashes without the leds on the pie okay

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,900
you can stop now I do kind of like him I

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,400
could listen to him all day i love that

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,480
the PI turns out to be British who knew

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,660
she's gonna get the pie to redeliver

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,430
email no I'm gonna get him to read off

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,870
IRC like the meetings I'm just gonna

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,250
have that guy that seems like a bell

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:57,080
I'll tell people what channel she hangs

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:59,300
out in later yeah so no um so very boot

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,000
Barry boot came out in February somebody

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,040
said the PI needs a bootloader oh look

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,440
let's make it easy for you were you

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,990
reading about it earlier do anything it

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,940
basically is a very minimal environment

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,040
that draws that box and as a boot loader

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:21,590
so for all of you people who love

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:24,500
bootloaders boot loader so there's an

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,110
arm installer utility that was was done

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,680
by fedora but it should run anywhere and

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,960
Debian has one as well and it's just a

00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,490
graphical way you can say this is why SD

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,440
card this is the image I want to put on

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,360
it or pick one from the drop-down box

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,560
and it will go ahead and do the Guv DD

00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,810
out to the SD card but again like I said

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,420
you can just use DD if you're feeling

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,040
dangerous and brave yeah but pretty

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,470
graphical installer does it all for its

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,850
super easy it really so if we're going

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,200
to talk about select falls and things it

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,490
seems to work better for me if you go

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,780
ahead and download the image it claims

00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,440
that it will go out and get it for you

00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,850
and half

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,009
it will or you could just download the

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,980
image and point it to it there are no

00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:05,269
bugs they're never bugs I tell you what

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,730
to do on a Mac but I assume you're all

00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:09,440
using linux and don't eat it yeah but

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,169
there are there are raspberry pi builder

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,629
similar things for max and and then very

00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,159
boot you can do that or like I said you

00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,590
could just buy a pre-loaded card with

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,450
any of a number of things and we're told

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,679
you know when real soon now element14

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,690
right and a whole bunch of other people

00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,690
are going to start selling a multiboot

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:32,629
SD card with rasmi and weezy and pie

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:37,100
dora and something else i believe

00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:39,139
they're calling it the noobs SD card but

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,970
that's awesome cuz then the noobs can

00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:42,919
well I guess the noobs have to pick but

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,649
maybe they'll all pic by door it'll be

00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,559
fantastic let's talk about power it's

00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:50,509
bad boy is 5 volts unlike your Arduino

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,830
toys and this is a really good reason

00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,120
why all of you with iphone should go buy

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,889
android phones because if you had an

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,840
android phone you already have a PI

00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:59,899
power supply because that's what it uses

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,340
is that little micro USB slot your

00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:03,200
laptop's USB port isn't going to work

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,960
that is not going to power it but you

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,879
can get the jazzy little power bricks

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,009
that are handy at conferences to power

00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,970
your phone when they die right in the

00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,019
middle to party and you want to take a

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,059
picture somebody doing something stupid

00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:15,769
and you just plug a little power brick

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,710
and that will power the PI to you it's a

00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,909
handy dandy power supply you should not

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,159
you look like you want to add something

00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:24,200
I was just going to say that you know to

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,759
get a little lower level on y 5 volts is

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,240
important here the pie is extremely

00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,769
sensitive to a voltage drop and you

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,809
really want to give it as clean of a

00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:36,679
power and as much of a power as you can

00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:40,279
because if the power drops it just turns

00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,299
off yeah and you have two USB ports but

00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,649
you're gonna want to hub and you're

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,029
gonna want a powered hub even though we

00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,470
haven't plugged this one end so I sound

00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:47,269
like I'm lying yeah we don't have very

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:57,700
much draw coming off of the PI right now

00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:57,700
so all right

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,990
300 milliamps yeah what was he he asked

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:11,360
he asked what was the current draw on it

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:13,700
and the answer is 300 milliamps yes you

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,809
want u 1 a 1 amp mostly mostly you're

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,759
good power supplies are going to be

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,250
wanting up but if you're having problems

00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,690
like if you think huh my paw is not

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,279
coming on maybe you should check your

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,509
power supply so you know don't go to the

00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,399
dollar store and buy the cheapest

00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,529
android charger they have it's probably

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:28,909
not the best a lot of the early reports

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:30,500
about wireless devices not working

00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:33,769
properly we're entirely due to them

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,509
drawing way too much power and the Pied

00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,710
saying okay I'm only going to give you

00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:38,450
the bare minimum that I have left to

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,100
keep myself afloat and those devices

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:55,879
just going I don't see what I'm doing

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:57,200
right I'm not working yep a scroot is

00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,429
awesome I always sound like I am a

00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,990
commercial for Adafruit and they're

00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:01,429
giving me no money they like as much

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,629
stuff as I bought although if you spend

00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:07,549
300 hours you get a free Raspberry Pi so

00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:10,220
what the person with the person the

00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,419
audience was saying is that is that the

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,340
power supplies that they come with

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:15,200
phones and tablets and things tend to

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,029
not give you the sort of draw that you

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,509
want you want to try and get a really

00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:22,309
nice one that's specifically rated at a

00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:24,139
five volts one amp or close to it and

00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:25,820
you can get that from Adafruit they have

00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:28,399
an excellent cheap one cheap in price

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,750
not quality yeah yeah nice doesn't also

00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,919
have to be expensive and so then the

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,029
last bullet point for those of you who

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,259
have not yet played with a pie I was

00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,330
going to try to look this up except we

00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:37,490
plugged it into a bunch of things if you

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,049
can see right by the power slot there's

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,580
this cool little silver cylinder it

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,710
looks really neat doesn't that's not a

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,960
thumb holder for plugging in your power

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,639
cord it looks like it is but then that's

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,860
how just about everybody who plays with

00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:51,769
a pie breaks it off and it's the little

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,450
capacitor that is for this whole power

00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:55,909
situation and your pie will can almost

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,500
certainly continue to work but if you

00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:59,419
decide to solder a new and on this is

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,460
the term that you'll need to google and

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,490
you've now voided your warranty just

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,830
don't break it up so the pie has a

00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,850
little series of LEDs and they're a

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,250
little different if you have a

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,090
significantly older when they a changed

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,700
a bit but the l

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,040
tell you all kinds of things and this is

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,610
a lot of information but it's all on the

00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,110
internets that a linux org so much

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,050
Raspberry Pi information highly useful

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:26,300
but when you plug it in and go what

00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,680
didn't happen the LEDs tell you what

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,060
didn't happen red light means your power

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,830
supply sucks or you didn't plug it in

00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,800
because you drank too much at the self

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,080
party last night and and then the others

00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,030
have to do with the files that it needs

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,560
to find on the SD card in order to boot

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,290
and whether or not it found them there

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,730
are four files that it needs to find

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,800
rainbow screen means your firmware is

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:49,520
loaded but nothing else did it's pretty

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,370
though so let's talk about we talked a

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,660
little bit about gpio g pi gpio stands

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,920
for general purpose and it out and

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,900
that's what it is it's general purpose

00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,520
you this is what makes the PI awesome

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,680
you can make it do cool other things

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,790
because you have all of these pins but

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,860
then you look at those pins and if

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:08,090
you've looked at the pyre like I'm going

00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,440
I need a map and so the sky has created

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,600
this thing called the raspberry leaf

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,610
which quite possibly is one of the most

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,430
ingenious things anybody has fun with

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:18,320
the Raspberry Pi you print it out you

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,200
cut around the little rectangle you lay

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,860
it on the GPIO look I know what number

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,910
all your pins are I'm so distracted by

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,940
the raspberry leaf I can't say anything

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:34,700
useful about gpio would you like to sure

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:36,110
so gpio basically the pins some of the

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,950
pins have special meetings I'm not going

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,480
to spend a whole lot of time talking

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,370
about the special meetings on the pins

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,680
but basically the nice thing about the

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,410
GPIO pins is that you can directly wire

00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,540
them into other things and then control

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,160
them manually from user space either

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,370
using one of the libraries that are out

00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,610
there in C C++ Python Perl or you can

00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:58,760
actually directly bit bang them to life

00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,200
through / cysts you just create little

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,790
nodes for each one of the pins and you

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,500
tell it if its input or output and then

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,290
you start you know cat and commands at

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:10,550
it and it does things so what we've got

00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:12,590
wired up here today is a breadboard is

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:15,140
wired to the GPIO i'm actually using all

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:19,490
of the general input/output pins without

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:22,150
remapping anything yeah this is why you

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,150
should sin the back

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,320
this is like the most basic thing you

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,000
could possibly do with a pie stick some

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,080
LEDs into a breadboard make him go

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,490
blinky Thank You mana so what I've done

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,910
is I've wired up with a simple push

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:42,020
button switch to it I've got one two

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:44,299
three four five one color leds and one

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,860
tricolor LED and I just wrote a little

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,330
Python script to listen for the input

00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,549
from the switch and to trigger it to

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,990
walk the colors up and down that last

00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:54,950
led keeps coming loose and that's why

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,090
it's not lighting and then the it's

00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,980
going to do a snake thing and then it's

00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,390
going to cycle its color it's three

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,030
colors up and down and then it's going

00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,309
to do the full spectrum fade now the way

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,049
that that RGB LED works if you know

00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,270
electronics at all is that it's a

00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:11,120
cathode anode LED it has four pins

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,530
instead of two and the way that you

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
cycle it up and down is using something

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:17,960
called pulse width modulation now a lot

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,850
of the embedded hardware has pulse width

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,549
modulation hardware support across all

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,260
the pins the Raspberry Pi does not the

00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:26,450
Raspberry Pi has one pin that does

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,000
hardware pulse width modulation but

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,040
never fear the software library for

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,110
python has software support for pulse

00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:38,419
width modulation both width modulation

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:40,370
and so I used that to do the fades and

00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:41,840
the transitions you just basically tell

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,490
it to clock up and clock down on the

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,590
increments you want and shove it in the

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,990
loop and there you go pretty shiny bling

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,179
keys but this is just to demonstrate

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,510
that any sort of wiring concept that you

00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:55,580
need that is in the 33 or five volt

00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,169
range you can do it actually has a pin

00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,630
out for five volt but I recommend that

00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:00,679
you start small with your projects

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,059
because there's a lot of people that

00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,900
discover very quickly as they try to

00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:07,040
draw 5 volt off the pie that the pi just

00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,140
runs out of power and turns us off off

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,059
so you want to be careful with those

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,250
projects it is possible to do that you

00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:17,240
can also do fun things like actually

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:19,820
supply power to the PI over gpio as

00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,940
opposed to over the mini USB but that is

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,860
an excellent way to cook your pie and

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:28,130
there's no overvoltage protection to

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:31,669
recover that yeah it if you passed power

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:34,040
back through the GPIO it has no safeties

00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,519
like it does in the mini USB connector

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:42,849
which is why the pi just goes poof magic

00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:45,190
smoke so it does your chapter just keep

00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:46,299
talking all right building a cross

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,320
compiler so one of the first things

00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,609
you're going to discover when you say

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,989
okay I'm going to get this i'm going to

00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:51,190
put a little mp3 player on it and go

00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:52,629
play me some tunes it's going to be good

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,299
times and then you're like holy crap

00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:56,139
this thing is compiling forever so what

00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:58,119
you want to do is you want to build a

00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:59,709
cross compiler I a lot of the

00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,349
distributions already have arm cross

00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:03,729
compilers pre-built don't bother you're

00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:04,959
not going to get the best optimize case

00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,979
for the Raspberry Pi you're gonna want

00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:09,820
to build your cross compiler from

00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:11,229
scratch now back in Marv Dave now when i

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,989
started doing cross compilers first

00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:15,579
which is a long long time ago it was a

00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:17,769
much more involved process that it was

00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:20,289
full of profanity and screaming and

00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:22,299
throwing things but some nice gentlemen

00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,349
and ladies built a tool called cross

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,579
tool ng and crossed ong gives you the

00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:29,320
wonderfully bad user experience you get

00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:31,599
from the end curses colonel

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,889
configuration menu but it's a reasonably

00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,089
straightforward process where you tell

00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:36,029
it what you're trying to optimize for

00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:38,859
and your targets and your hardware and

00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:40,209
then it goes through insurance and build

00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,559
you a cross compiler and then that cross

00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:43,179
compiler is set up with the default

00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,200
optimization flags for the hardware that

00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:48,519
you set so you can take this then sit it

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,469
out you get an arm cross calm power

00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,359
that's optimized for the pie for the

00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:53,829
best case and then you just build all

00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:55,779
your code with that using sort of

00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:57,809
standard cross-compile techniques so

00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:00,549
let's say you want to build a colonel i

00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:01,690
want to build a colonel all right you

00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:04,059
just get your kernel source from the

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,529
upstream you pass a cross compiler to it

00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,849
the Linux kernel already understands

00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:09,279
cross compilers it's not going to be too

00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,869
confused by this and then the resulting

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,519
kernel that you build much much much

00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:14,169
much much faster than you would on there

00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,639
as grape I you get it done on your

00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:17,829
machine you copied over on your SD card

00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:20,159
you shove it in Walla new kernel I

00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:22,839
should totally compile on the PI right

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,059
yeah well maybe if you're bored or you

00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:29,649
need an excuse to tell your boss I still

00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:31,599
building I since yesterday I work Hoffy

00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:34,749
you said you wanted LibreOffice on this

00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,339
thing right I mean so I while he did

00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:38,619
that I use my psychic powers to put your

00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:40,029
thoughts on my next slide where you just

00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:41,649
want to see cool things people did with

00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:44,820
it what are make people make it besides

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:48,070
plugging LEDs into it making them blink

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,230
cases good place to start because so I

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,150
was talking about cases went

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,400
I'm and somebody said well it comes with

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,080
a great k so I'm like where she fires

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,970
from he's like no the cardboard box i

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,720
just cut little holes in the sides to

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:04,330
flex thank you that is an option or you

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,549
could 3d print one or you could 3d print

00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:09,970
one well that was excellent timing good

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,950
work or you could build a fantastic went

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,200
out of Legos which is not bigger on the

00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,360
inside indeed you can buy one everybody

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,040
sells cases some of them better than

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,350
others like the one that comes in that

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,940
maker shed $150 kit i was mentioning

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:26,470
kind of just a crap but there are lots

00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,150
of them for about 10 bucks that are

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:31,270
really nice or you can people have built

00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:35,130
some really fantastic really nice cases

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:39,040
I opted to steal my children's Legos and

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:42,880
did and perhaps bit too much research

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,040
into how Lego should happen so a Lego

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,570
square is 8 millimeters on each side and

00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,360
if you figure out how big the PI you

00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,250
need a baseboard that is 9 by 13 there's

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,780
no such thing as a nine by 13 Lego

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,390
baseboard we don't want a giant one and

00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,070
let well we'll get to that so I started

00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,870
doing these are configurations of two

00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,429
layers of half height Lego so that you

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:05,260
can make your own baseboard to build up

00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:08,050
on the pie or you could just buy a kit

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,700
that somebody already designed and I'll

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,379
put the slides online you can grab that

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,730
or you can just you google the daily

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:14,919
break the Raspberry Pi Lego case it

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:17,080
comes up but so the thing with this i

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,149
mentioned i may have been a little too

00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,980
involved in the whole lego thing this

00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,590
costs 14 pounds you have to order it

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,050
from over the ocean which is say $21 ish

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,960
there are 87 bricks which comes out to

00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,760
24 cents per brick and it's quite

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,350
possible that at some point i had a

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,149
little too much time on my hands and

00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,520
compared the price per brick and a

00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:38,139
variety of sets as compared to going to

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,909
the lego store and compile it so you

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,490
should get below ten cents per brick and

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,929
this is 24 cents per brick so really you

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,859
could break into your kids lego stash

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,710
you're going to do a heck of a lot

00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:50,470
better you can get the little hinge door

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,970
pieces to put over all of the ports if

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,970
you want to make a super snazzy one

00:34:54,140 --> 00:35:00,600
I've left the star wars sets intact i am

00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:02,550
only using loose legos i swear if you

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,720
use transparent bricks over the leds you

00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,160
can still see what they're doing when

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,830
you use the crappy power supply it's a

00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,030
fascist but the last thing that I swear

00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,040
will say about legos we could talk about

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:13,050
this all afternoon it's going to be

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,220
uneven because the legos are uneven the

00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,510
bottom the paws on even it's a little

00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,180
shaky so there's this awesome stuff

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,920
called Subaru su GRU and you can make

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,350
little sugru nubbins to go in there and

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,430
you have a fabulous even case although

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,660
if you do buy this one you get the

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:32,910
little you gets a little raspberry on

00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:36,810
top and that's kind of cute yeah oh well

00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:39,810
see that's a whole other we'll talk

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,520
moving on we'll have a chat afterwards

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,530
no but if you would like to google this

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,300
information so I blog for a site called

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,520
geek mom if you google geek mom lego

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,020
prices i have a chart comparing the

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,060
price for brick upset since the

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,090
beginning of lego you can read all about

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,740
price per brick but aim for lower than

00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,940
ten cents per brick that's my advice the

00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,950
first step is admitting you have a

00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:03,870
problem so he said the first thing he

00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,760
wanted to do was a touch screen the

00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,580
first thing i wanted to do was crammed

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,350
all of this stuff in an old gameboy case

00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:12,150
the first problem you have with this is

00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,650
not the time you screen which Adafruit

00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,290
cells god they really should give me

00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,030
some kickbacks the first problem is that

00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,220
key boy cases are screwed together with

00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,440
tri tip screws who has one of these

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,460
things she does you should come on

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,280
everyone in the room has that

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,720
screwdriver but us know we were in the

00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,920
red hat office where all the engineers

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,540
are and you would think we could be able

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,430
to find a tri tip screwdriver it didn't

00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,870
go well so i actually i got a drill like

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,240
I drilled out the holes to pry the

00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,100
screws out but yeah so this is it hacked

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,780
together I haven't quite crammed it back

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,130
into the case because the joystick i

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,770
bought was too big to get through that

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,600
hole but found a teeny tiny joystick

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,830
that may or may not work on Anna fruit

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,510
going to add sugru which I mentioned

00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,730
with Legos to that to make an actual

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,500
little you have an idea I'm open to

00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,330
Joystiq ideas here we can talk about the

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,480
buttons but you can see it totally works

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,350
and even better this screen is so nice

00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,970
when we did this he was on the other

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,530
side of the room he's like read me the

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,240
IP address that screen is two and a half

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,280
inches the size of the Game Boy screen I

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,999
was like are you unhinged but know that

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,259
screen is where

00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:09,299
be nice i totally read the little IP

00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:12,269
address off there so I've been calling

00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:14,219
this pie boy if you add a p 2 pi boy you

00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:18,659
get somebody else had the idea of a

00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:20,309
fallout pip-boy and so somebody totally

00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:23,699
built this he's like this is my

00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:25,529
halloween costume raspberry pitboy it

00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,449
didn't make it the whole night is this

00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:30,209
oh no this is the still intact version

00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:31,319
oh it's really hard to see it suffered

00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:32,699
it didn't make it through the night so

00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:34,619
he's working on rebuilding it but he did

00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,629
a really good job and so you can you can

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,279
go to his blog there and and check out

00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:41,399
the whole Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi

00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:42,719
pitboy pit pot yeah anyway but it died

00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:46,049
might have had something to do that

00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:48,479
bottle of vodka is holding the next

00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:52,109
thing we did was start emulating games

00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:54,329
and this was awesome for us you can you

00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,599
can buy USB versions of all the old

00:37:54,329 --> 00:38:00,059
controllers to play all sorts of things

00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:04,829
and so we went to maker faire in New

00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:06,239
York last fall and it's huge it's what a

00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:08,039
hundred thousand people or something and

00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,449
we'll get to the part in a matter where

00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:10,799
we had a Raspberry Pi photo booth and

00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:12,059
this guy was in a really hot penguin

00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:14,879
suit you may have seen him your last

00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:16,469
year and so occasionally you take off

00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:18,179
the penguin suit and kids will come back

00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,309
we would set up Mario so people could

00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:21,419
have something to do in our booth

00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:23,339
inevitably this is what happens every

00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:24,839
single time I can't would come by say 11

00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:26,489
or talking to be like oh is that Mario

00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,929
can tell you're Mario you're like hey

00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:30,449
you can play my mari come every back

00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:31,679
it's mario 2 so you start out with that

00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,819
little tower thing and you have to

00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,889
figure out how to get down and get to

00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:38,819
the next level 2 seconds you're Mario

00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:41,099
sucks yeah it inevitably inevitably

00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:44,489
child walks up is this the new mario no

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:46,289
yes yes it is no it's not yeah they're

00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:49,559
uh oh don't talk about the meme emulator

00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:52,439
cuz it's a little different yes and sure

00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,399
hands buddy knows what mame is ok we

00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:58,919
don't even talk about we can do that on

00:38:53,399 --> 00:39:00,359
the pie like I said repeatedly the the

00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,739
pie was designed for education the

00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,689
reason it is named Raspberry Pi is

00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:07,709
because it was meant to teach Python oh

00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:09,419
ho and so there are two super awesome

00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:11,009
books for doing this the first is good

00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,089
for teaching kids programming skills in

00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,499
general and that's what this is a

00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:15,359
picture from it's called super Scratch

00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:16,469
programming adventure and I imagine when

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,500
many of you are familiar with scratch

00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:22,020
but if you're not you can see here

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,640
uses these little puzzle pieces and the

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,020
the bits of programming fit in the

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,400
puzzle pieces so the kids see how it

00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,600
fits together my seven-year-old can do

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,830
it that's the kind of skill level we're

00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,570
talking if you can read you can probably

00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,490
handle scratch and so the way this book

00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,200
does it is the left side as a page of a

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,940
comic book and then the right side

00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,930
you're solving whatever has happened in

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,640
the comic book you're solving their

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,780
problems by making a program and at the

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,490
end of the book you have a video game

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,740
you can play and what's cooler when your

00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,060
kids and make it your own video game the

00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,700
other book that's really awesome for

00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,530
this is called Python for kids and I

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,410
believe I'm not I haven't checked this

00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,790
in a while but if you go to the no

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,890
starch website you could get thirty

00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,930
percent off of both of these with rpi as

00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,460
the code for Raspberry Pi which is

00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,600
pretty cool dit and and I don't get

00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,040
anything from them either i just know

00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,870
they're cool books I have them I get ten

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,420
percent how do I get in on that deal

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:11,550
there is a PI store this launched back

00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,710
in December and it the goal of this was

00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,750
to get kids programming it's built on in

00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,640
d city and so it uses their content

00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,200
ratings there's a cool thing on there

00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,700
called raspberry invaders that's kind of

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,170
like space invaders and it teaches kids

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,450
to build a game because again what do

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,770
kids want but to build a game and then

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,230
it also teaches them all those

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,230
open-source econ concepts like sharing

00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,150
and there you can have licenses on here

00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,440
it's super familiar to kids who already

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:38,010
know how to go to the Google Play Store

00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,200
the iTunes or steam or whatever but they

00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,880
start to learn those concepts of reviews

00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,710
and checking something out before you

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,240
buy it and all those extra skills

00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:49,470
besides just the programming stuff it's

00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:52,560
pretty cool the next thing I decided I

00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:54,750
wanted to do was back a long long time

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,070
ago I was running the you know do you

00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,210
remember the old study at home screen

00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,290
saver you would run the little screen

00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,460
saver and hope that maybe you found

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,690
something i love how many heads are

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,090
nothing yeah I had that screensaver

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:05,900
that's good times well so they kind of

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:09,210
scrapped that project and it was reborn

00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:12,120
in a new version but you can just

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,570
totally dedicate a pie to hunting for

00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:19,020
aliens the project still going why not

00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:21,300
or you could have a pie farm of them

00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,920
hunting for aliens and you could build

00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:28,610
your pie farm on a lego board because

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:31,890
you can get a 50 by 50 brick Lego for I

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,660
you know I I haven't actually done that

00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,430
but

00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,780
okay so I'm going to go home I mean a

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,920
build a pie farm on a lego board i'm

00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,539
going to tape those little pictures of

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,680
pies on top of each one of them and the

00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:43,549
next time I do this I'll have a picture

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,430
just for you deal all right another guy

00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:47,809
who is dedicated to nerdom has decided

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,910
he knew it needs to build a raspberry pi

00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:56,210
star gate what is this man has dedicated

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:59,210
some serious attention to detail if you

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,099
go to his his wordpress page the

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,569
attention he has paid to the little

00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:04,069
markings all the way around the Stargate

00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm afraid somebody's going to tell him

00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:09,289
it might not work yeah he has a he's a

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,599
he's a request for people to send him

00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:20,750
knack with us so it's a entirely

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:23,750
possible pi FM is a sassy little project

00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,970
that turns your pie into an FM radio you

00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,859
can play sounds out of it to a radio

00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,289
which you should you know check your

00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:33,680
local laws before amplifying in a

00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:36,470
significant fashion but it uses the the

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,150
pies on board clock manager and uses it

00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,920
to produce whatever frequency you like

00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,210
with all sorts of math that you don't

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,130
have to understand to use it you just

00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:47,119
follow their fantastic direction it uses

00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,029
one of the GPIO pins as an antenna yeah

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,130
he says it works to about 10 feet unless

00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:56,109
you add an extra antenna yeah which is

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:59,559
which is a piece of wire tied to the pin

00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:02,480
yeah it's very fancy very high-tech oh

00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,430
look I did the math for you hey are you

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,700
all excited about the math oh okay we

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,529
could go back to the Lego TARDIS I

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,839
mentioned we did a photo booth that's

00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:14,750
that's me in the foreground and talks

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,890
here in the background this this

00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,630
actually might have been the actual

00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:20,990
first thing we did with the Raspberry Pi

00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,730
but it runs on a super simple little

00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,440
Python script that uses G photo to

00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:27,440
detect your camera and you press enter

00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,640
and it produces well your picture for

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,799
one it takes your picture with the

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,630
penguin and then outputs it to the

00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:35,750
screen with this little web page and so

00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,069
you scan your QR code and you get to

00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,680
download your picture but then also may

00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:41,270
be here about how fantastic fedoras or

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,630
you know whatever else you under put in

00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,630
that web page

00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:51,559
what most people seem to do with it is

00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:53,720
build an XBMC well home theater system

00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,690
it and it seems to work fine for that

00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,150
you've done that yes I mean it's

00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:02,180
powerful up because the CP unit isn't

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,460
powerful enough to do real-time decoding

00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,869
but the hardware itself because it's

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,480
using a system-on-a-chip has dedicated

00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:11,690
harder resources to do specific file

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,079
types and codec types by default it

00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,760
comes with support for h.264 so it can

00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,910
decode that out of the box you can buy a

00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,250
couple other codec support and basically

00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,450
you pass a little key to the firmware I

00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,740
know that sounds really old school and

00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:27,349
proprietary but that's how it works and

00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,650
then it enables the hardware to natively

00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:32,630
decode other formats so you don't have

00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,640
to actually have the CPU doing anything

00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,450
its decoding that in hardware which is

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,789
very fast and then it just pipes it over

00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:44,599
HDMI and we've demonstrated it doing

00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:48,109
full full screen a 1080p encoded quality

00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:51,849
video with no delay with no stutter at

00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:56,299
all and will it function as a Stargate

00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:58,880
only if you have an aqueduct so that's a

00:44:56,299 --> 00:45:01,640
that's a some of the great examples they

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,589
have a couple more but I feel like at

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,510
this point the last time I did this a

00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:08,270
couple of you were like I don't know any

00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:10,910
of the acronyms you said for the last 20

00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,950
minutes and I'm horrified so I found

00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,539
this little snippet can you do this this

00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,309
guy that may be really hard to read

00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,950
especially in the back but this was a

00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:20,329
comment on the Raspberry Pi wiki I think

00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,099
and he said within three minutes I've

00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:24,109
opened a package containing my pi found

00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,660
an SD card in a drawer googled Raspberry

00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,700
Pi XBMC installed at raspbmc on the card

00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,990
booted it and it works he says I haven't

00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,400
even figured out who's behind it but

00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,890
whoever you are I love you it's easy

00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,910
like anybody can do this and then the

00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,230
stuff you don't know you learn you

00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:40,299
figure it out you learned about mr.

00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:42,980
clean a few people have wanted to put

00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:45,289
android on their raspberry PI's which I

00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,990
still think is a mysterious choice and

00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:50,270
yet everyone's has valid choices to make

00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:54,279
in life so it is possible to run

00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:56,690
cyanogenmod 72 it's not awesome

00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:58,910
cyanogenmod 9 is not usable

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,790
at all but if you're interested in this

00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:04,130
it's Raz droid razr ID is their channel

00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:06,819
and they'll totally help you do that

00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:09,200
keep in mind that arm v6 is slow and old

00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:11,089
yeah this is not a recommended option

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,440
but it is theoretically possible which

00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:13,849
actually applies to a lot of Raspberry

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,770
Pi projects this is not the best idea

00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,020
you've ever had but what the heck it's

00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:20,210
just off a star game it's $35 go kill it

00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,119
why not let's cram video a gameboy case

00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:26,839
we don't have anything else going on

00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:29,089
this is the the Arduino bet that i

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,990
mentioned i did is it called ice cream

00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:34,130
is that whatever i think it is and so

00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:38,240
you just slap it on you can use the

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:41,000
arduino shields like so this is my

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,589
favorite best Valentine's gift ever this

00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,470
year for Valentine's get day this guy

00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:48,440
made his girlfriend a bilingual r2d2

00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:50,089
that uses face recognition it has motion

00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,010
and distance detection and it records

00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:56,680
and plays back messages it's an actual

00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,680
little functioning r2d2 that guy wins

00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:02,710
that's it it's a it's pie ala mode is

00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:07,390
the neighbor that's why I said ice cream

00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:11,089
sometimes by the end of your slides yeah

00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:13,369
this guy has tinier fingers than I do so

00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:15,650
you can see the lighter for scale and

00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:18,140
the teeny tiny little arcade machine

00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:21,319
like I thought crammed into a gameboy

00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:24,770
was a crazy idea it's a it's a arcade

00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:29,660
cabinet France yeah for your ant farm

00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:32,150
that's a bad idea and finally fish fly

00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,950
this is actually a reasonably functional

00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,440
use of the Raspberry Pi that's actually

00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:38,690
being used for research it it's used to

00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,460
guide and control solar powered surface

00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:44,500
vehicle on the water and you can see

00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,500
their high-tech waterproofing tupperware

00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:51,280
I was very disappointed it was not used

00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:53,110
to mind control fish and this is what I

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,610
want to build next and yeah so this was

00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,350
one of those this is my lesson with

00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:59,290
raspberry pi as soon as I have the idea

00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:01,300
I should totally build an ex I google

00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:05,050
raspberry pi x and discover somebody

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,180
else already did it and so we we were at

00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,010
a food con in Paris back in the fall and

00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,500
went to the world's greatest bar which I

00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,210
could totally tell you about later in

00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,580
they had this old do you remember these

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,750
old arcade cabinets i call it the pizza

00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,880
hut table because the only place I ever

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,080
saw them but it flips the game player 1

00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,940
player 2 with the person sitting across

00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,950
from you like we could totally build

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,450
this with the Raspberry Pi raspberry pie

00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,250
pizza hut table which apparently is what

00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:30,210
other people call it to you there it is

00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:34,270
coffee table pie playing Donkey Kong

00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:36,040
Pizza Hut table so that's my list of

00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,610
cool projects and that's a few resources

00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,260
you can hit for making your own awesome

00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,640
stuff which I if you've already built

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,560
awesome stuff like there's a fan on your

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,350
pie that's still pretty cool we'd love

00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,420
to hear about it adafruit has a massive

00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,070
wiki with all sorts of tutorials for how

00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,690
to do things eel Enix I've said a

00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,300
hundred times instructables has a few

00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,400
not quite as many beginners guide

00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,660
Raspberry Pi is already out that's an a

00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,920
Riley book that gets you started with

00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,410
the basic stuff and then theoretically

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,720
our hacks book comes out in August the

00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:14,710
internet tells me and that's where you

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:17,530
can find us any questions the class 10

00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:21,340
cards you just try a new card put that

00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:23,260
one in your camera yeah basically no I

00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:28,930
thought they fix that bug though have

00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:32,730
you tried it yeah you know just try

00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,730
cards are cheap sketch a new card

00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,980
well it is it is but some it's somewhat

00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,870
harder if you're not ordering off the

00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,910
internet to get the older cards now

00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,740
because the stores are tending to carry

00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:51,860
the newer classics and higher cards just

00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:54,420
by default yeah I mostly use sixes yeah

00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,610
six of 10 in your camera it's better put

00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:04,050
to use there any way past pictures I

00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:06,870
might be a camera nerd instead that's

00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:08,820
what they intended but because it's a

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,710
full linux operating system environment

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:15,390
you can use whatever your heart feels

00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:17,460
like it's it's a tiny computer not

00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:20,010
really I mean some of the harbored

00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,360
specific stuff like the GPIO access for

00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,580
the Raspberry Pi there's a Raspberry Pi

00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,100
specific python module for accessing the

00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,420
GPIO pins that understands how it works

00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,820
and the labels and the special

00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,920
functionalities of it but aside from

00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,550
that sort of modular functionality add

00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:40,800
there really isn't any differentiator

00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:43,580
yeah what happens when you run it off

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,580
for Dora Corre

00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:54,010
so the original fedora remix for the

00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:57,310
Raspberry Pi there was a couple releases

00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:01,360
of that that was done by some students

00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:03,370
at Seneca College and it was just taking

00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,560
the previous arm builds for fedora they

00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,760
were armed v5 optimized and then

00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,370
combining them with some of the add-on

00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:12,430
software to do things like set the

00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:15,490
memory mappings and the resizing of the

00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:17,800
partition but it wasn't optimized for

00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:20,290
the pie and every little bit of

00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:23,770
optimization helps that little engine go

00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:25,690
faster so they stopped working on that

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,770
around the same time that Fedora

00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,530
announced they were going to drop

00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:31,630
support for arm v5 and started

00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:34,020
rebuilding all of the packages for arm

00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:36,610
v6 hard float with the specific Hardware

00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,890
Raspberry Pi optimizations and that's

00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:40,720
why that old one that was slow and not

00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,790
optimized stop being produced and the

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,860
new one which is called pedorra has the

00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,020
optimization is specific and really only

00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,160
going to work on the Raspberry Pi I also

00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,720
forgot to mention I was talking about

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,980
cool projects the big wooden thing on

00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,510
the table give to the microphone and let

00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:57,010
them this is so if you didn't see his

00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:58,120
talk yesterday this is the Alcyone going

00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:03,490
to explain about your midi controller

00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:05,290
it's a cool project okay fine it's

00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,870
basically a mini foot controller that's

00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:11,020
built with the pies using ITC it's

00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:13,230
actually written with with with C++ so

00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:15,940
it's you know python is not required

00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,700
it's actually very very fast even though

00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,470
the pie itself is very slow in terms of

00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,800
what you're used to working on a desktop

00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:25,870
or even a cheap laptop this thing crawls

00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,970
but the latency is actually easily will

00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,340
enough for live music it's been used on

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,410
stage you know worked fantastically as a

00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,790
controller I thought we should start

00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,990
this talk by using it to play the rains

00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,580
of castamere to make the Game of Thrones

00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:38,410
fans cry because that's what I like to

00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,620
do in my spare time but we didn't plug

00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,620
it in

00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:46,740
pardon me yes the schematics for this

00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,119
are online and I'm actually going to

00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:52,080
flush them out further so you can't

00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:55,349
actually do it yourself they're on my

00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,640
blog on nygma station com we should also

00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:58,890
be posting in mind community at

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,030
redhat.com and they will be theirs there

00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:04,520
will be an article language is indeed

00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:04,520
not redhead com soon shorter to remember

00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,890
absolutely whatever your rating any

00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:14,000
other questions I saw another hand did

00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:16,230
you change your mind forever went okay

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,349
well thanks for coming thank you very

00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,349
much

00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,979
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,930
ago we could not have imagined that

00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:36,150
asterisk would not only become the most

00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,279
widely adopted open source communication

00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:40,319
software on the planet but that it would

00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:42,839
impact the entire industry in the way

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,819
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:47,459
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:49,410
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:51,509
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,920
transition of power from the hands of

00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:55,170
the traditional proprietary phone

00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,569
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:59,640
administrators of phone systems using

00:53:57,569 --> 00:54:01,289
this power our customers have traded all

00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,390
sorts of business changing applications

00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:05,190
from small office phone systems to

00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,289
mission-critical call centers to

00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:09,119
international carrier networks in fact

00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,559
there's even an entire country those

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,839
communications infrastructure runs on

00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,969
esters the gym has always been about

00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:16,680
creating technology that expands

00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:18,839
communications capabilities in ways that

00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,039
we could never have imagined and that's

00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,440
part of what's game-changing about

00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:25,140
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,239
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,339
IP phones that extends control of the

00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,109
user all the way to the desktop the

00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:32,819
launch of these new products represents

00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:34,769
the next phase indigenous history of

00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:37,319
innovation these are the first and only

00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:39,029
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,559
power of Astra's when we first discussed

00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:42,599
our expectations for building a family

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,759
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,499
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:48,119
the team to build the phones such that

00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:50,339
they were easy to install integrate

00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,170
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:54,749
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,369
that goal user feedback is validating

00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:58,499
that when it comes to operation with

00:54:56,369 --> 00:55:00,900
astro space systems including our own

00:54:58,499 --> 00:55:03,479
Switchvox based product these are the

00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,799
easiest to use best integrated most

00:55:03,479 --> 00:55:07,380
interoperable products on the market

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,359
today the Digium family of phones will

00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:11,430
initially include three IP des hommes

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,380
uniquely designed to complement any

00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,239
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,910
these phones are different for a number

00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:20,549
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,989
designed for use with esters secondly

00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:23,430
we've made it really easy to

00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:26,009
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,079
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:30,029
to access information inside of asterisk

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,550
allowing tight coupling between an

00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:33,400
application

00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:35,380
and the phone additionally we've created

00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,570
an applications engineer that allows

00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,480
users and developers to create and run

00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:42,550
their own apps on the phone and finally

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,590
we've done all of this at a very

00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,300
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:48,070
always thinking of ways to give our

00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,440
customers the best value in business

00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:52,330
phone systems and also give them the

00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,490
power to create their own solutions or

00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,290
any communications challenge well

00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,060
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:00,100
to make astros cooler bastard more

00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,840
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,390
asterisk and communications even easier

00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:07,320
and together we'll change the way the

00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:07,320
world communication again

00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:50,130
your customers rely on your website or

00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,530
application if it's slower

00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:55,470
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:57,270
and costs you money keeping your

00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:00,770
business critical systems humming along

00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:03,110
requires insight into what they're doing

00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:05,060
your system metrics tells stories

00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:07,070
stories that can reveal performance

00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,410
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:10,970
other problems but how do you keep an

00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:13,610
eye on all of your systems performance

00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:16,640
metrics in real-time and record this

00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:18,620
data for later analysis enter longview

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,420
the new way to see what's really going

00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,580
on under the hood the long view

00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,650
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:27,110
of all your systems providing you with a

00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:30,470
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:33,050
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:34,820
load and network usage click a specific

00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:37,220
system to access its individual

00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,730
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:42,140
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,790
comprehensive network data including

00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:46,100
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:47,690
available on the network tab and disk

00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,610
rights and free space on the disk

00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:52,430
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:54,980
displays usage statistics for individual

00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:57,140
processes the system info tab shows

00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,390
listening services active connections

00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,520
and available updates adding long view

00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:03,230
to a system is easy just click the

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,360
button copy the one line installation

00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,820
command then run the command on your

00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,500
linux system to complete the process the

00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,690
agent will begin collecting data and

00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,490
sending it to longview then the graph

00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:16,100
start rolling

00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:18,470
use longview to gain visibility into

00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:22,210
your servers so when your website or app

00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:22,210
heats up it stays up

00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:45,050
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:47,210
way to better utilize all your resources

00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:50,660
and it makes managing all your resources

00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:54,490
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:58,010
happening in open source the

00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:59,810
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,730
of the community and the speed at which

00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,920
these are these you know these

00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:06,230
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,840
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:11,540
that really shows the power of the you

00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,160
know of the open source community it is

00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:17,360
global and it's definitely because of

00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:23,690
the users community people are extremely

00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:25,430
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,890
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,000
these guys helping each other out and

00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:31,910
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,740
manner the product is transparent for

00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:37,940
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:39,980
base everyone can see how cloud dark is

00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:45,830
is being built nothing nothing is

00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:48,470
proprietary everything is open in many

00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:52,670
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:56,450
unborn health cloudstack the most

00:59:52,670 --> 01:00:00,220
exciting event in recent memory for he

00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:03,010
was our first developer boot camp

01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:05,650
and our call gave people I gave me two

01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:09,609
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:13,780
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:16,630
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:19,150
chairs in the room twice everything

01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:22,390
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:25,480
is open source and so I don't think that

01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:27,220
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,250
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:32,980
computing and so i think it's i think

01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:34,330
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,440
about cloud computing you're really

01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:40,990
talking about open source cloud

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:44,140
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:46,540
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:50,440
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:53,109
each data centers these hardware is

01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:56,590
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:59,290
to handle number one that mass scale

01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:02,470
number two it's designed to handle the

01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:05,349
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:07,960
deployments started working on contact

01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:11,080
over four years ago

01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:13,660
it was the original set of people

01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,849
working on it had a background of

01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:19,660
delivering software telcos and service

01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:24,040
providers lots of QA lots of users

01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:27,190
actually using it high availability is

01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:30,760
the key feature multiple hypervisors

01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:33,190
support different network models we can

01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,230
pick up whatever suits you better while

01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:39,160
step management server can be deployed

01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:40,960
in different physical machines it

01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,580
definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,980
being deployed everywhere there's a

01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:49,720
major movie studio that they were using

01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:52,930
cloudstack they were using it to

01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:55,119
transcode video and I thought that was

01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:56,410
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,680
fascinating is what they did during

01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:02,470
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,849
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:05,770
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:09,910
the instances and go back to doing real

01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:11,230
work cloudstack is vast it touches so

01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:13,300
many different aspects and there's no

01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:15,700
one person that's kind of like a master

01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:19,780
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:22,119
as a project is going to be one of the

01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:26,080
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:31,510
most feature fallen and and robust

01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:34,440
platforms help Taylor Adams senior

01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,440
living through the clouds dag

01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:52,339
most enterprises today realize that

01:02:50,059 --> 01:02:53,989
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:56,359
enough to keep their networks saved from

01:02:53,989 --> 01:02:58,429
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:00,469
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:02:58,429 --> 01:03:02,599
popular lately that adds that extra

01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:05,269
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:07,039
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:03:05,269 --> 01:03:09,229
know is that some two-factor

01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,449
authentication solutions they're better

01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:14,509
than others like two-factor strong

01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:16,759
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:03:14,509 --> 01:03:18,739
beyond other authentication systems by

01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:21,799
being less expensive easier to implement

01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:24,259
and easier to use giving software-based

01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:27,109
token clients built to run on all major

01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:29,709
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:32,059
Android these tokens utilize a

01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:34,279
public/private key combination that's

01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:36,409
generated and on device so there aren't

01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:38,929
any shared secrets flying around or

01:03:36,409 --> 01:03:41,779
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:43,669
special handling instead all keys are

01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:46,130
kept secure and private between the

01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:48,319
requesting token and your server which

01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,929
