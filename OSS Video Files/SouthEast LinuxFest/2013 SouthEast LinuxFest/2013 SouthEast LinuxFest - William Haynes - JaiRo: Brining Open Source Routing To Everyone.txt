the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,869
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,539
possible everyone I want to thank you so

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,059
much for thank you so much for coming to

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,399
be talking about gyro today which is an

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,629
open source project that's by technology

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,809
is is sponsoring and games started with

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:45,539
we're just we're just launching this

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,340
project and one of the things that we

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,430
want here at this conference was to find

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,809
like-minded individuals we've already

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,600
just been just really humbled by the

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,280
amount of interests and people stopping

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,170
by the booths and stuff like that and

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,300
see some faces here that look familiar

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,280
from conversations we've had the booth

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,850
that I appreciate you taking your time

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,220
here to here come our vision and where

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,200
we plan on going with this thing kind of

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,850
why the concept is a bit and I want to

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,920
make sure we have an opportunity for

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,900
people to ask ask questions and the

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,500
networking guiana have been for a long

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:30,720
time I actually went to Technical

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,409
College back in back in a TA one time

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,900
frame at Midlands Technical in Columbia

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:42,560
but over time I became a teacher and

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:45,810
then came back into computing in 2010

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,110
November 2010 got laid off and he

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,360
started with stumpy we're based in

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,180
simpsonville south carolina we sell

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,960
specialized wireless routers especially

00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,700
right now VPN so VPN client routers with

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,380
the ability for you to create

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,230
individualized gateways for the devices

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:14,170
on your on your network

00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:16,850
we started off as dd-wrt folks but

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,430
supporting dd-wrt in the field was

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,650
really difficult because boy you'd hit

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,120
the reset button and all the configs and

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,430
everything you've done the scripts

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,090
everything that you've got underlying is

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,210
gone and so spring 2011 we hired our

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:36,560
first programmer in fall 2011 we

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:39,140
released our first firmware and we're

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,230
currently on version 5 we've got 10

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:50,300
employees here we ship worldwide every

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:52,880
day and Lolo actually if you could bring

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,770
one of the accelerator units and like

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,320
that whole unit because I wanted to be

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,150
able to show that off so I've got

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:04,490
networking background back in the old

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:09,680
old days I remember installing a altos

00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:12,800
unit in malden for an electron or

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,270
electric supply company it was one

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,300
multi-user mpm system and we ran serial

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,150
cable all over the building and to

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,530
connect the monitors and it's craziness

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,080
when I think back on and my most recent

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,750
kind of big networking gig was I worked

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,740
in Chicago for a couple of for a couple

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,630
of years selling Cisco networks for you

00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,950
know multinational companies and stuff

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:47,660
like that but for four years from 2004

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,880
to 2008 I was in Thailand and it was so

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,640
painful and so difficult to get

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,800
high-speed internet into my neighborhood

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,950
that once I had done it and crossed that

00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,250
big hump I started using dd-wrt to

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,530
create a neighborhood network so that

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,540
all the mission families and stuff I was

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,820
there with youth with a mission to make

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,670
sure that we could share that one that

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,590
one broadband internet so I got started

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,860
out with DD done

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,709
ERT and what happened was when I came

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,260
back from Thailand in 2008 guide job

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,830
right out of the gate is CIO of a

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,449
company in Greenville South Carolina but

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,540
when I got laid off one of the first

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,180
things that came to mind was that DD wrt

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,060
the things had done with that and I

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,030
realized there's a lot of people thank

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,290
you there's a lot of people who want the

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:44,710
results but don't necessarily want to be

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:48,970
a router hobbyist and that I started

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:53,410
looking for how do I bridge that gap so

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,479
our software development was on nips so

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,180
the typical router platform that you're

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:02,229
familiar with is running a mips chip

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:06,070
somewhere between 700 megahertz to 600

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:11,380
megahertz they have 32 megs of ram up to

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:13,300
about 128 they've and they've got eight

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,669
megs of flash some of them have four

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,130
mags of flash for the hard drive and

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:22,120
that goes up to about sixty four mags or

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,850
something like that last year we did our

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,479
first x86 project which was a VPN

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:33,639
accelerator which we built on a fit

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:37,210
Foxconn unit that was dual core atom 1.8

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:41,550
giga hertz two gigs of ram is what we

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,800
put in it with a four gig flash and then

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,260
now what we're looking is the gyro

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,590
project so I make sure I make it clear

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,729
here so by accountants to biotechnology

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,710
is a company and yes we need to make

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,590
money in all that kind of stuff but we

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,479
want to sponsor the world's best router

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:06,130
platform and we hope to make our money

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,740
selling and supporting in on hardware

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,770
and

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,360
and and basically being the solution for

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,910
people who don't want to be hobbyists

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,310
but we also want partner with the people

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:21,069
who are hobbyist or our developers and

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,539
in love working at the networking level

00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,539
so here's part of the thing that saw

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,069
limit early things when I you know when

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,110
I was in timely and working on the

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,050
dd-wrt I really didn't think about very

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,330
much but when I got laid off and started

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,580
taking a look at routers and and what

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,259
the routing need was out there that

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,139
wasn't being met because lots of people

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:44,659
were flashing with dd-wrt and the

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,039
question was why you know why are they

00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:47,930
doing this why are they spending their

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,250
time there's something they're trying to

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,960
accomplish that they couldn't do with

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,819
their links us firmware so I remember

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,720
you know that first day when we're

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,449
cracking open the box to trade e-brake

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,909
my first router that i bricked and all

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,819
the sudden i'm realizing this thing's

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:09,800
just a little computer it's got a cpu

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,270
it's got a hard drive that's just a

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,210
little piece of flash memory it's got

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,400
Ram you just sent him the video and the

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,900
keyboard but other than that it's just a

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,840
little computer and I don't know why I

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,509
didn't get that before you know we all

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,280
have route Roku's and smart TVs and we

00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:30,250
don't think of them as computers maybe

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,349
but that for me was a big revelation now

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:38,150
here's the opportunity that as I see it

00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:42,229
as a founder of a routing company in

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:45,819
2002 consumer networking was 125

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:52,849
megahertz CPU 16 megs of ram a for Meg

00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:55,880
for Meg flash today all those years

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:59,750
later we're looking at a 600 megahertz

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:04,490
CPU 128 megs of ram and 128 makes a

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:06,849
flash there's been improvement but

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,389
daggone it's just been incremental and

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:12,889
the user experience isn't that different

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,400
just now in the past year they've

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,669
started doing

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,030
some app type things and stuff like that

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:24,660
but to me that's just linear progression

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,930
it's not exponential now in the computer

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,590
side if you take a look at 2002 we had

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:34,789
some big clunky laptops we had desktops

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,719
here was kind of a typical configuration

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:44,400
2.66 gigahertz with a single core or the

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:47,730
128 megaman and a 30 gig hard drive well

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,209
today not only are the laptops liquor

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,120
and the desktops cooler and running

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:55,890
amazingly faster but we also have

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,080
computing technology in our pocket in a

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,560
smartphone we also have it on our

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,100
tablets you know the tablets today have

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,110
far more power than the routers run the

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:13,110
networks and something's backwards here

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:14,520
guys we're missing an opportunity so

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,890
I've already talked about some of these

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,279
but you can kind of get the idea you

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,190
know the NIP nips router specs they're

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,959
running and Linux is what we're running

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:30,330
on them it's your single core processor

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,029
it might have a USB port there's no

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,630
video out there may be a serial

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,250
interface get out your soldering iron

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,690
okay because if you want access to it

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,880
you don't have to pull the board and

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:46,650
start soldering on so that you can

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,900
connect to the serial interface here's

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:54,209
the you know here's the comparing

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:56,459
contrast when we started developing for

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:59,820
these and in one of the places where

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:03,450
there was a line need was VPN so we

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,440
started creating a very simplified VPN

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:11,670
loading system in gateway system but

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,709
what we found was we were heading past

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:18,480
the capability of the router the router

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:21,720
you know if you had a 50 meg connection

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,310
maybe we get 12 megs of throughput if

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,670
you had a lot of latency maybe we're

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,320
going to get 4 Meg's it through

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:31,900
put okay and I remember one time I'm

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,320
looking at our software I'm like ah you

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,150
know yeah I could be doing DLNA and I've

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,160
got a bunch of files at home I want to

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,200
share I've got like eighty thousand

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,910
songs on a hard drive and twenty

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,910
thousand photos and that kind of stuff

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,530
so i turned it away i hook up the hard

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:54,120
drive and my network goes get it wrong

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:59,190
and the network just grinds to a halt

00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:02,170
because i had just given that little cpu

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,700
far more that it could possibly handle

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:10,780
and what time it is it's kind of like

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:15,220
you have to drive a golf cart like

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,870
that's your ride and you may pimp that

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,080
right as much as you want there's still

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:23,680
a golf cart and if you want a head from

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,730
here to Atlanta it's going to be a rough

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:32,980
trip so take a long time and it's not

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:35,200
going to be a whole lot of fun now we've

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,560
got this myths platform we've got VPN

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,050
setup on its crank in a way it is at

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,570
ninety-eight ninety-nine percent it's

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:49,990
maxed out you take those same processes

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:52,330
put it on a farmer or robust version of

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:56,890
linux and now you're running at three

00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,630
percent four percent maybe if you're

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,430
cranking a bunch of data through the

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:05,920
tunnel you might get up to twenty

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:09,190
percent utilization to me you know what

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,290
if I've got that much runway I can do

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,570
some cool stuff with that much

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,850
capability that right now is just a

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,680
lying there

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:22,370
it's a little bit in terms of analogy

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,050
you know five years ago a lot of people

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,100
in this room probably had a clamshell

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,769
home and it had firmware on it just like

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,480
your router house today and you open up

00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:34,790
that phone and it had two applications

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,980
or maybe three applications and it had

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,540
phone and contacts and might have had

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,720
some primitive browser but you can just

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,639
dynamically in a fluid way add

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,220
applications and things like that that's

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:55,399
exactly the transformation we're looking

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:58,399
at doing in the router market so what

00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,269
we're recommending for a gyro router if

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,519
you're putting together a system at home

00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:07,100
and what we plan to be selling is it

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:11,810
your own router will have tonight's more

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:14,389
like this we want enough room to have

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,519
some capabilities and Debbie able to add

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,430
modules and that kind of stuff and we're

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:24,410
going with an SSD drive for gigs of RAM

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:27,889
USB 3 0 the next the Wonder units it's

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:32,810
in development right now has the USB 3

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:35,630
of processor speed dual core 1.8 Adam

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,759
but you could certainly build a machine

00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,839
with i7 if you wanted that to be at the

00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:45,290
core your network ubuntu server we're

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:49,279
using the long-term supported edition of

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:51,139
1204 and then they'll have a gyro layer

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,399
I'll get more into the layers in just a

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:58,550
minute the current unit has vga the one

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,519
next year will have hdmi and there's a

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:05,199
serial interface on the case so if

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,180
you're a developer if you're a hobbyist

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,130
you have access now through serial you

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,120
have access to the video and keyboard

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:21,350
you can you know you got full full

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:24,329
rights to this machine so one day we

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:29,129
plan on having one custom built for us

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:31,529
would love something like this but these

00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:37,769
would be four antennas you got your win

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:43,319
port HDMI dual USB and ideally we would

00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:46,549
have five six eight ports I want to have

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:49,199
more ports and we currently have because

00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:54,499
if you're anything like me four ports

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,499
goes away real quick around your network

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,689
so again this is going to reiterate and

00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:06,809
then the wireless card in here will be a

00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:08,850
wireless and eventually it can be AC but

00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:11,040
it needs to be a master mode or have the

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,769
capability of going you master mode so

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:20,339
that you can run an access point on this

00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:25,470
device now here's where it gets cool

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:28,739
though is that if that shirt if that

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,779
gyro router is only running at three

00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:33,749
percent five percent 10-person you've

00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:36,569
got all this extra capability what do

00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:39,119
you do with it well there's a lot of

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:41,189
projects that if you're like me you

00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:42,929
spend a week putting together a machine

00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:44,669
that's going to be your file server you

00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:47,339
spend a few days putting together a

00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:49,439
phone server at work or you spend a few

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,100
days what I only do really is

00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:54,809
standardized that process there's no

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,549
reason why do you need to spend a week

00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:58,049
figure in something out and I need to

00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:00,059
spend a week figuring something out and

00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:03,209
Sebastian needs to spend a week figuring

00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,509
something out it just seems like we

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:09,389
should be able to figure it out once

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:12,449
create a plug-in module and make that

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:16,759
module available for the community for

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:20,699
one click install so these are some of

00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,860
the modules that we're considering will

00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,379
become low-hanging fruit that just make

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,379
a lot of sense on the network

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:38,090
let me show you so here's kind of a

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,330
conceptual mock-up this is not a working

00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:47,000
this is just HTML files on my computer

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:50,600
here but you see that some of the

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,550
modules a lot and because just like your

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,900
smartphone when you get your smartphone

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,670
it comes with phone browser contact

00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,220
there's a couple of things if you've

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,240
ever tried to erase any of those it's

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,790
not going to let you because you're

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,860
going to break the device okay so

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:10,300
there's some base modules it just makes

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,459
sense they're going to be on the router

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,709
then you've got modules that can add on

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,709
and we use some kind of brand names like

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:24,500
XBMC or free knives or freepbx just so

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:28,069
you can't get the idea but when you

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,340
scroll over one it gives you a

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:35,150
description of that module what you're

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:38,300
going into in under networking you would

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:42,440
basically have every functionality that

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:48,020
your standard writer today has that

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,760
would be one of the modules but then if

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,910
you're into VPN you may have this VPN

00:17:49,760 --> 00:18:00,350
module unless you set up ppt pl20 PST

00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:02,900
sstp openvpn and bpn is a lot of what we

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,480
cut our teeth on so you can expect to

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,510
see a lot of VPN type capabilities built

00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,660
into this device probably out of the

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,300
gate because we also have a customer

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:19,760
base that wants faster and faster VPN

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:22,540
routers under the mod store we're

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,970
looking at doing something that

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,280
modules yet developed we're able to test

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,250
them in health make sure they meet the

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,500
standards and that kind of stuff we're

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,890
able to have users right now and you're

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:42,200
able to one click load a module under

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:45,050
this device so the idea is just like you

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,670
have a smart TV at home that may be

00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,290
running links in the background the

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,660
average user doesn't know that all they

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,690
know is they can add a functionality by

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:58,760
clicking a nap that's what we're go on

00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:00,560
bring to the router platform to meet pbx

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,040
is one of those things that should be a

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,870
core functionality one of the early

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,880
modules not that's going to be on

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,280
everyone but should be one of those

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,550
things that you can test the ability to

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,650
do file serving to do media streaming

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,780
the ability to stream to your TV through

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:23,120
the hdmi port on the back if you wanted

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:29,600
to or the ability to pull streaming IPTV

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:32,510
from the device IP cameras zone family

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,180
filters one of the things I'll mention a

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,730
little bit more about this is from a

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,460
philosophical standpoint and ethics

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,170
standpoint I'm of the general belief

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,410
that actually have control over what

00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:48,620
comes into my house I also believe that

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,440
you have to I should have control of who

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,350
knows personal things about me that I do

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,060
with in my house so one of the things

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,830
that we're going to be focusing on is

00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,830
that kind of security for this device

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,770
now I want you to notice up here this

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,290
about protected I'll talk about that in

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,790
just a minute when we get two modes but

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:18,790
it's a really important part of this

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,790
project

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,130
so I pop the nominee of these already

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,240
i'm not going to read the slide to you

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,760
but you get the idea and he was great i

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,590
was talking with so in the other day and

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,710
I was like what mod would you want to

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,940
see on your gyro then he said an email

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:43,010
server mean why would you why would you

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,930
mind email server on your on your home

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,210
network when there's any places that

00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,340
provide that service for free he's like

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,670
things I want control I don't want my

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,950
files and my email repository sitting

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:58,430
out there somewhere I want it in my

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:01,640
network in my home and I said you know

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,560
that makes total sense and what's great

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,270
as we get this out in the community

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,680
there's going to be people with all

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:11,450
sorts of great ideas I don't need to own

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,220
them home I don't need to be the one

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,130
coming up with all the ideas it's about

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,680
you guys coming up with the ideas

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:23,120
there's already you know a guy today was

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,980
like well does it run radius server like

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,980
why do you want this to ruin radius

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,250
server and he said because I have a

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,500
llama small businesses multiple synology

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,970
zand I want a radius server centralized

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:40,040
that them late create a margin so this

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,560
you know i'm going i expect we're going

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,370
to see lots of modules that we wouldn't

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,500
have even expected now i mentioned a

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,600
minute ago about that survived protected

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:55,700
mode that's the router when you get out

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,130
of the box if you buy one from us if

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,290
you're not installing one on your own

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,290
hardware if you're buying one from sabai

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,900
technology you turn on or if you've just

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:10,420
installed gyro on a device and you go

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:13,010
the web interface it's in protected mode

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,980
that's the mode that you see your Smart

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:18,050
TV in you're not seeing in the back end

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,020
stuff or anything you're just seeing a

00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,260
running

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,650
system in protected mode you have the

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,870
ability to reset and default the mods

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,540
that you would install have been vetted

00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,860
and Savannah technology has gone through

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,410
them and tends to make sure there's no

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,720
big conflicts with other software or

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,730
made sure that this conflicts were

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,270
resolved before they got out in the

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:46,070
store to one click install it's a one

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:49,770
click uninstall and it's supported by us

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:51,390
so if you're running your router and

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,120
you've installed them out and something

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:57,420
all sort of starts acting weird you've

00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:01,530
got a place to go no place a call where

00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:04,950
you actually talk to a person in the

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:09,510
mind control mode which you probably are

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:14,300
just call control mode that's like one

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:17,250
of you has has developed a module and

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,020
you email me and say hey I got it's

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:23,970
working it seems to work great with you

00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:26,790
would you try it out well if i go to

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,890
mind control mode I've accepted that I'm

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,730
no longer under the umbrella of support

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:34,620
for some biology but I can install

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,510
anyone elses it's kind of like on your

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,960
Android when you say yes I want to be

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:45,510
able to install applications other than

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,910
from the google play store and that's

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:53,220
supported by your friends the community

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:55,290
in developer mode you can hook up you

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,770
can hook up monitor and keyboard you can

00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,720
sue them and you can ssh you can get

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,090
right down to the core work command line

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,220
you can even though the router is

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,950
setting iptables you could go in and

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,170
plus I table past and put something else

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:16,140
in you can override anything's your

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:19,730
machine so basically the idea is is why

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:24,210
should you ask for mission to root it

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:29,200
it's your device and what we're building

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:33,549
into it as much as we possibly can

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,169
is the ability for you to say all right

00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:41,620
I think I screwed something up let me go

00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:46,750
back to protected mode it works to undo

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:49,450
what you've done or initiates a process

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,730
for you to reflash the drive but the

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,740
idea is is you should be able to play

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,909
and as much as possible we should make

00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:00,010
that sandbox a fun place to be

00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:02,980
worst-case scenario I can envision a

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:08,250
developer sending in the harddrive Len

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:12,850
is flashy adore us hooking them up to a

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:16,240
an image that they can just put in or

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:23,440
download a flash drive to reflash image

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:25,630
kind of stuff so here's conceptually the

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,559
service layers of your system layers and

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:32,500
this is what we're developing the whole

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:35,789
thing is built on as standard a platform

00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:39,039
we feel that we can put on it is

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:41,529
user-friendly a platform as we can do it

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:47,220
on and that's an ubuntu linux server

00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:50,590
running 64-bit with a lamp stack running

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,889
so that's what's at the core of this

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:56,220
machine it's not a micro linux with busy

00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:58,870
box or something that's a full-blown

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,590
ubuntu server that's very easy to get

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:05,169
apps for and that kind of stuff now on

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:09,659
top of that you've got the gyro package

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:14,320
which is basically handling translation

00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:17,260
between the GUI and the underlying o

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,210
house so it's passing back and forth

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,200
data it's making sure you're not about

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:26,200
to mess up your system things like that

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:30,850
then the user interface layer that's

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,860
what you're seeing and you're working

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:37,500
working on on the device and then you've

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,500
got the modules that lay on top of that

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:47,450
that's kind of the scheme of how it

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:50,149
works now in that first server layer

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,679
already meant to what it's got very

00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:54,440
standard we're playing to use some

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,289
long-term support show as a new

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,210
long-term support comes up we would

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:03,019
eventually migrated over to that and

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:08,059
then continue that very useful easy to

00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:12,220
work with lots of apps lots of

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:17,210
applications on the package layer is

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:20,869
built on limps leave sac in PHP some of

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:25,369
the stuff I'm not the developer I'm I'm

00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,889
the guy who conceptually like gets where

00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:29,809
we need to go and David who may be in

00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:33,080
here low layer who will be at the table

00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:37,070
when we're done it was actually helping

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:40,220
put this all in code on the service

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:42,499
configuration you have access to system

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,869
functions through the API and ensures

00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:47,179
with no conflicts with other configs and

00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:49,399
then you have configuration tracking so

00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:55,999
even on that device you're able to do

00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:59,929
roll backs and things like that on the

00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:01,970
GUI layer one of the things is when you

00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,980
mouse over something every object

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,740
basically will have real-time help

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:10,070
that's going with it what what is the

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,860
you know what is the gateway what does

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,899
that mean what would the typical thing

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,320
be why would you use the AC P versus

00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:23,360
static etc so real-time help that the

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,070
the user does remember I want I want

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,899
someone who doesn't even understand the

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,960
Linux is working on this to be able to

00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:34,100
run it if they want in fact I want that

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,659
to be the mass market for it validation

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,409
and they doing layer there's a

00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:44,899
validation that you're not putting in

00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:47,680
for the subnet mask 5966 for net you

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:51,000
know that kind of saw it validates

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,730
it validates the data you're putting in

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,830
very intuitive controls our tagline for

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,700
our company is technology for the people

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:03,990
and the idea is is it's great that you

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,890
and I can do these projects as we can

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,350
weaken things that we're putting

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,420
together but what I think's even greater

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,420
is when Grandma can have a file server

00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,520
sitting in her home and she died know

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,980
anything about that all she knows is

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,340
she's got all our photos in one place

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:24,910
and she can find them it's seamless it

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,220
makes sense now what you know is what

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,230
the database is behind that you know you

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,810
know all sorts of stuff the grandma is

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,190
never going to know about that but

00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:38,470
ideally you want to bring this to the

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:41,980
everyman door every woman modular ease

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,550
of use and in my control mode you can

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,510
literally load a file and install

00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,390
templating panels if you're developing

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,400
for this you don't have to recreate the

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,930
wheel every time if we've got the slider

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,640
bars figured out we've got the

00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:58,360
validation figured out all that kind of

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,210
stuff you can as you're developing tap

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,100
into those templates and then

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,220
everything's as open as we can possibly

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,770
make it I got to tell you when I started

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:13,120
this company I don't think I put this in

00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:15,220
the slides but I literally I was just

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,130
recovering from being entirely in for

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,470
four years I had been taking every extra

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,270
bit of money I had in paying off debt

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,300
and that kind of stuff and when I got

00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:30,220
laid off I started my company with 500

00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:32,560
bucks because that's what I had so when

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,950
I started when we started looking as we

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,680
went as we've grown we've grown

00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,900
organically we bootstrapped but one of

00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:45,130
the things I'm realizing is either i

00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:48,220
need a war chest to patent everything a

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,070
lot of people out and crazy security all

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,320
that kind of stuff where I need to go

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,270
exactly in the opposite spirit which is

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,279
the way I really prefer anyway I mean

00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:02,110
the open source community you know what

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,759
go for it we're going to put out there

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,809
we're going to develop it as a community

00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:10,840
let's see how fast linksys can move you

00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,730
know I think really that's the only way

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,159
for a small business to protect itself

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:23,759
is to be completely open and transparent

00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:26,379
in their development on that mod layer

00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:31,320
anything you do bunchy server can be set

00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:31,320
up to do you could create a mod for it

00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:37,779
it has built-in use of protection unless

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,869
you override it what you don't want is

00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:43,240
people brick in there bricking it but

00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:45,220
what you also want is as anyone here

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,669
ever brick something in DD wrt and you

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,950
weren't able to bring it back to life

00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:53,440
what you wanna say worst case scenario

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:56,619
you pop a new drive in there right or

00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,039
you wipe the drive and you put in it's

00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:02,289
no longer a static firmware a hard-coded

00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,730
firmware that's in there and boy if you

00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,529
screw it up how in the heck are you

00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,049
going to get it it's literally a hard

00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:12,009
drive you could root remove pop on

00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:15,480
another machine wipe it reflash it with

00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:15,480
the image you're good to go

00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:21,840
configuration insurance development

00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,840
community our marketplace

00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:33,120
Steve Jobs said this about innovation

00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,799
it's really funny with David right back

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:41,340
there in the light blue shirt I'll point

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:44,070
oh I have David isms that I record at

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,659
work and he said one of the things that

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,280
David said one of the first months we

00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:49,500
were arguing about whether we should go

00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,360
down the patent road and do something

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,059
close or whether we should go open and

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,659
he said you know in technology you make

00:32:54,059 --> 00:33:00,510
money by innovating by innovating faster

00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,159
than the other guy and you know that's

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,020
really what we're trying to do for yours

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,159
you know let's speed the course of

00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:09,710
development let's keep it open so it's

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,559
not really about the money it's about

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,559
the people how we're lad how we use it

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,419
so the potential market one of the

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,710
things that's really funny and

00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:32,640
interesting to me I love seeing kind of

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:34,500
global global I'd love to see how large

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,990
market is going to shift and what

00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:43,710
happened back in 2010 in January the

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:47,250
same month i started my company nexus

00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:49,140
one was launched he wouldn't remember

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:54,350
about how much that costs when it came

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:59,100
out it was around eight hundred dollars

00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:01,110
and when you look back today three years

00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,230
later the nexus one oh my goodness it

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,700
was they say i had more power than

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,730
should have bigger screen they should

00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,369
understand that but the initial market

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,950
for the nexus one for these android

00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,629
phones that was unlocked that you could

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:20,970
actually do development on was

00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:24,510
developers the initial market for this

00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:27,810
may not be mass market yet the initial

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,730
market maybe developers who want their

00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,730
hands on a great piece of writing

00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:36,350
equipment that they can actually mount

00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:40,310
by in a fluid fashion within the next

00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:42,619
route that comes in as the prosumer it's

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,320
a people to say you know why yeah I can

00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:47,179
spend $150 on our router that kind of

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,950
barely gets me by or i can spend any

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,889
hundred dollars on a router that kicks

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:56,060
ass and I'm proud to have in my in my

00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:59,330
house and that's the prosumers it's the

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,619
guys you don't mind spending twelve

00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,359
hundred fifteen hundred dollars for a

00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:07,880
laptop or more whereas I'm the value

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,840
clay guy I tend to go for the for the

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:15,170
lower in the equipment you've got small

00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,990
businesses in Soho how many small

00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:21,080
businesses would love to have a router

00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:23,480
that also did some server functions and

00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:27,680
did their phone server for a 20-person

00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,280
office very functional when you start

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,910
adding those pieces it's a lot more than

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,850
a thousand dollars and when you look at

00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,850
technically the support of that it's

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,770
it's a compelling value proposition for

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,600
small business but just like this the

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,220
smartphone remember when the smartphone

00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,340
came out and people are like why the

00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:57,950
heck would I want one I don't want to

00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,510
you know I thought that every May and a

00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,790
lot of people were still like well why

00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,640
would I want that but now everyone wants

00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,380
that we expect that same kind of

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:13,670
transition can happen in the router

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:17,540
market we have 10,000 routers around the

00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:19,359
world we're just a small company on Main

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,580
Street in simpsonville south carolina

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,710
but we've got 10,000 customized routers

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,600
worldwide that we've put out and we've

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,630
supported through the past three years

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:35,240
we've got experience in the router side

00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:38,180
we see where things are going we're

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,010
connecting with South Koreans who have

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,650
200 mm

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:44,140
gigabyte pipes we're connecting with

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,560
Singaporeans who have fiber optics into

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,360
their condos and we're connecting with

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,000
people in China who still can't get

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:57,130
facebook unless they use our router to

00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,070
bypass the Great Firewall so we see kind

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:04,870
of the needs and the hurts and all that

00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:08,350
as we look around the globe it is what

00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:11,830
we do and we love to do we're all about

00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:15,880
networking we're all about linux I will

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:17,410
tell you I had never run linux gotten

00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,000
down to the core of it until three years

00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:28,120
ago but my goodness what an amazing

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:30,520
powerful allows lives changed the first

00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:35,290
year sabbatical adji was in business and

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,780
we had created our first VPN router and

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:41,800
one of the customers have picked it out

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,050
Christmas morning in 2010 a walk down

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,790
seriously check my email as you kids

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:49,120
have finished open it in the presence

00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:52,680
and one of the u.s. ambassadors to

00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Russia run email and said you don't

00:37:52,680 --> 00:38:00,160
realize what a difference this product

00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,580
has made my life I've been able you know

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,740
he said before every few months I was

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,720
having to replace my debit cards and

00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:13,870
stuff because the numbers kept getting

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:17,680
pulled from the IP traffic you know my

00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:19,900
family couldn't securely email those

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,210
kinds of things we've got you know

00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,850
missionaries in China that use our VPN

00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,410
router it's really funny we get so

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:29,620
psyched about the technology but the

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:34,630
reality is it is about people and it's

00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:38,110
about enabling people to be free to live

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:39,820
their lives without obstruction that's

00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,450
what I think this is this is really

00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:45,580
about it's about community it's about a

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,730
group of people getting together into

00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,410
saying they want to change things and

00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,880
some of our best friends have been

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,430
customers who have bought our

00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,630
like so we've got to know over the years

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,890
and who every time we come out with

00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,329
something new they're in there and

00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,819
they're helping give a seat back and

00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:04,089
they're getting the betas and stuff like

00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:07,920
that something that kind of wanted to

00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:10,480
end with here is some of the potential

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,210
when you've got that much capability

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,069
that is untapped at the core of your

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:19,440
network where some of the cool things we

00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:23,470
could do with it one of them I love is

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,000
community filtering I believe that as I

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:28,650
mentioned before I should have a right

00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,720
to decide what comes into my house well

00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:33,730
my phone system at my house is a system

00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,250
called uma and some of you guys in this

00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,559
room may have a NUMA one of the things I

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,660
love about him is I can look back at

00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,839
past phone calls have come into my house

00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:46,779
and I could say oh that was someone

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,410
trying to sell a credit card that was

00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:54,819
and I can classify calls that were not

00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:57,970
friends and family that gets added to a

00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:01,150
community list when there's enough from

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:04,119
a certain phone number it goes on to a

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,039
community blacklist and I can choose on

00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,829
Umeh that I don't want to hear from

00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:12,009
credit card sales people that I don't

00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:13,750
want to hear from nonprofits trying to

00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,849
raise money I want to hear from these

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:19,150
kind of things what if you could do the

00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:22,089
same thing with your IP traffic you

00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,559
could take a look at the places you know

00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:25,440
have you ever taken a look at your logs

00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:28,480
and all the places you're getting

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,579
traffic from and so many of them weren't

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,299
ones that you actually went to their

00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:36,160
site you know how cool would be if you

00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,960
could classify those and we can create a

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,109
community black list if you got a

00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,849
million people all doing that now you

00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:44,470
got some serious power and you can opt

00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:48,089
in or you can opt out or you could

00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:48,089
choose what you want it blocked

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:59,009
automated VPN let's say you've got a

00:40:52,390 --> 00:41:02,019
gyro unit at home and you have you got a

00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:02,589
three-month job in raleigh north

00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:05,979
carolina

00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:10,150
and you get a temporary apartment you

00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:13,900
set up a second gyro and it says you've

00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:16,809
already got one of the setup would you

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:21,069
like to connect the networks and unify

00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:23,920
them as one network if you choose yes

00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:26,410
the routers can connect to survive

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,969
technology we can facilitate the

00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,950
handshakes and the passing of

00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:35,200
credentials etc and then back right out

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:37,119
and you have one network and all

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,729
everything you had at home is now right

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:45,160
with you and Robyn Starling web is what

00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:49,479
i'm calling this one is something David

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:53,049
and I were just kind of visioning the

00:41:49,479 --> 00:42:00,789
other day but I don't know if you've

00:41:53,049 --> 00:42:04,900
seen these before you ever seen birds

00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:10,259
doing this well how cool would it be at

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:14,319
the traffic that left your home could

00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:18,009
not be trackable as a single stream even

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:21,789
encrypted or not but could break out and

00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:23,529
bounced off other sub I routers where

00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:29,259
people had enabled that functionality

00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:32,979
and then swarm back when the information

00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:37,380
is coming back to you I don't know about

00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:41,309
you and I love this country more than

00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:45,069
more than anything but I tell you what

00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:47,920
there's some freedoms and some privacy

00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:52,210
issues going on today that are really

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:56,519
scary and you know I should have some

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:59,440
control over my life and over my home

00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:04,739
what comes in and what goes out and who

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,739
sees it I believe

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:15,630
if this sounds like something that you

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,170
you know what I like where this is going

00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:22,670
I want to be engaged I would ask and

00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:28,650
many of you have already done this but

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:32,760
Clinton QR code go to self doubts about

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:34,320
technology com and sign up there I'm not

00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,580
going to send you a bunch of sales stuff

00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,350
but am going to keep you informed about

00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,410
the project if you move forward as we

00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:45,260
have our verse first viable version of

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:47,910
the software that you can stall

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:54,620
development opportunities things like

00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:54,620
that or at the booth you can sign up and

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,160
what will be giving you access to is the

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,730
ability to get updates downloads alpha

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,610
beta etc oh let me tell you about alpha

00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:11,430
beta release conceptually what we're

00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:14,910
trying to do for you right now David's

00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:19,260
working very hard on the foundational

00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:22,550
structure okay on which this is being

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:29,850
developed and on which mods can be

00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:32,220
developed as we get that ray we're going

00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:34,410
to get to a point where your base

00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,970
functionality of a router all the

00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:41,340
networking port forwarding wireless that

00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:44,310
kind of stuff that's good and it's ready

00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:49,890
to go and it's in a module and we have a

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:51,750
working unit which we have a very basic

00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:55,890
functional unit right out there right

00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:58,440
now but once it's at the point where it

00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,600
would compare with at least with the

00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:06,930
mips unit that's what we're calling

00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:10,260
alpha that means you're you're running

00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:12,720
the car without all the sheet metal and

00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,860
without all the protections building

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,320
yeah and all that kind of stuff if

00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,510
you're interested in being on that

00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:22,070
Alpha Team we're interested in having

00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:24,260
you as part of it beta is you know why

00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:28,040
you're a power user you love being on

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,570
the cutting edge you love trying out the

00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,610
newest stuff before everyone else gets

00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,740
it and that kind of stuff beta means

00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,720
that there's going to already be some

00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:38,570
modules develop that you could install

00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,790
things like that module developments

00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,690
going on and then the third would be a

00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:50,660
full release third would be full release

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:52,970
I actually worked for Tony Robbins out

00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:56,060
in California for a year he was an

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,620
interesting guy very very smart one of

00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,600
the things he says is the quality of

00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,340
your life is in direct proportion to the

00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,180
amount of uncertainty you're willing to

00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:07,820
live with and that's one of the things

00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,550
about some by technology yes David you

00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:16,450
can ask any of the employees out there

00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:20,150
we've we are okay with pushing the edge

00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:22,100
we're okay with well there isn't a clear

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,310
market for this yet are you sure you

00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,380
want to do this I mean we're willing to

00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:30,550
go ahead because I believe strongly this

00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:35,230
is where routing is is going to go and

00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:38,980
we've been blessed with an amazing staff

00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:43,310
we're up to 10 folks now but they are

00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:49,180
dedicated smart and a coherent team and

00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:51,830
I'm just very honored to to lead them

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:54,440
and that's pretty much in a nutshell

00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:58,030
gyro and what I'd like to do is just

00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:01,270
open up the floor to questions ideas

00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:01,270
statements uh-huh

00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:17,040
can you repeat the home sorry yeah

00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:19,890
that's a great question so his question

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,450
was when you're talking about freepbx

00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,430
have you thought about actually having

00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:28,500
the physical phone lines and stuff on

00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:30,210
there no for now because partly that can

00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,880
be done with a TAS and things like that

00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:36,270
through the ethernet and what I want is

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,230
the what I want is the simplest and most

00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:41,880
powerful for the most people at the gate

00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:44,220
though I will say one of the things that

00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,349
we've considered is would it be great if

00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,839
we got to a volume of the hardware

00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:54,030
manufacturer where we could have a

00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:58,369
sliding port where you could plug in for

00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:04,920
example a cable modem with the cable

00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:08,970
hook or a fiber optic you know or some

00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:11,569
phone jacks or you know if really what's

00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:17,270
good what that's going to take a scale

00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:17,270
it's a great question yes

00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:38,660
yeah yeah that's great one of the things

00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:41,030
that we actually do want to do is I know

00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,550
there's been this huge move to know

00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,470
antennas or the antennas are actually

00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:47,870
built within the plastic of the device

00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:50,330
we do want to have the ability for

00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:55,220
people to use specialized antennas and

00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:59,930
stuff like that on it the answer to your

00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:01,790
question is really as sub I technology

00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,330
we're going to need to be focused on a

00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:09,260
core amount of equipment that we know

00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:12,410
will run with it but because it's on the

00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,940
bunch of server you absolutely and one

00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,330
of the things that you know particularly

00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:19,430
I know that you work with nonprofits up

00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,710
on that one of the things that we're

00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:24,710
dedicated to hear is you can develop you

00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:27,320
you can set up your own hardware and we

00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,930
can give you a list of known wireless

00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:33,560
cards and chipsets and that kind of stop

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:35,930
fit that our development has set it up

00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,390
but could you write a module installed

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:40,970
new drivers for a different card that

00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,160
would be a possibility and so it is

00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:45,550
possible also to create a module that

00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:49,850
you may just use privately or with a few

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:51,830
with one organization and you might not

00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,650
ever put up on the mod store because

00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:59,540
it's so unique in tweet for your

00:49:54,650 --> 00:50:02,690
situation that you may not ever make a

00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:09,490
mass-market thing that's a great

00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:09,490
question any other questions

00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,850
ok

00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:30,229
yeah David and David if you come up so

00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:32,890
you can use the mic and let me let you

00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:35,569
talk to the technical side of the house

00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:37,549
which is more wood well let me try

00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:40,640
without the microphone first because

00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:44,209
those they were forward yeah always

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,849
being recorded so anyways if any of you

00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:49,099
would like to answer questions without

00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:51,259
participating in group interrogation you

00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:53,150
can come by our table afterwards right

00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:55,789
over there on the corner anyways

00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,559
developing a mod all the mod is for the

00:50:55,789 --> 00:51:00,109
most part is really just a web app

00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:02,299
essentially it's a bunch of HTML CSS

00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:04,940
JavaScript and there's a server-side

00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:06,619
component currently all those are

00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,779
written in PHP but you can use any

00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:11,390
server side language you like that's

00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:13,099
essentially the long and short of it the

00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:16,910
limitations that we're putting on the

00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:18,979
mods there aren't any really apart from

00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,920
the fact that you basically have to have

00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:25,969
some kind of web UI in order it for it

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,829
to actually be a mod the other kind of

00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:29,329
half of that is we're looking at having

00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:32,239
a whole other class of them that are

00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:33,769
essentially sort of like virtual

00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,920
machines for those of you familiar with

00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:40,789
linux containers it's going to be say

00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:43,459
you want freepbx or FreeNAS it'll run in

00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:45,289
a linux container as a vm separate from

00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:48,259
the server separate from the rest of the

00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:50,749
machine that'll be a mod of a sort but

00:51:48,259 --> 00:51:53,479
it'll be you know a fairly hefty one

00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:55,759
compared to say a mom that tracks your

00:51:53,479 --> 00:52:01,729
stocks and sends you alerts about stocks

00:51:55,759 --> 00:52:03,680
or something like that so any sort of

00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:05,900
unclarity with that we actually have a

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,449
little paper that details all the design

00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,890
goals for the mods also the bulk of the

00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:12,440
code that we're putting into the front

00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:14,079
end for the UI is actually dedicated to

00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,549
making it easy for you to write out

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,289
essentially a template for what you want

00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:21,920
to control and how you want to represent

00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:22,740
it in the UI and then kind of the

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,650
toolkit take

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,840
care of drawing all the UI bits all the

00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,390
controls validating all the input and

00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,830
sending it back so developers don't have

00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,600
to bother with a whole lot of

00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:35,970
programming they don't have to write an

00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:41,280
entire essentially website in order

00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:42,840
right on so anyone's deal with I don't

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,760
say Drupal because I know the learning

00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,619
curve on Drupal is considered suicidal

00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,390
but if you've dealt with simple content

00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:49,770
management systems that's the kind of

00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:58,369
thing we're going for in terms of

00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:58,369
templating so what else mas questions

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:23,349
yes you would probably have to use some

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,329
kind of API for that because either it

00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:26,890
would have to already exist for instance

00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:28,900
I imagine asterisk has a number of

00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:30,489
things in it that I'm not even remotely

00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,890
aware of that do these kinds of things

00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:35,259
or you would have to kind of come up

00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:36,789
with an interface for it because you

00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:38,650
know I don't know how many of you are

00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:41,230
familiar with kind of the basic server

00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:43,539
client model with you know web stuff but

00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:45,309
you know what runs in the browser has to

00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:48,190
have some way of talking to what runs on

00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:51,069
the server as long as that's there you

00:53:48,190 --> 00:54:02,319
can do whatever you want with it so at

00:53:51,069 --> 00:54:03,309
least that's the idea probably Tim would

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,190
be a better person asked about that

00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:08,470
because he actually has been running

00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,450
proxmox which mostly uses virtualization

00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:12,670
so they're a little bit heavier than the

00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,589
Linux containers but they're the very

00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:17,650
close to it because of the way proxmox

00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:18,849
works he has a machine at home I think

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,670
he runs about eight or nine different

00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:25,059
machines on it concurrently and he has

00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:26,440
them running all the time I the closest

00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:29,559
thing I've gotten to this is I've kind

00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:32,170
of test it out how easy it is to install

00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:34,150
from an install CD in a linux container

00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,829
and I've only done one thing with it

00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:39,039
because I've been very busy with the UI

00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:42,730
so I haven't put a lot of time today yet

00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:45,220
I can tell you this the way that Linux

00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:47,230
containers work you know with normal vm

00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:49,660
typically you're running a kernel for

00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:52,150
every single machine on top of your

00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,769
carnal linux kernel enix containers work

00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,950
by sharing the kernel that you already

00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:59,380
have so there's a lot of overhead that

00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:02,799
you avoid that way and you pretty much

00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,390
only have the actual memory requirements

00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:09,150
and process requirements of the programs

00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:09,150
that are running in those containers so

00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:18,430
let me stand by David yeah I didn't

00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:21,510
realize you had a Michael and I thought

00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:25,630
you were just that loud I I do think the

00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:28,720
the bulk of the modules would be running

00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:30,760
on the the processes for those would be

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,730
running on the bunch of server yeah

00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:38,680
underlying layer it would be it would be

00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:41,590
a specialized program like freenas or

00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:44,200
something in bsd that you may want to

00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:46,720
run that would not be supported on the

00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,150
underlying ubuntu that you may want to

00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,160
do into virtualized instance yeah a good

00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:54,090
example I heard of earlier and this is

00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,980
one of the reasons behind this idea

00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:59,109
freepbx does not play well with other

00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,990
software on a server so if you want to

00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:03,790
run multiple say Apache servers with

00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,740
your freepbx install there's a lot of

00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:07,300
configuration that goes into that just

00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,790
to keep it from breaking other things

00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:13,780
and what we want to build into the gyro

00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:15,430
is if you turn something on if it's

00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,730
going to break something it tells you at

00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:20,320
least it doesn't just break it or at

00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:23,290
least you know what the requirements are

00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,090
before you turn it on the Linux

00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,070
containers allow us to kind of bypass

00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:30,089
the problem of trying to translate

00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:32,859
something like freepbx into a

00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:34,990
self-contained web app kind of thing we

00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:37,599
can just run it as a Linux container and

00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,430
let the freepbx people deal with you

00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,800
know their actual development we don't

00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:44,140
have to interfere with it or introduce a

00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,109
whole other branch or fork of it you

00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:53,400
know we get to essentially not metal in

00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:53,400
their world right that's great

00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,520
how do you mean I mean the the for

00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:11,470
instance the thing we have out there

00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:11,470
running now has an in card in it AC or

00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:23,750
I've not even heard of this honestly

00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:26,270
well hardware-wise the idea is pretty

00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,070
much we're trying to give you the

00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:30,980
ability to essentially put anything in

00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:33,860
it you would like as far as things you

00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,750
might buy individually also I would like

00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:38,180
to see us be able to offer a range of

00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:40,400
options for the hardware as far as

00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:43,640
individual pieces and modules that we

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,470
put into it but as far as just

00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,840
supporting it generally because we're

00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,850
building on Linux it's pretty much

00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,310
whatever is available as drivers

00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:54,380
currently which is a pretty broad range

00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:57,380
of things I know so I may sound rather

00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:59,180
vague saying that if it's supported in

00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,750
the network stack normally it'll be

00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:05,570
supported on our product oh well then

00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,330
there you go yeah so yeah because we're

00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:10,300
trying to muddy the waters as little as

00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:14,060
possible to keep everything familiar

00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,680
that's why a boon to server PHP you know

00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,960
the web app stuff these are all things

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,970
that everyone uses pretty much all the

00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,740
time every where the things are familiar

00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:24,830
with we're not introducing like our new

00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:27,170
special thing that you have to learn you

00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:28,700
know we're trying to keep it simple well

00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,740
my big believe I'm looking at things

00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:36,680
choose that there's a huge power in

00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:40,640
aggregation and to me and there's a huge

00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:43,310
lack of power in lack of aggregation so

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,230
if you have a router and you have an

00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:47,360
and you have a home automation system

00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,600
and you have a server for your IP

00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,970
cameras and you have there's some real

00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,190
challenges there but if you can unify a

00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:58,040
big part of this is being able to

00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:00,620
aggregate services in the same way again

00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,570
like your smartphone aggregates a lot of

00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:07,190
different functionality and one little

00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:10,760
handheld device or tricorder as some

00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:14,660
people in trying that's right any other

00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,490
questions for the group if not I want to

00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:19,160
thank you guys so much and we'll be here

00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:20,750
afterwards and also over it over at the

00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:33,710
table but I thank you guys so much for

00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:35,810
your time your customers rely on your

00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:38,210
website or application if it's slower

00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:41,120
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,980
and costs you money keeping your

00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,480
business critical systems humming along

00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:48,790
requires insight into what they're doing

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,740
your system metrics tells stories

00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,750
stories that can reveal performance

00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,090
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,650
other problems but how do you keep an

00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,290
eye on all of your systems performance

00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:02,350
metrics in real-time and record this

00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:04,090
data for later analysis enter longview

01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:06,100
the new way to see what's really going

01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:08,260
on under the hood the long view

01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,330
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,790
of all your systems providing you with a

01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:16,150
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:18,730
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,500
load and network usage click a specific

01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:22,900
system to access its individual

01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:25,410
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,820
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:29,470
comprehensive network data including

01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,810
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:33,370
available on the network tab and disk

01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:35,290
rights and free space on the disk

01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:38,110
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:40,660
displays usage statistics for individual

01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:42,820
processes the system info tab shows

01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:45,070
listening services active connections

01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,200
and available updates adding long view

01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:48,910
to a system is easy just click the

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,040
button copy the one line installation

01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:53,500
command then run the command on your

01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,180
linux system to complete the process the

01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,370
agent will begin collecting data and

01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,230
sending it to longview then the graph

01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:01,780
start rolling

01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,150
used longview to gain visibility into

01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:07,450
your servers so when your website or app

01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:09,310
heats up it stays up most enterprises

01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:11,380
today realize that usernames and

01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:13,180
passwords alone aren't enough to keep

01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,609
their networks saved from unauthorized

01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:17,050
intrusions that's like two factor

01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:19,420
authentication has gotten so popular

01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:21,460
lately that adds that extra layer of

01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:24,340
protection enterprise networks need to

01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,810
stay safe but what you may not know is

01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,150
that some two-factor authentication

01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:30,340
solutions they're better than others

01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:33,609
like two-factor strong authentication

01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:35,650
with wicked wicked goes beyond other

01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:38,260
authentication systems by being less

01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:41,050
expensive easier to implement and easier

01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:42,730
to use giving software-based token

01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:45,580
clients built to run on all major

01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:48,180
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,530
Android these tokens utilize a

01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,960
public/private key combination that's

01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:54,880
generated on device so there aren't any

01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,400
shared secrets flying around for

01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,250
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,109
special handling instead all keys are

01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,570
kept secure and private between the

01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:06,760
requesting token and your server which

01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:08,400
you control in house making it the most

01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,050
secure way possible to perform

01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,900
authentication encryption and with an

01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:16,660
extensive flexible API that support for

01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,609
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

these are these you know these

01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:45,089
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,430
discovered and then fixed is that really

01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:50,339

health I'll stack the most exciting

01:04:31,289 --> 01:04:39,269
event in recent memory for me was our

01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:41,849
first developer boot camp and our call

01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:45,449
gave people a gave me two weeks notice

01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:50,880
to come attend I was expecting 25 or 30

01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:53,400
people so we ended up with 87 people and

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,769
had to go get more chairs in the room

01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,489
twice everything within cloud computing

01:04:55,769 --> 01:05:02,219
is commodity and is open source and so I

01:04:59,489 --> 01:05:03,989
don't think that you will you'll see

01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:06,630
anywhere where open sources not

01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:09,539
pervasive in cloud computing and so i

01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:11,400
think it's i think it's an assumption i

01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,660
think when you talk about cloud

01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:16,009
computing you're really talking about

01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,009
open source cloud computing

01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:22,120
CloudStack is a robust solution for

01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:24,520
large deployments you have dozens of

01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:28,420
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:31,090
each data centers these hardware is

01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:34,570
going to fail and cloudstack is designed

01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:37,270
to handle number one that mass scale

01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:40,450
number two it's designed to handle the

01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:43,000
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:46,540
deployments started working on college

01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,870
attack over four years ago and it was

01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:52,570
the original set of people working on it

01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:56,680
had a background of delivering software

01:05:52,570 --> 01:06:00,910
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:04,510
lots of users actually using it high

01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:07,600
availability is a key feature multiple

01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:09,610
hypervisors support different network

01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,310
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:14,560
you better while step management server

01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:18,250
can be deployed in different physical

01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:19,900
machines it definitely has a huge

01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:24,880
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:27,490
there's a major movie studio that they

01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,760
were using CloudStack they were using it

01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:32,740
to transcode video and i thought that

01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,390
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:37,660
more fascinating is what they did during

01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:40,450
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,830
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,750
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:47,890
the instances and go back to doing real

01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:49,210
work CloudStack is vast it touches so

01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:51,280
many different aspects and there's no

01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,680
one person that's kind of like a master

01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:57,790
of all those realms I think cloudstack

01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:00,010
as a project is going to be one of the

01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:01,880
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:09,140
most feature poland

01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:12,400
and and robust platforms out favor Adam

01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,400
senior living through the clouds tag

01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,260
you

01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:35,660
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,610
ago we could not have imagined that

01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,830
asterisk would not only become the most

01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,960
widely adopted open source communication

01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:44,000
software on the planet but that it would

01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:46,520
impact the entire industry in the way

01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,500
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:51,140
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:53,090
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:55,190
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,570
transition of power from the hands of

01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:58,850
the traditional proprietary phone

01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:01,250
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:03,200
administrators of phone systems using

01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,430
this power our customers have created

01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,350
all sorts of business changing

01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:08,210
applications from small office phone

01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:10,730
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,320
the international carrier networks in

01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:14,120
fact there's even an entire country

01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,520
those communications infrastructure runs

01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,650
on esters the gym has always been about

01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,359
creating technology that expands

01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:22,520
communications capabilities in ways that

01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:23,720
we could never have imagined and that's

01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,480
part of what's game-changing about

01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,819
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,890
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:33,020
IP phones that extends control of the

01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,759
user all the way to the desktop the

01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,500
launch of these new products represents

01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:38,569
the next phase indigenous history of

01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:41,000
innovation these are the first and only

01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:42,680
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,240
power of esters when we first discussed

01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,279
our expectations for building a family

01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,440
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,180
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,799
the team to build the phones such that

01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:54,020
they were easy to install integrate

01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:55,850
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:58,430
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:08:55,850 --> 01:09:00,049
that goal user feedback is validating

01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:02,150
that when it comes to operation with

01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:04,580
astro space systems including our own

01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:07,160
Switchvox based product these are the

01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:08,480
easiest to use best integrated most

01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,060
interoperable products on the market

01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,029
today the digitally phones will

01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,140
initially include three IP des hommes

01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:17,029
uniquely designed to complement any

01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,920
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:21,589
these phones are different for a number

01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:24,230
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:25,670
designed for use with esters secondly

01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,109
we've made it really easy to

01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,660
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:31,759
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,210
to access information inside of asterisk

01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,299
allowing tight couple

01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:37,290
between an application and the phone

01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:39,450
additionally we've created an

01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:41,549
applications engineer that allows users

01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:44,790
and developers to create and run their

01:09:41,549 --> 01:09:46,560
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:48,509
done all of this at a very compelling

01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,190
price point at digium we're always

01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:52,290
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:54,870
the best value in business phone systems

01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:56,430
and also give them the power to create

01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:58,560
their own solutions or any

01:09:56,430 --> 01:10:00,300
communications challenge well continue

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,739
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,750
astros cooler bastard more

01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:05,400
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:07,860
asterisk and what communications even

01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:11,000
easier and together we'll change the way

01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:11,000
