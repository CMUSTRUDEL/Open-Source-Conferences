the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,619
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,830
linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,600
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,150
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,289
possible as it clearly says we're going

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,720
to be discussing open-source

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,940
virtualization specifically we're going

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,239
to be discussing proxmox has anybody

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,350
here familiar with proxmox at all one

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,480
two and a half also okay how many people

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,700
here with a familiar with VMware Zen

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,149
hyper-v all right this is the

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,370
open-source counterpart to that and so

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,930
it's going to be really it's really

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,629
really cool we'll go through some of the

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,239
basics of virtualization I mean for

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,989
those of you that don't know

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,579
virtualization is the creation of a

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:11,320
virtual rather than a physical version

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:23,350
of something offered for rating we good

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:26,710
a little higher is that any better all

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,390
right cool creating a virtual instant

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,420
operating system server storage device

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,060
network card whatever you know you even

00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,960
pretty much virtualize anything in a

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,570
computer we've got several types of hard

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,979
virtualization we're specifically going

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,660
to be discussing hardware virtualization

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,729
and a little bit of software today but

00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,030
it will go through all of hardware

00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:52,360
virtualization allows one server to run

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,890
multiple operations operating systems at

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,740
the same time decreasing the number of

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,110
servers that are required to run the

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,759
same workforce software virtualization

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,440
if you ever booted Mac in the windows

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,990
boot camp stuff like that it's actually

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,670
a software virtualization this typically

00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,239
happens on individual computers rather

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,000
than entire networks and desktop

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,160
virtualization VMware calls it VD is

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,840
kind of their proprietary system it's

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,480
it's a concept of virtualization that's

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,130
not limited to a single company though

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,470
scenario each computers preferences

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,940
operating system applications files are

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,230
hosted somewhere on the local machine

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,049
this has a number of benefits and

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,239
end-users for IT departments a previous

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:40,209
company that had we were using quite

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,709
terminal services and thin clients with

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,150
using running virtual machines and this

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,920
is really what the desktop

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,420
virtualization is talking about in

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,860
hardware virtualization there's three

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,230
primary types of hardware virtualization

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,000
you have full virtualization which is

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,540
just as it implies it's everything's

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,220
virtualize from you've got partial

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,690
virtualization where some of the

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,420
environment is virtualized but not in

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,579
its entirety and then you've got para

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,170
virtualized which is a hardware

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:10,269
environment that is not simulated

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,120
however guest programs are executed in

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,739
their own isolated

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,150
remains the key with pair of

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,590
virtualization is typically you have to

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,069
run some kind of modification on the

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,519
operating system to get it to run vmware

00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:26,150
tools anybody familiar with that that is

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,860
actually the this vmware is using pair

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,599
of virtualization and it's using the

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,190
vmware tools to allow you to use the

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,530
networking and all that good stuff so

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,150
that's where pair of virtualization is

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:40,879
coming in virtualization run requires a

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,319
hypervisor in order to run hypervisors a

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,690
piece of computer software firmware

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,700
hardware that creates in run virtual

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,319
machines and there's two types of

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,420
hypervisors that we traditionally see

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,030
first one is the type 1 it's where you

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,620
have your bare metal then you have your

00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:00,620
hypervisor followed by your guest

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:02,599
operating systems type 2 is you have

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,420
your hardware you have your operating

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,950
system then you have a hypervisor fought

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,290
by your guests and this is where we

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,720
typically see virtual box and vm you

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,659
install it inside of linux or windows or

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,820
mac or whatever and so you have a your

00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:20,680
hypervisors one level up we're mostly

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,680
going to be dealing with type one today

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:29,139
and the example that would be like

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:31,430
virtual box or vm workstation player

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,590
there are several virtualization

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,349
technologies that are going to that are

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,580
in use one of them is kvm and one of

00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:40,250
these gentlemen's actually ask me about

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,610
that it's kernel-based virtual machines

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,780
this is what most of us are probably

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,970
familiar with this way if you're using

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:53,800
Zen hyper hyper V stuff like that it's a

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:57,260
it's a full colonel virtual machine and

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,330
it's an open-source hypervisor kvm is a

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,610
full virtualization solution for linux

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,039
on x86 hardware containing

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:10,370
virtualization extensions for intel VT

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:12,229
and AMD v chipsets it's also a kernel

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,660
module that's been added to the mainland

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,910
Linux with kvm you can run multiple

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,219
virtual machines by running unmodified

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,610
Linux or Windows images it enables the

00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,430
user I Joe to be agile by providing

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,710
robust flex

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,810
and scalability to fit their specific

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,460
needs a little bit with this I came out

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,320
of an environment in my previous job

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,210
where we were a Microsoft shop we just

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,500
we went from physical servers over to

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,540
virtual servers and and and this is

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,050
where I really got into into the kvm

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,410
stuff was being able to run a mixed

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,750
operate a mixed of machines in the same

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,450
environment I had we had red hat servers

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,790
running right next to server 2012 and

00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,450
kvm is what allows us what allowed us to

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:05,190
do this openvz is anybody familiar with

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:07,260
openvz anybody familiar with lxc alright

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,850
cool we're all in the same that same

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,280
ballpark if you know anything about

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:15,390
those Oh PVC is a container based

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,980
virtualization for linux openvz creates

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,620
multiple secure isolated Linux

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:24,930
containers all the way otherwise known

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,940
as a ve de esas or VPS is if you are

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,790
online and go to all these hosting sites

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,710
and they're like by one of our VPS is

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,220
most likely what you're actually buying

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,170
is one of these one of these open visas

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,810
or inhale XE container style

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:45,480
virtualization it's on a single physical

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,800
server enabling better utilization and

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,360
ensuring the applications do not

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,510
conflict by separating the drawback to

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,790
openvz is it's only for linux-based

00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:00,600
operating systems you can't run windows

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:03,030
in openvz but the advantage is openvz is

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,650
it is extremely lightweight and what

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,650
we'll see that here in just a little bit

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,870
and specifically now we're going to get

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:14,580
into proxmox ve or virtual environments

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,830
and open source software optimized for

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,730
the performance and usability for

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,360
maximum flexibility we've implemented to

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,550
virtualization technologies both kvm and

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,430
openvz this is one area where proxmox

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,410
does stand out is that it offers two

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,380
types of virtualization technology where

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,590
most other solutions offer just one or

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:41,660
the other or something different

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,820
together proxmox is a complete

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,710
virtualization management solution for

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,870
servers it can virtualize even the most

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:54,260
demanding applications workloads running

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:56,810
on Linux or Windows servers it is it is

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,610
based on the leading keita kernel-based

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,160
virtual machine hypervisor as well as

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:07,210
openvz and it is the number one solution

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:09,830
for container based virtualization it is

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,120
completely open source and that's that

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,320
was a huge thing for me when I

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:19,970
discovered proxmox some three years ago

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,220
and is released on n a GPL version 3

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,990
license so you're free to do whatever

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:30,020
you want to with it you can have fun

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:32,510
with it proxmox is it's extremely robust

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,510
but also the community is very strong

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,730
and you can I actually purchase a

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,640
Support Package through proxmox but I'm

00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:43,340
that's really for a different day but

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,550
they do offer some support packages got

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,550
a question

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,080
yeah yeah

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:09,370
um it's available through proxmox

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:10,720
through their website Oh yet not sure on

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,249
that part I haven't I haven't dealt with

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,589
the source code of this actual platform

00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:17,050
before I've just everything I've done

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,610
was just straight off the ISO so that's

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,269
not something actually I'm not a hundred

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,160
percent sure on that it always gets

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,639
complex when you start dealing with

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,709
licensing use it open source software

00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,509
guarantees full access to all its

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,720
functionalities as well as high security

00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:37,199
and reality or yep look really able get

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,339
that word out today reliability

00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,279
everybody is encouraged to contribute

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,730
the proxmox community right now is about

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:48,519
200,000 strong and it's growing every

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,379
day and every problem that I've ever run

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,930
into with proxmox I've been able to

00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:55,749
answer directly off the forums within

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,439
just one or two searches so the

00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:03,790
community is really really awesome it is

00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:08,259
based on kvm hypervisor and openvz as

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:11,529
we've already said there's been some big

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:14,939
milestones for proxmox first release

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:19,769
April fifteenth 2008 with proxmox ve

00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:21,970
version 0.9 I mean they later

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,860
implemented the GUI from aging and

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,509
containers and 16 different languages

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:32,350
which was very nice April 2012 yeah was

00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:34,480
two point oh it does have a restful Web

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,629
API for any of you guys that are

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,819
interested in that high availability

00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:44,050
this is something that came around I

00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:45,670
believe in 1.7 and it's a huge feature

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,360
and we'll talk about that in just a

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,720
little bit in 2013 over 40,000 host and

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,250
more than 140 countries this is a little

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,420
bit misleading because that's 40,000

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,240
hosts that are registered with the

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,420
support system through proxmox so

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,309
there's considerably more of those out

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,310
there they just don't actually know

00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,500
about them because they don't

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:11,060
any I'm actively there's about 20,000

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,040
forum members right now and the cool

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,470
thing is proximate to the III point 0

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
was just released two weeks ago it's

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,890
added some really nice features that

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,860
proximus was lacking the biggest one

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:26,870
being the ability to clone VMs that

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,279
hasn't been there previously and so

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,850
that's one of the biggest upgrades that

00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,660
they've added in just the last two weeks

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:37,880
we're going to talk about system

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:40,640
requirements proxmox is built off of

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,600
Debian so pretty much anything that will

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,150
run debian 64-bit you can run proxmox on

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,820
the record the recommendations Elise are

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:55,760
dual quad-core socket server 64-bit

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,390
obviously it has to support the Intel VT

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,100
in the AMD v which is the virtualization

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:04,490
elements to the chipsets basically

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:08,420
everything circa 2008-2009 home pretty

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,400
much does support these these protocols

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,440
with the exception of your really low

00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,500
processors like some of your opinions

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,350
and and and things like that at least

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,820
eight gigs of RAM is good but if you're

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,520
like me the more the merrier you know

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,640
it's put 60 496 128 whatever you can

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,870
throw into it hardware RAID with

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,190
batteries you know hardware protection

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,950
the fastest hard drives you can get it's

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,990
obviously at least two gigabit nics and

00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,370
fencing hardware which is only necessary

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,370
if you're running high availability

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:52,040
fencing is a only thing the easiest way

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:54,620
to screen I'm not I'm not well over a

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,250
hundred sent well versed in fencing it's

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,500
it's a in order to run high availability

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,050
you have to have a centralized network

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,580
storage location that everything can

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,320
communicate you also have to have a

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,750
centralized controller and that's

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,370
classified as in for proximities that

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,070
the fencing environment it's actually

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,180
what's controlling the high availability

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,059
and we'll get into that a little bit i

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,339
don't use

00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,049
availability because I don't have a need

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,769
for it i'm not running a data center i'm

00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:26,489
running a network testing lab out of the

00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:28,499
closet of my spare bedroom so so some of

00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:30,839
some of the features that proxmox have I

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:35,849
can't I just don't have a reason to

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:38,189
utilize them and I as we progress I

00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:44,689
really really want to but it all comes

00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:44,689
down that just a time yes if you knew

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:36,149
we'll go through the minimum spec

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,709
requirements and this is is interesting

00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:40,320
because this is I actually use these own

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:43,260
a daily basis a lot of times obviously

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,910
64-bit processor 1 gig of ram hard drive

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,540
and a nick you can pretty much put it on

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,980
anything and in fact I've got a proxy

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,870
box installation running on this dual

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,959
core atom processor with two gigs of ram

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:59,640
and we will show that here in just a

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,950
little bit all right um the the

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,390
installation process for proxmox is

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,600
ridiculously simple you can go to

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,130
proxmox com download the ISO I'm

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,750
actually getting ready to install it and

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,209
it's going to be a little ironic because

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,260
I've been installed in virtualbox so

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,750
that you can actually see the

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,459
installation process I hope you'll see

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,790
the irony in that of using a

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:23,490
virtualization environment but that's

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:27,209
what we're going to do so I've already

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:36,810
got the ISO downloaded and we'll just

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:42,709
select Debian just give it decent amount

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,709
of RAM defaults will work for this

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,390
it's going to take about probably about

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,300
six minutes to go through the whole

00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,640
process running through VirtualBox

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,230
installing it on a physical machine mine

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,270
started on one of these devices in about

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,700
four and a half minutes so it's a very

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:30,800
fast process it's very easy it's like 10

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:35,600
clicks and a couple of bits of

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,340
information and you're done so while

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,800
this is voting give you a little bit of

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,550
back story about how how i came across

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:48,070
proxmox and what I use it for personally

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:51,950
about four years ago I got into network

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:54,590
testing and penetration testing and I

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:58,970
was living at home with my parents at

00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:02,560
the time and my mom didn't like the idea

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:06,949
of me having 30-something computers I

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:12,310
don't understand why something about

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:12,310
power consumption he / killed ridiculous

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,689
and right here what I'm doing just

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:23,930
setting up the hostname giving it the IP

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:25,670
address that i wanted to have and go

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,400
through and start the installation so

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:32,630
that's you give it your password you set

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,960
your location your toms own you're a IP

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,970
address your hostname and that's it and

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,440
it's going to run we'll take it just a

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:44,180
couple of minutes to actually go through

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,700
the install process but so I was wanting

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,310
to do network to testing but I had a

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,410
laptop and I had a desktop and I was it

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,840
and I had a stack of hard drives idea

00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,280
hard drives and I would keep installing

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,350
things on these different hard drives

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,090
and plugging and unplugging and all of a

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,350
sudden I need a windows machine I'd jump

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,630
over there I needed a linux machine I

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,130
keep switching out to run all these

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:08,350
different tests and stuff and so is a

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:11,270
very inefficient system and I didn't and

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,070
like virtualbox will or vm work wasn't a

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,720
good solution either because i didn't

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,680
have enough hardware to actually support

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,070
what I want me to

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,310
it was running so slow having multiple

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,480
VMs running that it just kind of

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:30,800
defeated the purpose of what I was

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:34,850
trying to do so in 2011 is when I

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:41,570
stumbled across proxmox and getting a

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:44,420
little feedback and so I downloaded it

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,580
and loaded it up on a machine and I

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,920
absolutely instantly fell in love with

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,860
it because it met every requirement that

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,580
I had because the setup that I have at

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,960
home I have a pretty robust server with

00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,820
it so it's got its own it's sitting

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,180
behind its own router and so from there

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,950
I can take my laptop with a boot into to

00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,280
back track or kali linux or something

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,030
like that i can have on a typical day

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,430
i'll have for XP pro boxes running a

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,580
couple of boone two boxes to windows

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:20,180
seven boxes a server 2003 and a server

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:23,210
2008 i'll run it from one box so i have

00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,070
I now have my own little play network

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,800
that I can do anything and everything

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,190
that I want to and not disturb anybody

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,410
else not I'm not having to worry about

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,960
mething somebody else's network or it

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,190
really anything and the other problem is

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,650
that I just didn't have access to

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,300
equipment you know it's it would up

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,640
until last couple years I'd never got to

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,920
touch a windows server or are there

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,190
things like that so it was the the fact

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,440
that I didn't have the resources to do

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,080
what I was actually trying to do proxmox

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,130
eliminated about ninety-five percent of

00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,840
those issues for me so i started out i

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:05,630
installed started on a core two duo box

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,850
with like six gigs of ram in that box is

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:11,990
still running proxmox today two years

00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,820
later and and I it just it opened up a

00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,410
whole world of opportunities and also

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,010
through this i was able to learn more

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,900
about networking because it does have

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,300
you have two choices when you create

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,400
your containers or vm you can actually

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,759
use an internal net or you can actually

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,219
bridge it to you to your

00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,779
local network and typically what I do is

00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:32,549
not bridgit to my local network because

00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,739
it's sitting behind a router that I can

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,329
connect to wirelessly so I can simulate

00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:40,739
a lot of network attacks over wireless

00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:43,229
because that's typically where my bread

00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:48,749
and butter Liza's fun stuff with

00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:58,259
wireless alright so it is installations

00:20:48,749 --> 00:21:00,440
done didn't take too long and tell it to

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,440
boot

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:23,029
sat in the ssh key and all that stuff so

00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:24,279
that you can ssh into the box also the

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,419
one thing that's really nice about

00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,179
proxmox is anything you can do in the

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:32,330
GUI it's just as easy to do to do in the

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,649
command line I'm just now actually

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,629
getting into the co-learning the

00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:37,609
capabilities of the command line because

00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:39,830
the GUI just works so well for me right

00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:41,450
out of the gate that you just guy just

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,730
kind of stuck with it but it's nice

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:51,980
knowing that I have the options to to

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:53,210
jump back and forth question that's

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,009
something we're gonna we're going to

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,649
talk about hearing just in just a moment

00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:59,629
once we as you can see the box is up and

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:06,190
running now and so what we'll do is I'll

00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:06,190
switch over to 2015

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,900
dude

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,929
and of course it's not willing to work

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,929
today

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,360
not a problem

00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:03,650
it helps if you're on the right wireless

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:06,240
network so how you guys doing all right

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,980
this this here is actually the proxmox

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,020
interface that's running off of this box

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,040
right here this one I've already

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,680
installed previously when you when you

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,620
log in it's our go to the interface

00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,120
you're greeted with the login page

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,210
proxmox supports multiple forms of

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,040
identification you've got the linux pam

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,540
authentification you can use radius it

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,360
has it's built a built-in

00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,210
authentification server ldap active

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,530
directory so pretty much any form of

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,290
authentication you're using in an

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:45,030
interval enterprise environment proxmox

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:49,440
supports out of the gate alright so

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:54,690
we're now in the GUI here and it's let

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:57,390
me open up the the list and and this is

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,210
this is this is where I spend most of my

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:02,190
time as far as with proxmox as you can

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,830
see over in the left hand column under

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,930
where it says self you've got 100 101

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,810
these are actually two VMs that are

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:11,490
already established in this system and

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,490
if you notice there's two different

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:17,340
icons one is this little triangle thing

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:23,430
and the others actually a monitor ones

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:25,320
kvm ones openvz and and and so it allows

00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,460
you to differentiate there we're going

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,020
to go through the interface just a

00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,670
little bit to show and I'm actually

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,780
going to get on my knee to do this which

00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,780
is going to make for horrible video

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:41,910
first going to start with storage

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:44,310
currently the 64 gig SSD in here proxmox

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,620
by default takes half the drive and

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,220
reserves it for your virtual machines so

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,680
currently have like 30 to about 32 gigs

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:56,430
available on a fresh install on this so

00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,000
if your install doing local storage for

00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:04,010
your VMs you you understand proxmox

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,180
supports multiple for

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,310
of storage you can you can just do a

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,290
directory you can actually mount an lvm

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,140
group and NF share which is what I do at

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,960
home I've got a nice that's run it's

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,080
actually running all my VMS and I scuzzy

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,550
and things like that so you can it's

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,250
your not just tied to the local storage

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:28,390
you obviously can mount act additional

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:32,930
drives and array so that you can have a

00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,850
ridiculous amount of disk storage but

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:37,490
currently on this instant installation I

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,930
am running everything local that so on

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,100
the local law how you'll have backups

00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,690
your images your ISO is your containers

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,310
your clones everything else is going to

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:50,510
be here but you can actually designate

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:52,280
if you have multiple storage it would

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,260
set up in this you can actually say your

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,390
clones go here your backups go to this

00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:07,850
device so you can actually segment where

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:10,940
everything's going alright so here's the

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:14,990
self node which is this here do a

00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:17,420
summary you'll see that it's a two dual

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,690
core atom processors 1.8 giga hertz with

00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,880
two gigs of ram not a lot not a lot of

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,850
hardware but it actually works pretty

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:32,480
well and running especially the linux

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:33,740
containers so what everybody is going to

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,650
want to do is the first thing they're

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,790
going to do is actually create something

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,490
so i'll be here in the top right hand

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,100
you have two options you can create a vm

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,260
or you can create a container and this

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,380
is where the you first start the to

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,020
decide what i'm going to do obviously

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,750
i'm not going to install windows and a

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,610
cake and a vm i mean sorry in a

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,310
container because it doesn't support

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,950
that most the time i'm going to install

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,420
linux in a container because it's a lot

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,310
lighter weight a lot more efficient

00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,890
proxmox includes what they could they're

00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:13,760
little they call it a download center i

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,160
guess and it allows you and hopefully

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,490
it'll pull this up because I'm

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,140
not this machine's not yes it will these

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:24,550
are all the prism I familiar with

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,320
turnkey Linux ok turnkey linux they're

00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:30,670
based out of Israel they're basically

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,380
making pre-made packages for different

00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,890
functions different things like that and

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:39,430
they're using openvz two containers to

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:43,090
actually patches package them and so

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:46,510
proxmox work with them and you can see

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,340
this entire list of just lots and lots

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:53,320
of things has anybody ever installed see

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:55,270
knows ok it's not too difficult but it's

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,790
not that fun either to actually install

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:05,160
it correctly I can actually just come up

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:05,160
here to the top and see if it'll let me

00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,550
well if it would give me the box

00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,850
wonderful

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,980
all right let's talk let's pick a

00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,910
different one says I can't get it

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,470
anybody here dude joomla nobody okay i

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,540
start i started as a web developer in

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,780
joomla so Jim ones were where it's that

00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,790
for me although i don't like 2.5 and

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,930
it's not going to actually resolve right

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,950
now we're just going to fail when i try

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,480
to download because i'm not connected

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,090
internet but i can actually go and

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,800
download all these containers that they

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,690
have pre-made so i don't have to worry

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,560
about creating them they have like

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:58,540
ubuntu 12.04 debian like four six five

00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,520
six and seven centos fedora they've got

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,590
all these pre-made containers so you can

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,230
just once you get proxmox installed it's

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,210
literally you just start downloading and

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:10,990
creating containers i've already

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,190
downloaded an abuti 12.4 so i'm going to

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,400
actually show you the process of

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,310
creating a new ubuntu container so i'm

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:22,000
going to go to create container and i'm

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:24,940
going to give it a hostname and we'll

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,690
just call it test and you go ahead and

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,690
set your root password

00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:38,399
you can choose your template and

00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:39,989
currently only have the boon to 12.4 so

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,399
that's the only one I can choose but if

00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:44,819
you the more you download there they'll

00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,559
all show up there you designate your

00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:48,589
resources the way you do in most virtual

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,789
environments will just leave the default

00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:52,859
you can and this is where you get to

00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,159
choose you can either choose a routed

00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:57,869
mode or you can do a bridge mode I

00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:10,379
typically just do routed and just assign

00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:13,949
it an IP address 250 is free I don't

00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:15,959
ever do anything with the DNS because

00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:17,609
I'm mostly working inside of the network

00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:21,149
I very rarely have them even connect to

00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:22,619
the internet so it'd take about 45 to 60

00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,779
seconds for it to actually create the

00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:27,059
container and from there then you're

00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:31,199
actually able to boot up is anybody

00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:32,659
familiar with server product well like

00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:35,519
Linda they're here hosting our

00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:37,709
sponsoring their you they're actually

00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,269
using believe they're using kvm I

00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:46,439
believe are they're not okay they're ok

00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:48,779
the reasons in and another one that we

00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:51,059
that I use at work is digital ocean and

00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,499
they're using kvm but you're because you

00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,929
have these containers you're actually

00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:57,719
able to spin them up just really really

00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:03,089
fast so in the time it took me to say

00:30:57,719 --> 00:31:08,899
that the container is created and and

00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:08,899
now it's in my list and I can start it

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,190
and it's up and it's up and running

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:21,520
we'll come back to this vm r this

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:25,200
container here in just a minute now

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:31,440
let's create a container for our a vm

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:35,170
for I've got a little XP installation so

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,410
the the options for vm are a little bit

00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:41,170
more complicated or you have more

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:47,700
options so we're going to set is windows

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:51,070
XP I've already got the ISO installed so

00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,730
I'll leave everything default I'm going

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:58,000
to bump up the cores because it's

00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:01,360
windows it likes more memory than it and

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,720
processor than it needs and in about the

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,430
same time it'll it'll this will finish I

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,590
in just a few moments that will actually

00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:15,580
create the container it actually says it

00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:20,200
was successful so we'll start it so do

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:26,800
these to the guest OS is perceive x86

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:29,350
virtual hardware yes yes yes he's asking

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,960
is if the the guest operating system are

00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,240
actually seeing the virtualized x86

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,160
hardware and that's then that is and

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,290
this but this particular atom processor

00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:44,830
is they have is a 64-bit and and so it's

00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:47,140
seen as a true 64-bit all the hardware

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,460
if you if actually go into the XP you

00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,170
cannot you don't actually see where it's

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:55,960
a sign the two core it'll it'll see

00:32:50,170 --> 00:33:01,540
exactly what I gave it sees it as an x86

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:04,150
type intelli problem yes yes it is it is

00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,110
a generic processor same thing with AMD

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,900
it doesn't matter who that what the

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:15,870
prodigious sees it as a generic x86 yeah

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:25,110
that is correct yeah yeah

00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:28,350
I don't know I I would hope so I really

00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,880
do because the fact of all the

00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,760
virtualization platforms I've ever used

00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,520
at proxmox to me is the most efficient

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,020
it has the least amount of overhead

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:42,300
proxmox claims that running a kvm on

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,460
proxmox will give you about ninety seven

00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,620
percent of performance compared to bare

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,460
metal I think that's a little bit high

00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,980
to expect but i have seen extremely good

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:56,670
performance whereas some other

00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,740
virtualization solutions not as well and

00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:02,190
so i would love to see them go to the

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,660
ARM processor and in the future I just

00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:12,950
don't know if they have any plans to do

00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:12,950
that well yeah that's I mean yeah

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:47,909
yes it has yeah they were they were

00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:49,899
discussing about the virtual

00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:52,389
capabilities of the ARM processors

00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,550
currently that's I know that's something

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,790
that's in the works I'm not much into

00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:01,300
arm unfortunately so I don't have much

00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:03,310
to add to that conversation you will see

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,050
if you look at in the air con dolor so

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:08,470
you'll see no accelerator found that is

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,869
one drawback to this particular hardware

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:14,950
structure is it the while it supports

00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:17,170
kvm through the instruction set it

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,290
doesn't it doesn't use the accelerator

00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,330
function that's built in to proxmox

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,800
because it just this particular chipset

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,020
doesn't support it but if you have a

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,640
like a 93 or something like that you

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,530
won't you actually won't see the Excel

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,570
no accelerator found and that's what

00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:37,660
it's screaming at me for so I've got

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:40,300
like currently I've got 44 different VMs

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:43,330
here going back to one of your questions

00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:50,130
regarding the kvm and stuff you can

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:55,000
actually let's think give me one second

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:57,970
you can actually come in and in the

00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,320
options you can actually change like

00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,220
right now I've got I've got it set for

00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:07,740
kvm virtualization which i can actually

00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:11,859
disable that because i don't have the

00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:14,770
accelerator almost chipset but you can

00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:19,450
also select a type of disks that use

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:21,250
like a qemu i guess mostly virtual bog

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,599
vmware uses that such so you can

00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,410
actually select the type of disks that

00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:28,720
it's using and then the type of options

00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,400
that you have in like in vmware and and

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,640
other things like that as far as your

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,370
disk

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,290
and then the type of virtualization and

00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:38,990
the controls that you have within kvm

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:41,420
you can also do that when you create a

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:44,510
container so in order you basically

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,930
choose though in a nutshell do I wanted

00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,300
to be container i can run ubuntu in fact

00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,810
will show you i can create a vm of

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,810
ubuntu

00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:29,380
a few things about proxmox is the fact

00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:31,910
that it does support clustering I don't

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,069
use clustering a whole lot of you do

00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,559
have a cluster at home but I don't use

00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:39,709
it a tremendous amount because I don't

00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,449
use the high availability in four in

00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:42,979
order to use a cluster i would i would

00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:44,089
recommend you also using high

00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:46,989
availability but if you're familiar

00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:49,400
coming from an enterprise environment

00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:51,319
with clustering and specifically high

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,150
availability all those functions are

00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:57,369
built directly into proxmox you also

00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:59,989
have the ability to do live migrations

00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:03,499
as well as obviously your backups and

00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:08,650
now your clone features in the latest

00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:08,650
version so let's start this ubuntu box

00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:16,819
proxmox it will support it on a single

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:21,410
node it will support up to a hundred and

00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:24,769
sixty cpu saw our course and one

00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:28,999
terabyte of RAM and the cluster is is

00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:31,939
limited to 16 notes so you know that's

00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:34,640
if you maxed out each node that's that's

00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:38,689
a whole lot of power so there are there

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,329
are some limitations in it as far as the

00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:43,449
scale of the cluster that you can build

00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:47,809
but typically the the maximum heart rate

00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:52,479
in each node is higher than some of the

00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:52,479
other of its competitors allows for

00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:13,980
proxmox does offer a they have a

00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:16,320
java-based VNC console that actually

00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,410
works most of time really well there's

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,750
there's a it doesn't work well on a Mac

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,790
but that's due to apples not wanting to

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:31,200
use the latest java for security reasons

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:34,880
and things come on and of course it a

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,880
lot of demo it's not going to work ever

00:39:49,990 --> 00:40:01,220
do forgive me so yeah this is this is

00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,750
this is proxmox and a nutshell I don't I

00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,630
haven't used this in an enterprise

00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:08,359
environment although I do know some

00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,160
people that are I mostly use it to do

00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:14,060
exactly what you see I built a bunch of

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:17,980
nodes various operating systems various

00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:22,160
functionalities file servers FTP servers

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:24,020
Active Directory ldap openldap something

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,550
like that so that I can get in and

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,160
actually run a bunch of network

00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:31,550
penetration testing figure out the

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,070
vulnerabilities can blow up XP boxes

00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:37,190
especially sp2 like like it's no

00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:40,220
business and it allows me to do this in

00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:42,530
a controlled environment that I didn't

00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,050
have the ability to do very few people

00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:49,190
in here can say well how many people

00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:53,000
have windows server 2008 2003 to boone

00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:54,770
two servers for XP boxes to windows

00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,609
seven pro box is running at their house

00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:00,320
right now and that's the thing is it

00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:03,020
gave me the ability to actually have a

00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,210
lot of resources and a small environment

00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,190
and if I don't need something I turn it

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,560
off if I destroy him if I break

00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,990
something make it so that it son run-up

00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,530
runnable which happens a lot and windows

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:17,180
I just pull it down start scratch on

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,950
back up in just a couple of minutes so

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:23,180
it's a really really versatile

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:26,840
environment that I went to navigated to

00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,240
over proxima I mean a virtual box

00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,020
because that's what I was using before

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,030
because it just has its natural

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,520
limitations I'm running on an operating

00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,320
system so I've got all that overhead and

00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,930
it's just chugging along and so now I

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,859
can have one dedicated box I can take my

00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:47,090
router and my proxmox server and I can

00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:48,619
take it anywhere plug it up and I can be

00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,960
doing my work I can do what I would I

00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,739
enjoy doing and I didn't have that

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,319
ability before

00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:58,390
so that's that's how i use proxmox in a

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,449
networking an open-source networking lab

00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:04,989
this met a need for me it's not the

00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:07,089
ideal solution for everybody but if

00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:13,049
you're like me and have the philosophy

00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:15,699
it's free it's for me um I that's I

00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:23,049
don't know what it just did of Java's

00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:30,039
finally trying to come up so is there

00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:34,469
any questions about I we I used I came

00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:37,209
out of a VMware environment and so

00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:39,640
looking at the capabilities of vmware

00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:41,319
had I was just absolutely amazed because

00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,229
like this is the coolest thing ever like

00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:48,509
having we condensed from 16 racks of

00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:51,099
servers down to two racks of servers and

00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:53,829
10 month window at the company I was

00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:56,769
that and that was I was just amazed to

00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:58,150
sit here see how powerful virtualization

00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:01,109
was because we just had wasted a lot of

00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,109
wasted space question

00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,080
I've been using cintas kvm with what

00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:15,370
would be the advantage of this over that

00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:18,460
um I haven't used resent us kvm repeat

00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,950
okay his question was he's using centos

00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:25,870
kvm and what's the advantages of proxmox

00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:27,340
over that I've never used centos kvm so

00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:30,700
I'm not a hunter I can't say for sure

00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,040
one big advantage that proxmox has and

00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,630
i'm not sure if centos does as well but

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,930
especially compared to the other other

00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:39,340
virtualization platforms is this is the

00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,220
management console you don't have to

00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:45,700
have a second dedicated unit what with

00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,470
VMware you have to have a vcenter and

00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,440
you either install that on a physical

00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,840
server or a virtual server that it's

00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,540
actually controlling which always kind

00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,980
of just baffles me a little bit but you

00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,350
have to have a separate box to manage

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,390
that you don't with prox box it is it

00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:05,260
say it is its own management interface

00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:07,750
and so that that's one advantage as far

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,450
as the comparison that centos I'm just

00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:13,230
not sure I haven't used it if it's if

00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:17,620
it's a standard implementation of kvm

00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:20,530
you get the nice pretty GUI and that and

00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:23,740
that helps a lot it's being able to see

00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:28,780
what's going on it easily modified I can

00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:36,160
go in and take one of these themes here

00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:39,420
and I can really yeah it's locked it's

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:45,360
actually completely locked up that is

00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,360
unfortunate stay tuned next time

00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:58,990
all right yeah well nope it's still come

00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:02,110
on let's close out yeah I've got a lot

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:04,450
I've got a lot of VMs spun up and and

00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:08,170
I'm also running on a VPN and everything

00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:13,570
else so I don't connect open networks so

00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:19,330
I don't trust them on this box right

00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:23,950
here um oh the limitation it's 1000 you

00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:25,150
can maintain 1000 VMs on a single note I

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,490
don't want to want to know what the

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,680
hardware specs for a thousand VMs are

00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,230
now but not only if you're running a

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,870
thousand containers that's actually not

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:38,670
that bad I mean it's mostly containers

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:41,530
are using less than 500 megs of space

00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:44,410
you can run because you can run linux on

00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,670
such a lightweight plat you know you can

00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:48,100
give it two hundred fifty six megs of

00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:51,040
ram and one cpu core and it's going to

00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,420
it's going to be happy all day long so

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,760
if you're using container based

00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:58,240
virtualization you can really start to

00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,730
stack the number of the VMS or

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,990
containers that you're running and i am

00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:07,590
just going to get out actually Firefox

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,590
is locked up

00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:19,840
so we'll jump in a chrome really you did

00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:22,360
you get that your user interface instead

00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:27,190
of birdmen just does more stuff

00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:32,820
management was very more I you always

00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:40,570
did used to mail I safari well yeah and

00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:46,690
obviously you vote it's a lot easier

00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:49,180
manage on the deal with Olivia to get a

00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,040
console is pretty crucial which you can

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,650
do with verse theoretically we've got a

00:46:51,040 --> 00:47:00,220
man you're actually using bursts Paul

00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:02,830
next in line I'm mostly climbers useful

00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,690
for if I've got the shell into remote

00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:07,000
box and I have extremely limited

00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:11,170
bandwidth and all I do is just be like

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,630
first start with an idea that is easier

00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:18,100
Avengers one of the nice things that men

00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:21,550
so bro nice thing about working in

00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:23,470
tourism basically sparked as it is I

00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,360
didn't have much exported until i

00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:28,660
realized that i use it to connect to

00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,680
multiple hosts over ssh and manage all

00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,680
of them at once with a tree

00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:56,890
what well yet the and and that's that's

00:47:53,320 --> 00:48:00,400
one of those things that you're doing in

00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:02,500
command line correct and that they can

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,760
get into a heated linux discussion GUI

00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,700
versus command line and stuff like that

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,470
but a bit the biggest deal for me as it

00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,020
the point in time that I really jumped

00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,540
into this I was still a newbie and I

00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:17,950
still classify myself as a young gun in

00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:19,870
Linux and it catered to me because it

00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,120
had a GUI and I could look at it and I

00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,910
knew exactly what I was doing or I could

00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,800
figure out exactly what I needed to do

00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,360
now that I've got this under my belt

00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,850
I've gone back to the command line which

00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,460
is actually a whole lot simpler I mean

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:36,250
it's you want to create a new new

00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:38,290
container it's you just run PvE create

00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:42,640
give it the container number and the

00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:46,330
template enter and it it does the same

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,040
it does the same process that you're

00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,300
seeing in the GUI the difference is i

00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,530
don't know if i will say i want to go

00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:55,930
change of the IP address on on a vm

00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:59,470
through so I've got you i can add

00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:02,110
cessation to it and i can do all that or

00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:07,240
i can just do in the GUI just change the

00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:09,810
IP address and it it handed sends it off

00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,810
the out food

00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:19,740
yes I I I like it for the two things the

00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,990
user interface is very nice especially

00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:25,050
come from where it came from in 1.7 when

00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:28,920
I started to now this is much more of a

00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:31,140
a vmware ish kind of look than structure

00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,430
the way it is previously it was a lot

00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:37,349
more convoluted but the fact that I was

00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:40,470
able to figure out what I was doing in

00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:41,730
the interface without any documentation

00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,950
i haven't do a lot of research to

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:48,680
figured out that was one plus but also

00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:48,680
it gave me the ability to choose kvm or

00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:54,000
opened easy containers I could choose I

00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:58,530
mean if I like said I can I can install

00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,280
10 a boon to servers on this box or i

00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:03,599
can install windows 7 you know and that

00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,790
comes down to the operating system but i

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,190
have that option and so i can create a

00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:10,680
windows seven box i can create my tensor

00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:14,640
one boon to servers and i can spend them

00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:18,180
up it's fast is whenever I need them the

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,589
thing with me personally is I needed the

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,060
ability because I was pulling machines

00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:23,010
up and down up and down because I was

00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,010
going after a specific attack vector

00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:28,230
whether it was either a Java or

00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:31,319
something something else within my

00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:34,619
network testing so I wasn't deploying

00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:37,710
fifty to a hundred dm's at a time I was

00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:40,470
spinning up one or two for very specific

00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:43,530
reasons and then i can destroy them and

00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:45,119
so that's why proxmox was just a home

00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,430
run for me because it gave me that

00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,780
capability and it's really really simple

00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:53,700
to use it's very very very intuitive

00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,579
once you jump in you just go oh you just

00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,650
start figuring things out and that's the

00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:00,990
that's the advantage over everything

00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:04,050
that I've used I and I haven't used a

00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:06,510
tremendous amount because I'm kind of

00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:08,730
stuck in my ways it worked it hasn't

00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,339
broken for me so I just haven't ventured

00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:15,119
out to that to other things such as in

00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:17,460
and stuff like that but but it all comes

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,660
down about usability for the end user if

00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,150
you're more comfortable in the command

00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,420
line proxmox probably digital probably

00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,960
not a whole lot of advantage

00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,490
two for you because now you can run this

00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,710
completely command line if you would

00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:32,740
like to but you don't have to you have

00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,839
you have those options and it was cool

00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:38,530
because instances i was able to learn

00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,180
how to run things like VPN servers on a

00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,880
verte in a virtual environment that

00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,319
takes some unique networking and because

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,150
everything all the adapters and stuff

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,210
for virtualized so you've got to do some

00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:51,400
bridging and stuff and and that's so

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:53,020
I've used proxmox is probably one of my

00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,790
biggest learning tools over the last two

00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:59,799
years is in everything both in network

00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:01,450
testing and both just in my personal

00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:03,579
development of my linux skills

00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,410
networking skills and stuff it always

00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,359
has existed in this platform everything

00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,309
I've done stick it behind a router that

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,260
I control that I can do anything I can

00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:15,640
for my ports I can do anything I want to

00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,740
with it and and now I have it's it's

00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,710
exactly what I need it to be it may not

00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,549
be the perfect solution for you guys

00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:23,740
depending on what you're wanting to do I

00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:27,010
mean this is a this is a playground for

00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:30,069
me where most people use proxmox and

00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:33,369
stuff like that as you know sensitive

00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:35,049
data production environments enterprise

00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:38,829
environments where they're running real

00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:42,150
machines real databases and stuff I use

00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:44,920
it to play around and to break things

00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:48,849
but it's it's I it's absolutely ideal

00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:53,589
for that you want to run a PBX server

00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:58,000
and a VPN server and somebody throw out

00:52:53,589 --> 00:53:00,430
something out there to me huh okay yeah

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,440
anything I can actually set up all these

00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,520
and what you know I'm not married and

00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,260
this is something I'm going to have to

00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,790
deal with later I have a I have an

00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,170
entire rack of equipment that i know

00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:14,260
will probably go away the day i get

00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:15,579
married right yeah yeah yeah and if i

00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,430
want to get married you probably need to

00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:20,319
get yeah it probably will want to go but

00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:22,240
the awesome thing is hardware as

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,640
hardware expands and we get more

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,770
capability my rack is actually getting

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,540
smaller and smaller and smaller because

00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,970
in the last few years money's hasn't

00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,799
changed I need to be able to run because

00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:35,410
there's still so many companies that are

00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,250
running windows XP don't know wha well

00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:39,640
actually I dunno

00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,560
but I still use XP for my testing

00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,170
environment a lot of times so my needs

00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,310
haven't changed but mark my footprint

00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,320
has gotten smaller and smaller smaller

00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:49,510
as I just keep upgrading the box the box

00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:53,440
right now is an i7 with 32 gigs of ram

00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:57,540
and 4 terabytes of storage and I can run

00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:01,780
I typically at any given time will run

00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:03,100
six or seven VMs at one time and most of

00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,070
those most of those going to be windows

00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:10,680
and then I just connect to the to the

00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:14,290
router wirelessly and it's open season

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:16,570
so and if anybody's curious as to all

00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:22,570
these networks things of testing and

00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:24,640
stuff sunday at eleven-thirty I believe

00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:27,610
I'm doing a conversational don't be a

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,390
target and it's it's much more fun than

00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:34,210
this it's essentially some of the

00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:36,900
dangers that exist in by connecting to

00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:39,520
open networks such as the self network

00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:44,770
although i'm sure the self network is

00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:47,110
just fine but a lot of what I've learned

00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,610
and what I'm going to be presenting came

00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:51,940
directly out of the research that I was

00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:54,000
able to do in proxmox so any other

00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,000
questions

00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:10,130
I've only ever run one just because it's

00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:11,870
it's been isolated he was asking what

00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,590
are the limitations on how many networks

00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:19,400
you can run and I've also only ran 11

00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:22,070
Nick as well you can actually proxmox

00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:29,720
will support up to 16 network our

00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:34,040
interfaces I believe yes yes yeah you

00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,600
can and I run I run mine as a in a

00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,300
bridge mode so that my router is

00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,940
actually doing all of the routing you

00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,130
can also do it in it has its own NAT

00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,990
inside of it with the issue with that is

00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,360
I can't connect to it externally from

00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:49,910
with my laptop and I want to be able to

00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,610
run wireless tether you know packet

00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:55,100
captures so I've hooked it up run it as

00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:56,300
a bridge mode through the router so the

00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,890
router is actually routing all the

00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,670
packets so I can actually sniff the

00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:03,260
packets and all that fun stuff I

00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:08,390
actually I use one of the routers in my

00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:12,010
company we have currently I've got a HSN

00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:14,290
66 you but I've used everything from

00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,450
trendnet Belkin it doesn't matter

00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:19,210
because it's I just I just need it to

00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,380
have a wireless networking route

00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,760
obviously things like port forwarding

00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,220
and stuff I do like to have the ability

00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,780
to do that for my network testing

00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,600
because you'd be surprised how many

00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:33,290
companies have ports wide open that

00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,400
should never be open ever and they're

00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,740
just sitting there on the on the

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,960
internet so I like to try to simulate

00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:41,090
that as much as possible so i will throw

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,910
random really really bad network

00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:46,460
configurations and firewalls onto the

00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:48,890
router to see how i can get through them

00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:51,320
and bypassing and stuff like that one

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:53,840
fun thing to do is to tunnel from ipv6

00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,880
down to ipv4 a lot of routers don't know

00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,630
what to do with that so it just puts it

00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,980
through port 80 so you can always get in

00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:03,010
there there's some interesting things

00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:07,330
that I've learned as a result of

00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:09,160
of using proxmox it's a phenomenal you

00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:13,060
said I get academic for me this is a

00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:16,750
purely educational platform because it

00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:18,250
is taught me not everything I know but a

00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,510
lot of what I've known and it's we'd be

00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,520
giving me the ability to simulate

00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,710
real-world applications I could actually

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,990
go to somebody say this is what could

00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:30,540
happen to your network and watch them

00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:30,540
prom and that's that's that's nice

00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:37,420
because it's open source uh-huh know it

00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,750
and like I said this is this is how i

00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,340
use proxmox it's one hundred percent not

00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,800
it's actually intended purpose they

00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:49,420
designed it to go into an enterprise to

00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,310
replace things like vmware and then have

00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:55,540
at it and go to I know that it's more

00:57:51,310 --> 00:58:01,380
than capable enough to do that but I

00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:05,830
think especially as a my techno lust

00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:07,510
wants me to use utilize the technology

00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:12,070
that's available there's no reason that

00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:14,020
this just has to exist in in the

00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,580
enterprise level the one of the things

00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,890
we're doing it my company is worth

00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:20,680
developing a new x86 routing platform

00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:23,160
and part of the the whole idea behind

00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:26,410
this thing is it's why I have all this

00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,540
really powerful hardware only available

00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:31,690
at this certain level when you're you

00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:33,760
know running data centers and stuff why

00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,980
not bring it down to the average user

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,710
it's available it's just nobody's taking

00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:40,510
the time to do it and so with proxmox

00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:44,800
it's like I have this really really

00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:46,900
powerful open-source platform that was

00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,470
designed to do this but I'm going to go

00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,510
over here and do this with it and that's

00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:57,580
that's that's proxmox for me i love it i

00:58:52,510 --> 00:59:02,260
use it almost every single day so have

00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:06,910
fun any other questions sorry all the

00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:08,830
demos to swim you know there it's and

00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,310
I'm terrified that the next session is

00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,310
going to be worse

00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:22,840
so it's interactive you can't you can

00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,530
your customers rely on your website or

00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,900
application if it's slower

00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,840
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,670
and costs you money keeping your

00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,160
business critical systems humming along

00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:44,010
requires insight into what they're doing

00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,990
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:48,240
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:50,400
resource limitations and other problems

00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,349
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,930
your systems performance metrics in

00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:57,780
real-time and record this data for later

00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:59,760
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,799
see what's really going on under the

00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,930
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:05,910
visualize the status of all your systems

01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,640
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:11,760
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,460
memory swap processes load and network

01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,799
usage click a specific system to access

01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,809
its individual dashboard then click and

01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:21,809
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:00:18,809 --> 01:00:23,789
more detail comprehensive network data

01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:26,490
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:28,079
is available on the network tab and disk

01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,970
rights and free space on the disk

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,819
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:35,369
displays usage statistics for individual

01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:37,530
processes the system info tab shows

01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:39,780
listening services active connections

01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:41,910
and available updates adding long view

01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,589
to a system is easy just click the

01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,750
button copy the one line installation

01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:48,180
command then run the command on your

01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,890
linux system to complete the process the

01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,049
agent will begin collecting data and

01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:53,910
sending it to longview then the graph

01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:56,490
start rolling

01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:58,859
use longview to gain visibility into

01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:02,599
your servers so when your website or app

01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:02,599
heats up it stays up

01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:48,710
most enterprises today realize that

01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,329
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,700
enough to keep their networks saved from

01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:54,770
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,809
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:58,940
popular lately that adds that extra

01:01:56,809 --> 01:02:01,609
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,349
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:02:01,609 --> 01:02:05,569
know is that some two-factor

01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:07,790
authentication solutions they're better

01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:10,819
than others like two-factor strong

01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:13,099
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:15,049
beyond other authentication systems by

01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:18,349
being less expensive easier to implement

01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:20,599
and easier to use getting software based

01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:23,450
token clients built to run on all major

01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:26,049
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:28,400
Android these tokens utilize a

01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:30,859
public/private key combination that's

01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,750
generated an on device so there are any

01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:35,270
shared secrets flying around for

01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:38,119
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:39,980
special handling instead all keys are

01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,440
kept secure and private between the

01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:44,630
requesting token and your server which

01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,270
you control a mouse making it the most

pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:43,170
happening in open source the

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,000
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:47,100
of the community and the speed at which

01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,110
these are these you know these these

01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,420
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:54,000
discovered and then fixed is it like

01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:56,730
that really shows the power of the you

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,350
know of the open source community it is

01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:02,550
global and it's definitely because of

01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:08,880
the users community people are extremely

01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:10,800
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,050
go on tire see any day you'll see these

01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,780
guys helping each other out and they're

01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:17,490
all doing it like in a selfless manner

01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:20,480
the product is transparent for everyone

01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:23,430
everyone can look at the code base

01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,140
everyone can see how growth darkest is

01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:31,020
being built nothing nothing is

01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:33,660
proprietary everything is open in many

01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:37,860
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:41,640
ongoing health cloudstack the most

01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:45,519
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:48,189
was our first developer boot camp

01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,829
and our call gave people I gave me two

01:04:48,189 --> 01:04:54,789
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:58,959
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:04:54,789 --> 01:05:01,809
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:04:58,959 --> 01:05:04,329
chairs into the room twice everything

01:05:01,809 --> 01:05:07,659
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:05:04,329 --> 01:05:10,659
is open source and so I don't think that

01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:12,399
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:05:10,659 --> 01:05:15,429
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:18,159
computing and so i think it's i think

01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:19,509
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:20,619
about cloud computing you're really

01:05:19,509 --> 01:05:26,169
talking about open source cloud

01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:29,319
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:31,719
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:35,619
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:38,289
each data centers these hardware is

01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:41,769
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:44,499
to handle number one that mass scale

01:05:41,769 --> 01:05:47,649
number two it's designed to handle the

01:05:44,499 --> 01:05:50,529
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:54,729
deployments started working on contact

01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:57,969
over four years ago and it was the

01:05:54,729 --> 01:05:59,769
original set of people working on it had

01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:03,880
a background of delivering software

01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:08,109
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:11,739
lots of users actually using it high

01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:14,799
availability is the key feature multiple

01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:16,989
hypervisors support different network

01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:19,989
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:21,759
better while step management server can

01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:25,449
be deployed in different physical

01:06:21,759 --> 01:06:27,099
machines it definitely has a huge

01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:32,109
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:34,689
there's a major movie studio that they

01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:37,869
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:39,969
to transcode video and i thought that

01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,589
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:06:39,969 --> 01:06:44,859
more fascinating is what they did during

01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:47,649
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:49,540
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:06:47,649 --> 01:06:51,720
lunch was over they would destroy lbs

01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:55,150
Susan go back to doing real work

01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,650
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,540
different aspects and there's no one

01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:01,180
person that's kind of like a master of

01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:04,960
all those realms I think clouds stack as

01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:07,210
a project is going to be one of the

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,260
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:16,690
most feature fallen and and robust

01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:19,620
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:19,620
living through the clouds dag

01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,460
you

01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:42,880
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:44,830
ago we could not have imagined that

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,020
asterisk would not only become the most

01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,180
widely adopted open source communication

01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:51,190
software on the planet but that it would

01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:53,710
impact the entire industry in the way

01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:55,690
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:58,330
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:00,280
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:02,410
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,790
transition of power from the hands of

01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:06,070
the traditional proprietary phone

01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:08,470
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:10,540
administrators of phone systems using

01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,190
this power our customers have traded all

01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,260
sorts of business changing applications

01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:16,060
from small office phone systems to

01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:18,160
mission-critical call centers the

01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,990
international carrier networks in fact

01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,460
there's even an entire country those

01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:23,710
communications infrastructure runs on

01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:25,840
esters the gym has always been about

01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:27,550
creating technology that expands

01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,740
communications capabilities in ways that

01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,910
we could never have imagined and that's

01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:33,310
part of what's game-changing about

01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:36,010
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:38,110
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:40,210
IP phones that extends control of the

01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:41,980
user all the way to the desktop the

01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,690
launch of these new products represents

01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:45,670
the next phase indigenous history of

01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:48,190
innovation these are the first and only

01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:49,900
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:51,460
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,470
our expectations for building a family

01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,630
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:57,370
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,020
the team to build the phones such that

01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:01,210
they were easy to install integrate

01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,070
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:05,620
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:07,240
that goal user feedback is validating

01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,370
that when it comes to operation with

01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,800
Astra space systems including our own

01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:14,380
Switchvox based product these are the

01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:15,670
easiest to use best integrated most

01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,250
interoperable products on the market

01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:20,260
today the digitally of phones will

01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:22,300
initially include three IP desk phones

01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:24,250
uniquely designed to complement any

01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:26,110
asterisks or switch box based solution

01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:28,780
these phones are different for a number

01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:31,450
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,860
designed for use with asterisks secondly

01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:34,320
we've made it really easy to

01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:36,880
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,560
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,589
to access information inside of

01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,500
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:44,489
between an application and the phone

01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,650
additionally we've created an

01:09:44,489 --> 01:09:48,779
applications engineer that allows users

01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:51,989
and developers to create and run their

01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:53,790
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:09:51,989 --> 01:09:55,739
done all of this at a very compelling

01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,389
price point at Digium we're always

01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:59,520
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:09:57,389 --> 01:10:02,040
the best value in business phone systems

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,630
and also give them the power to create

01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,760
their own solutions or any

01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:07,500
communications challenge well continue

01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,909
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,980
Astra's cooler faster and more

01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:12,599
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,060
asterisk employed communications even

01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:18,770
easier and together we'll change the way

01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,770
