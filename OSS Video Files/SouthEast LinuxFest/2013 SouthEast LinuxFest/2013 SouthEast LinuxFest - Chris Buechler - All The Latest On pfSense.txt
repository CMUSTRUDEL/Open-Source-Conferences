00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,390
the following diamond sponsors in 2013

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:30,080
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,080
whatever CSS

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:49,830
project later we're pretty sea-based

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:51,570
firewall to fire all around Hooda

00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,330
managed to be one of their faces or

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,650
actual a katana you figure in American

00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:01,850
publishing here navigating 2-pointer if

00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,800
a surprise with flashing you should

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,590
follow us it's sort of simplex alpha

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:12,560
which is very easy back up in your solar

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:17,250
system like certification candy bar seal

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,520
deployment you're coming 2004 originally

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:26,420
support of ottawa models graces of

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,650
harmony towards the smaller man still

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,340
come by flash card

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:36,900
who's invited my knees in lunar

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:46,410
saleability so we started with the exam

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:49,770
only focus encounter between the and any

00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,680
comes from making sense of PF for lack

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:58,140
of anything better than that domains

00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:02,220
above initially I was a good sermon he

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:07,950
handed the communities Merced it's a

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,990
become popular with that person is a

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,150
poison that are certainly people who

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,420
have contributed significantly not

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:20,610
actually being murdered code is the code

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,459
base near a 200-foot to UCB have

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,300
rebuilding a lot of people come along

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,300
make murky quests

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,670
the moving data greatly increase in fact

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:41,629
you should you got from from a second

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:44,359
it's so easy to city changes because the

00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:49,159
positive every new Gotham CBS 2 years

00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:53,060
back and thus asset along atoms on a

00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:58,989
variety of sort projecting breakfast or

00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:02,239
water source easily over 174,000 of my

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:07,780
installations we can count the number of

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:11,180
posts that paper on our side of it what

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:15,859
kind of number unique public eye he's at

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:19,790
the pet shop 50 at least mental issues

00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:25,489
out there the other case finish two

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:28,340
summers lease and we have several

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,819
platforms available lead the livecd the

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,790
news anchor basically same data formats

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:39,470
lousy

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:45,400
is the same function is Faruqi flash

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,400
drives issues Jeff bastard right out

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:56,600
and you can actually run from those

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,990
long-term really summer most what I've

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:04,450
learned long term often those three

00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,450
remain what you can do is basically

00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:12,020
Naomi's conversions and fitted for a

00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:15,400
head clash kept we'd only have the most

00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:19,729
societies memory

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,090
so it's part of a compact flash on many

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:26,060
platforms said to that that that is

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:31,610
their primary circuit option also used

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:36,860
with the USB flash drives or a sort the

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:40,490
partner and it'll be a lounge or club by

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:47,270
ice makes easier to importance it virgin

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:52,760
boxes I most of all that is done by

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:59,300
people in court we squirt velvet and

00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:02,030
other services oh portas assembler we

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,449
started a venir a typical worker fire

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:09,190
hall / yourself support of several years

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:13,300
ago and both sides

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:19,200
our score because that's what better fit

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:21,910
or for what we do a lot of things on

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,390
fire Alden people start out in the

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:29,580
finals it targets anonymization picture

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:34,270
there no problem and we're capable of

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:39,900
those things but turning that flat

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,900
purpose all khakis difficult a task

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:47,530
versus two out of threes least efficient

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,210
say release the fruit that one base just

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:55,450
about the name is released and do that

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,150
were detectives at least an eight to

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,910
three weeks ago that's a pretty see that

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:05,530
through basic prior to taking over 20

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:11,790
expertise ip64 game pretty much every

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:14,550
area system and wholeness of mineralogy

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:23,970
one of the coldest use google to got one

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:27,960
site here's another order 506 peace and

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:33,030
you've a wide range of users pretty much

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:39,240
every imaginable industry one of the

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:41,540
area most of it is hiring requirements i

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,430
want any publication environments where

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,280
course files that scale up the large

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:52,950
numbers of the actions are extremely

00:06:47,280 --> 00:07:02,670
expensive where you can do about once a

00:06:52,950 --> 00:07:05,840
fertile area and some loss employment

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,850
environment like that before Randy

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,190
reading 6 7 billion side of these

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,780
connections and that's uh that's okay

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,310
look 45 overall cost of necessities

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,240
persistence and more benign disease is

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,760
twice that so for two thousand boxes you

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,760
happy you couldn't want to be basically

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:33,020
a house

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:37,300
fire so why do you have sex versus just

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,790
going appear on the set yourself there's

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,880
she can be AC system that can figure out

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:47,900
later I propose there's a whole

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:52,670
opportunity the interaction between all

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:57,080
the various pieces is weird barcode what

00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:00,620
it does just write one of the small

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,270
portion with the wires code certain

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:10,790
things that happened when other things

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:15,500
happen so it just needs may be tipsy

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:24,830
don't have to worry about how the piece

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:27,560
of the pie recipe and a lot of hardcore

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,910
PC as in bring our own are all the

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,070
theater and made way come around to

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,580
understanding how a nicety attack system

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,110
that more people keep warm and tight

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,330
anal

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:51,570
wrong committed PSS they had a whole lot

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:59,120
more people who are before us and pretty

00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:05,730
much my last phases container fire

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:11,550
appropriate each foot place I'm a bit of

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:15,210
a 1916 Adam together and started but too

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:18,780
many years ago and was uh it's been in

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:23,490
production since veterinary medicines

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:27,320
upper two years Santa configured in

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:33,420
production set sorry everyone employer

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:36,930
needs it sighs upon music difficult or

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:43,470
extraction of courage I think that works

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:47,570
for large sources all their production

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:51,660
upsizing lively six cases for two years

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:56,810
all our production colocation facilities

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,810
has been widely six per run two years

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:06,960
and an additional pieces ready in one

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:09,230
second but the i think is it is after

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,600
your 6 finally catching up a little bit

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,120
if I better cope back in two thousand

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,990
greeting pc world if F working or

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,600
expected Donna here at my a thousand

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,750
eight we're finally starting to get

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,060
their consumption Google hit one percent

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:32,220
late last year finally we're seeing

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:37,760
pretty that actually difficult person

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:44,340
outside set up some buried over he said

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:48,130
as a whole is so a small communities the

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:56,800
latest at some interesting

00:10:48,130 --> 00:11:02,200
world you're the quadrant they're there

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:05,950
after 98 feet about four times over a

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,110
year ago it's uh it's really coming it's

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,730
not something we've deployed yet it's at

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,490
least time to start working with an

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,750
annulment be good feel for understand

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,340
what the face of it and some points in

00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,820
killer half of some things that come out

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,920
that require some 6001 being fired at

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,769
that point

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:33,120
I can deploy the purser when opposite

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:36,000
need that know where the scary fairy

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,889
society what is it the same because

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,430
you're really running the same protocols

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:46,199
it with density or your team effort a

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:49,019
cheap easily see our programs running or

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:55,800
some different addressing later three

00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:58,170
and means it's an attractive lady you

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,019
doing things lecture carry the firewall

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:04,230
rules because nappies larger than the

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:10,889
more it's not going to have a self

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:17,190
Experian ism but if you were a model

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:20,399
plan absent one that actually a lot of

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:24,120
access to website require you to send

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,699
186 everybody wears a real public in

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,829
every flat feet so you don't know you're

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:36,899
tired thank you carefully what more care

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:39,149
what what particles that you use and the

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,000
other services are the same sentence

00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:44,610
before is that it's different dependency

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,040
mechanisms were that are different so

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,350
there's no more art but it's now and

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:56,220
compete so there are some changes there

00:12:52,350 --> 00:13:01,680
where there are fishes are security to

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:05,730
be for her to be six maybe exhaustion

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,420
accident what is this new to some nature

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,650
of having sex

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,780
there's so many nurses that game is

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:18,100
sunny scanning entire network of worse

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,090
where r is what number increased they do

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:25,480
saturdays relatively small with the

00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:30,430
potentially per trillion how much I

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,440
pchem continue so in order to part of

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:39,790
our routers that case occurs they keep

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:45,370
them Sam today okay personalized

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:53,280
appointment around so that's it what a

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:57,850
day one run how before the accident and

00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,400
things like Verizon swear anything our

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,410
network become a start-up machines that

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,410
it's rather attractive

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:20,550
who's for several types of the wanker

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:26,370
community six said which is largest said

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:28,770
it before d CB six and all of the end of

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,880
main types of ipv6 have pretty

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:35,940
affiliation different concept can be for

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:41,300
two people delimited a piece issue 100

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:44,600
matter would you actually a real public

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,610
cemetery server and where does

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,650
dynamically assigned at do conciliation

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:55,470
in the profile so you your website

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:58,080
address examples be with the before but

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,180
they've also live in that Creek

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,370
affiliation or something this is

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,980
something that needs of your time or

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:11,130
they bring to sublet season protective

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:16,080
of her career is decency and he also has

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:19,070
a b-flat is safe above configuration

00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,839
which is doing I music firewalls that

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,220
people want babe sighs in Scenario

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:31,030
disorder because you can give to someone

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:38,110
nasan made for a number functions not

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:41,440
fire on the right six in four get

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:48,570
feelings of another option SSM sad

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:56,170
fitness like what her feet away 64 in

00:15:48,570 --> 00:16:06,280
security most of all types of 29 pieces

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:08,730
over with it I mean with that amount of

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,140
work that went into enemies and support

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:16,990
member for things that are still so busy

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:21,460
categories a pretty complicated one who

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,170
is a new way you wanted to work whatever

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,650
you're under here before you could also

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:35,459
figure out those c6 IV game but it

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:40,379
proves well and we were able to complete

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:43,139
glm navy has sports not here but not

00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:50,069
because of computers know that engineers

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:51,540
motorsport quadrants yeah sure exactly

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:56,069
why I apparently it's coming eventually

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:59,129
it is most other saying but then it is

00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:04,790
as a whole if I mean changes actually

00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:04,790
with v6 because rather than a final your

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,370
public IP breakfast idea and interview

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,339
and what that z2 basis of the code

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:17,189
rather than just bugger also but as soon

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:24,329
as I provider start supporting a beauty

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:31,460
as well the foundation together on

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,460
software that uses that purty

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:40,659
as you say sir ladies

00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:14,629
yeah I wouldn't say that recently before

00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:17,179
a long time you because 86 or because

00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:20,449
they Harbor that's not supported me that

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:29,119
one makes the lemonade with with people

00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:32,509
are you can pack boo basing your running

00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:37,239
mate snapshots is if a particular set of

00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:39,499
God days legit whether or not I thought

00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:44,029
multi-part changes in the middle of it

00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:48,349
so that particular or is a not even for

00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:50,749
what you're doing so yeah if you catch

00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:53,559
the particular morning reporter RC label

00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,559
and works

00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:15,909
we have a trading out of the idea for

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:24,649
configuration just one any all the

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:31,629
bright be suspected bc v6m plan and then

00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:34,399
if you go to blame weary happening with

00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:39,559
pretty silly ation just juiced it back

00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:40,669
in your face facing wall jack and what

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,980
are some that come to see that

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:47,960
reconciliation little bit on matter be

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:50,320
sorry to that energy arises and vocals

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,320
on this

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:26,020
or as well as the Yankee version know

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:35,690
where your before not all the purples

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:38,679
both of them are UTC so that was your

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,679
figure

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:53,220
neck or doing doesn't exist when you

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,080
have any teeth that were prefix anguish

00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,909
which is a bit of a simple one one that

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,179
is on the entire subnet the prior in

00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:08,279
this case is different subnet and

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:14,039
translated to different one to be nice

00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:17,309
so if you're a small home network the

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:25,990
activity or the resources required to

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:31,019
give your own from aaron berger and it

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:33,730
had a global routing table maze requires

00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:36,639
expensive interconnections that may or

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,470
may not be practical and english

00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:40,470
narratives assault multi-home networks

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:58,950
the shakes I should translate me the

00:21:48,840 --> 00:22:02,790
first of these lands like these things

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:13,830
you put in a transitional into whatever

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:16,530
your internal prefixes it is the only

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,789
kind of that we have three 6 molar

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,779
facility

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:28,379
the air support there is no medical form

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:31,830
that that's something really breaks em

00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:35,669
in I'd be like to be managed with a hack

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:40,999
that was designed for the head of IP

00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:45,659
addresses and that's no longer this

00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:51,419
required or to be so anything won't be

00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:55,820
good there can be some legit reason that

00:22:51,419 --> 00:23:01,159
primarily Robbins is broken what

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:06,330
anything what interface to our basic

00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:09,739
operation around to be sorts of it that

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:13,700
reason they usually have the typical

00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:19,169
many what madness is having before them

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:22,169
if or when we have incurred

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,169
before

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:46,800
and changing some more ways to what you

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,790
saw there is now in addition adding

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,790
before

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,830
like

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,710
packages

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:47,890
what I see is around

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:44,450
which was a tractor wizard yeah there's

00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,450
attention validation

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,170
changed

00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,280
there's a

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:20,429
ingredient for the back out on drivers

00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:24,470
and so I think everybody

00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,470
the ones that are yeah

00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:58,489
there were none of to that one came

00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:03,619
wrapped up for making plans for 422

00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:06,649
Buddhist in the courtesies maintain the

00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:10,969
biggest anything or is a uniform you see

00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:12,469
came late and that's not release yet so

00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:14,419
what kind of working here on and off the

00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:20,359
processes for DC's were complete develop

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:23,889
process well separate a lot of the spca

00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:28,579
p.m. working with committed their

00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:32,989
vehicles or whaaat only just really

00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:36,879
hungry incredible st Sportacus be the

00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:40,009
kernel itself is all kind of single box

00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:48,939
so you can't scale various parts of the

00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:48,939
address gateway reducible will

00:29:50,859 --> 00:30:08,989
but very high violation battery and

00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:14,859
that's in case the horsey because parts

00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:21,649
are people shooting for the third time

00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:28,070
today the degree of disability and why

00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:31,970
are sworn bachelor and is fun imported

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:36,409
and eight urgent work so the clearances

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:39,970
and put a lot of after-hours effort into

00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:44,480
the drivers from all our hard work so

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:49,239
basically everything that exists in some

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,239
onion will we ever be

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:59,410
our spoon in his heart there for Dungey

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,570
private ability we're currently in

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,240
saying is your community oriented one

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:08,360
interface spdm the primary of wonder if

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,770
there's a keyless ignition car body so

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:16,070
you don't have free IDs on all

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:22,910
interesting bully c and partly anything

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:25,930
you detect single IP being used car and

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:28,930
it looks a lot of possibilities well

00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,930
architectures

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,380
like that sort of America Lee bother

00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,960
them too much they're always having some

00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:47,180
peasant some support group easy for our

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:51,280
action could you sign up a lot so we're

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:55,730
not going to do you like that word word

00:31:51,280 --> 00:32:01,520
set above that and having her jammies

00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:04,240
get on some tiny Brown versus working

00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:09,590
every kind of attractive don't each day

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:13,430
but now those are a lot more and

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:18,440
flashing elbows that's a possibility for

00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:21,200
most human genetics aged a lot of other

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,130
what happens is kind of unknown at this

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:32,480
point you're just got our approaches for

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:37,280
DC today partially I'm going because of

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:41,110
these kind of legit and partially let

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,110
alone because what we use

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:50,450
Pop's of tomorrow's upon the ordinary

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:57,380
people say or lose ours then that would

00:32:50,450 --> 00:33:00,920
be release and releasing to determine

00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:06,530
the lot of ten under ten new research

00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:12,740
will probably in the neighborhood we're

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:16,780
here at this point to this in itself but

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,780
we buy came out

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:45,700
the two hours of precious their device I

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:49,810
gave everything my whole yes its box I

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:54,090
did I'm a cpu and memory and interface

00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,090
that but I'll be GD stats

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:21,770
I

00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:37,310
it's but there's bin Laden's basic set

00:34:21,770 --> 00:35:05,840
the negative things that all kinds of

00:34:37,310 --> 00:35:09,670
very yes yes yeah it's the promotion

00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,670
sorry but put it around

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:32,400
sir point the consultants are we will be

00:35:27,090 --> 00:36:01,970
some tourney course ladies year couple

00:35:32,400 --> 00:36:01,970
days what does much more because it may

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,930
baby we gotta satisfy most people you

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,930
surround

00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:49,970
that's something good coming soon

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:59,070
everywhere we remember whispers

00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:04,430
platforms approves el radio appliances

00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,430
that we texted a pilot works it should

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:35,130
it will still work after actually hungry

00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:39,679
that poor Eliza and also gia rules

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:48,409
because it only impact church inform

00:37:39,679 --> 00:38:00,199
users you this early or things like a

00:37:48,409 --> 00:38:00,199
more comprehensive full

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,519
how

00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:48,569
yes this is over there

00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:12,980
thanks for attending we did not too long

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,980
after

00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:37,440
ya know where it is how long travel

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:44,900
dates were you looking I'm awesome so

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,900
it's over by a plus

00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,180
we

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,060
yes

00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,550
the

00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:16,549
it's out of the beautiful liar network

00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:40,420
yeah whatever we started that we realize

00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:40,420
their interfaces

00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,320
p

00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,049
we go

00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,390
something like

00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,260
you

00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,510
like

00:48:50,760 --> 00:49:09,809
starting from 41 comic art Elevens would

00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:09,809
at least be chic and working knowledge

00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,339
how much

00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:54,740
thinking I'm sitting in class the future

00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:58,160
try to do a morning class afternoon

00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,160
because you always

00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:09,380
yes

00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:09,380
stretch three

00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,180
I

00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:18,590
basically yeah there's not really any

00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,590
way

00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,680
Oh

00:53:48,620 --> 00:54:36,170
and so that's why I yeah after you've

00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,170
ever

00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:45,999
there is no way

00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,680
really

00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:26,510
like to see search dialog box that you

00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:30,410
know I type in a sub

00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:34,640
we'll see how about it and then it will

00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:46,420
display the records just for that so is

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:46,420
it your looking glass yeah yeah

00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:18,809
software maybe how max max return yeah

00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,340
Oh

00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:02,210
weather is a love scene

00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,730
just talk

00:57:47,350 --> 00:58:06,460
and that some people will see their life

00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:12,710
t-rex tunics first

00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,590
Oh

00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:50,740
your customers rely on your website or

00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,140
application if it's slower

00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:56,080
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,880
and costs you money keeping your

00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:01,400
business critical systems humming along

00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,710
requires insight into what they're doing

01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,660
your system metrics tells stories

01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:07,670
stories that can reveal performance

01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:10,010
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,570
other problems but how do you keep an

01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:14,210
eye on all of your systems performance

01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:17,240
metrics in real-time and record this

01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:19,010
data for later analysis enter longview

01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,020
the new way to see what's really going

01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:23,180
on under the hood the long view

01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:25,250
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,710
of all your systems providing you with a

01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:31,070
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:33,650
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:35,420
load and network usage click a specific

01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:37,820
system to access its individual

01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,330
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,740
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:44,420
comprehensive network data including

01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,730
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,290
available on the network tab and disk

01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,210
rights and free space on the disk

01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:53,060
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,580
displays usage statistics for individual

01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,770
processes the system info tab shows

01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:59,990
listening services active connections

01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:02,150
and available updates adding long view

01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,830
to a system is easy just click the

01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,990
button copy the one line installation

01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:08,420
command then run the command on your

01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,130
linux system to complete the process the

01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,320
agent will begin collecting data and

01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:14,090
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,700
start rolling

01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:19,070
use longview to gain visibility into

01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:22,810
your servers so when your website or app

01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,810
heats up it stays up

01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:30,799
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,019
ago we could not have imagined that

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,240
asterisk would not only become the most

01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:37,369
widely adopted open source communication

01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,410
software on the planet but that it would

01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:41,930
impact the entire industry in the way

01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:43,910
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:46,519
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,500
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:50,599
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,980
transition of power from the hands of

01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,259
the traditional proprietary phone

01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,660
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:01:54,259 --> 01:01:58,579
administrators of phone systems using

01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,809
this power our customers have created

01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:01,759
all sorts of business changing

01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:03,619
applications from small office phone

01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,900
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,730
the international carrier networks in

01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,529
fact there's even an entire country

01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:11,900
those communications infrastructure runs

01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:14,059
on esters the gym has always been about

01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,769
creating technology that expands

01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:17,930
communications capabilities in ways that

01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:19,130
we could never have imagined and that's

01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:21,500
part of what's game-changing about

01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:24,200
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,299
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,430
IP phones that extends control of the

01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:30,170
user all the way to the desktop the

01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:31,880
launch of these new products represents

01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,859
the next phase indigenous history of

01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,380
innovation these are the first and only

01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:37,730
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,410
power of esther's when we first

01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:41,059
discussed our expectations for building

01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:43,670
a family of phones for use with asterisk

01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:45,440
our requirements were pretty simple we

01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,210
asked the team to build the phones such

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,400
that they were easy to install integrate

01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:51,259
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,809
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:02:51,259 --> 01:02:55,460
that goal user feedback is validating

01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:57,559
that when it comes to operation with

01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:59,990
astro space systems including our own

01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:02,569
Switchvox based product these are the

01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:03,859
easiest to use best integrated most

01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:06,470
interoperable products on the market

01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:08,440
today the Digium family of phones will

01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:10,549
initially include three IP des hommes

01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,440
uniquely designed to complement any

01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:14,329
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,000
these phones are different for a number

01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:19,640
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,079
designed for use with esters secondly

01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,690
we've made it really easy to

01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:25,069
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:26,750
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:28,720
to access information inside of

01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:30,720
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,710
between an application and the phone

01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,840
additionally we've created an

01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:36,970
applications engine that allows users

01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:40,210
and developers to create and run their

01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:41,980
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:43,930
done all of this at a very compelling

01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,609
price point at Digium we're always

01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,710
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:50,230
the best value in business phone systems

01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:51,940
and also give them the power to create

01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,980
their own solutions or eating

01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,690
communications challenge will continue

01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,130
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:59,170
Astra's cooler bastard more

01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:00,790
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:03,280
asterisk and what communications even

01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:06,990
easier and together we'll change the way

01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,990
the world communicates again

01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:24,210
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:26,369
way to better utilize all your resources

01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:29,820
and it makes managing all your resources

01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:33,650
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:37,140
happening in open source the

01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:38,970
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,890
of the community and the speed at which

01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:43,079
these are these you know these

01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:45,390
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,970
discovered and then fixed is it like

01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:50,670
that really shows the power of the you

01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:52,320
know of the open source community it is

01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:56,520
global and it's definitely because of

01:04:52,320 --> 01:05:02,849
the users community people are extremely

01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:04,589
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:06,300
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:05:04,589 --> 01:05:08,160
these guys helping each other out and

01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:11,070
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,900
manner the product is transparent for

01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:16,920
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:19,140
base everyone can see how close that is

01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:24,990
being built nothing nothing is

01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:27,630
proprietary everything is open in many

01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:31,829
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:35,609
unborn health cloudstack the most

01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:39,500
exciting event in recent memory for he

01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:42,170
was our first developer boot camp

01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,810
and our call gave people I gave me two

01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:48,770
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:53,000
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:55,790
with 87 people and had to go get board

01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,310
chairs into the room twice everything

01:05:55,790 --> 01:06:01,550
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:04,640
is open source and so I don't think that

01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:06,380
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,410
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:12,140
computing and so i think it's i think

01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:13,490
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:17,200
about cloud computing you're really

01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:17,200
talking about a source cloud computing

01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:23,540
cloud zac is a robust solution for large

01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:25,940
deployments you have dozens of data

01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:29,960
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:33,230
data centers these hardware is going to

01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:36,440
fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:38,900
handle number one that mass scale number

01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,630
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,910
that inevitably happens in large

01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:47,720
deployments we started working on

01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:51,050
contact over four years ago and it was

01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:53,750
the original set of people working on it

01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:57,860
had a background of delivering software

01:06:53,750 --> 01:07:02,090
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:05,690
lots of users actually using it high

01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:08,780
availability is the key feature multiple

01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:10,790
hypervisors support different network

01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:13,490
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:15,740
you better while step management server

01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:19,430
can be deployed in different physical

01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:21,080
machines it definitely has a huge

01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:26,090
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:28,670
there's a major movie studio that they

01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:31,970
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:33,950
to transcode video and I thought that

01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:35,570
was terribly fascinating what I found

01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:38,840
more fascinating is what they did during

01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:41,630
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,510
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:45,720
lunch was over they would destroy lbs

01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:49,120
sis and go back to doing real work

01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,620
CloudStack is vast it touches so many

01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,510
different aspects and there's no one

01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:55,470
person that's kind of like a master of

01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:58,960
all those realms I think CloudStack as a

01:07:55,470 --> 01:08:01,180
project is going to be one of the

01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:05,230
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:10,690
most feature folan and and robust

01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:13,590
platforms out they were Adams senior

01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:13,590
living through the clouds dag

01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:31,540
most enterprises today realize that

01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,160
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,530
enough to keep their network safe from

01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,600
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:40,060
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,010
popular lately but adds that extra layer

01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:44,650
of protection enterprise networks need

01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:46,510
to stay safe but what you may not know

01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:48,850
is that some two-factor authentication

01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:51,040
solutions they're better than others

01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:54,310
like two-factor strong authentication

01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,350
with wicked wicked goes beyond other

01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,960
authentication systems by being less

01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:01,780
expensive easier to implement and easier

01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,430
to use giving software-based token

01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:06,280
clients built to run on all major

01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,880
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:11,200
Android these tokens utilize a

01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,690
public/private key combination that's

01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,580
generated on device so there are any

01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:18,100
shared secrets flying around for

01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:20,950
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,810
special handling instead all keys are

01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:25,300
kept secure and private between the

01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:27,460
requesting token and your server which

01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:29,100
you control a mouse making it the most

01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:31,780
secure way possible to perform

01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:34,570
authentication encryption and with an
