the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280

linux fest visit w WC selinux phase or

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,810
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,810
2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,750
possible okay well I'm John Rose and I'm

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,219
here sort of with the floor project

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,750
although i'm not exactly speaking on

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:40,440
behalf of the floor project today well i

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,410
am but not in this talk so much I've

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,280
been thinking a lot lately about things

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,570
like where stuff comes from I'm

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,140
especially interested in where

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,000
innovative technologies come from the

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,050
project i work with sort of prides

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,289
itself on leading and developing new

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,430
innovative technologies and you know

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,960
thinking about that in terms of

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,880
governance I'm curious about what sort

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,280
of things go into and creating an

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:18,750
environment where innovative stuff can

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,939
happen so one of the things that's

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,280
interesting about our world today is

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,330
that as we look around at virtually

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,840
anything we have it's really quite a

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,729
wondrous thing right whether it's a cell

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,630
phone or an automobile or an air

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,930
conditioner a microwave oven just all

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,110
the stuff around us this hotel it's a

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,890
fantastic would have been unthinkable

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:50,159
not that long ago in history and one of

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,159
the things that people have noticed for

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,590
a long time is that as this massive

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,909
stuff has accumulated around us we've

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,799
stopped wondering so much and I think I

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,200
think there's a reason for that which

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,940
maybe we'll get to at the end of the

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,500
talk I did I guess as most of you know

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,160
if you read the synopsis of this

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,520
talk it's going to largely be about

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,920
pencils and make sure that at least you

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,130
get something out of the talk I brought

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,280
some pencils there's a second reason for

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,300
that sometimes when I give this talk

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,020
there are young people and they don't

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,580
really use pencils anymore so we'll make

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:42,000
sure everybody knows what a pencil looks

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:44,459
like so back in the 1950s there was a

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,920
libertarian thinker named Leonard read

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:51,940
who wrote an interesting essay called I

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,760
pencil and he wrote the history of a

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,550
pencil or the life story of a pencil in

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,190
the first person as if it was the pencil

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,780
telling the story and from that he drew

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,770
some conclusions and made some

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:10,660
observations and going to share roughly

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:15,880
what those were with you today so I

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,100
don't have a pencil I need a prop so

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,810
pens I I choose a pencil partly because

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,880
of the eye pencil SI but also because

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,680
it's one of the simplest tools that we

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,090
have available today right I mean it's

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,900
hard to think of something simpler than

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,970
a pencil but if we ask a question like

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,930
do we think we could make this pencil

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:40,060
ourself we start to run into problems

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,739
even though it's so simple it's still

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,560
going to be difficult to make ourselves

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,049
so let's look a little bit into what

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,970
goes into a pencil just what's needed to

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,820
construct it there only a few things in

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:55,510
it so we have graphite which is the lead

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,420
part in the middle it might not be pure

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,190
graphite there might be some extra stuff

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,470
mushed in there so it's usually combined

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,049
with clay or wax and a little bit of

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,040
chemical stuff to give it a structure

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:12,540
that's suitable for a pencil we have

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:16,120
usually cedar wood encasing the pencil

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,970
we have an eraser often made out of some

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,890
kind of rubbery substance we have this

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,080
metal ferrell that goes around the

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,790
pencil that's typically made out of

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,640
aluminum

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:30,810
brass there's a few other ingredients

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:34,890
glue varnish lots of varnish actually so

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,540
the pencils pretty if we think about

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,600
some of these items i'm not going to go

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,810
through all of them but here's a picture

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,970
from the the first large deposit of

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,360
graphite that was found and this was

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:52,440
discovered in borrowdale england in

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:56,400
about the year 1500 so it's been around

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,910
for a long time it was just you know big

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,860
chunks of graphite that were suitable

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,410
there were really nice for pencils

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:09,780
because you could saw the graphite into

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:11,340
thin strips and in 1500 pencils weren't

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,440
made out of wood so they were wrapped

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,290
with string or animal hide or something

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,270
else so the pencil the pencil lead

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,270
wasn't a round strip like it is today

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,180
but how do I get this if I want to do

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,190
this today I I don't live in borrowdale

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,340
England and even if I did I probably

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,740
couldn't just walk over and grab some so

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,800
I need to somehow get the graphite from

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,130
somewhere and here's an example of where

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:46,500
it came from in about 1900 so this is a

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,240
graphite mine in salon I think and I

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,870
don't know it's difficult to see from a

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,540
distance but there's this scaffolding

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,270
structure here that goes from the top of

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,150
the mind go to the bottom of the mind

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:03,480
mine and there are people all the way up

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,800
and down it and I presume I don't know

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,050
what they're doing on the scaffolding

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,820
but I presume they're passing the

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,020
graphite from the bottom of the mind to

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,360
the top so in 1900 at least in order for

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,020
me to get graphite I needed the help of

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,880
all these guys and if we think about it

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,150
it's not just these people that we need

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,250
to help help of because how does the

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,770
graphite get from that part of the world

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,960
to the part of the world i'm in so

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,200
there's people that make graphites very

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,610
messy comes off on your fingers so there

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,139
are people that make paper that you've

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,789
wrapped a graphite up in

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,169
so you get a block of graphite you wrap

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,180
it in paper there are other people that

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,719
make string to tie that up all of those

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,939
people are contributing to our pencil

00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:49,830
once it gets out of the mine it has to

00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,889
be put on a ship transported across

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,849
oceans their lighthouse keepers tugboats

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,620
all sorts of other people involved and

00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:03,990
getting just one of the core components

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,360
of this pencil to me cedar trees which

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,129
are used for most pencils are found

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,779
largely in California and Oregon

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,279
although there are other places you

00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,189
could go out in your backyard and find a

00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,449
cedar tree but even if you did could you

00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:20,689
massage it into the shape of a pencil

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,889
that requires some sort of lumber skills

00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,870
right you need to be able to cut down

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,620
the tree or part of the tree probably

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,949
need saws to do that you need to form

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,550
the lumber into some sort of usually

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:39,240
intermediate sort of form which goes off

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,159
to a mill from there go well actually in

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,800
the mill is where it gets put into like

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,110
two by fours or whatever sheets of wood

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,449
that would eventually get sent to a

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,409
pencil factory where it would be refined

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:54,659
into the shape of a pencil again we have

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,639
tons of people involved in getting this

00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:59,099
wood to me just a little piece of wood

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,439
but i can't i can't go pick it up in my

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:06,000
backyard the tip which I mentioned we

00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,759
usually think of it as being made out of

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,589
rubber comes from rubber trees somewhere

00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,210
else in the world this this picture i

00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:18,120
think is from thailand and so some other

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,889
people need to find these trees they

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,699
need to tap them you'll see little

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:27,180
baskets on the sides of the tree those

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:30,089
collect the latex that drips out that

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:35,070
latex has to be again somehow package

00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:37,529
shipped for our use a rubber isn't quite

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,079
enough for the pencil eraser because

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,690
rubber doesn't actually erase anything

00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:45,930
so you have to mix it with pumice or

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,220
some other kind of abrasive substance

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,810
to get something that actually is useful

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,360
as an eraser so again we have gobs more

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,910
people involved in making it possible

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,620
for me to you know buy this pencil for a

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:05,860
few cents the ferrule is made out of

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,320
metal so we have forging involved how

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,060
many of us know how to do that all right

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,590
we need to melt down whatever kind of

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,910
metal we're going to use for the shape

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:18,880
it into the proper structure another

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,550
task that's difficult for most people to

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,160
do and often it's just something none of

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:30,760
us know how to do so some observations

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,540
about this I'm going to skip where glue

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,860
comes room so I'm stopping at the

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:43,200
metalwork but some observation so one is

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:46,540
that the production of this pencil

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,370
involves millions of people really and I

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,230
mean I'm only touching the tip of the

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,050
iceberg of the people who have a hand in

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,400
making it possible right all of these

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,620
people need to be fed when they're

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,300
working they drink coffee at work all

00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,920
that stuff has to be produced other

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,340
places all those people are actually

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,650
helping to make this pencil as well so

00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,570
an interesting question to me is how

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,240
does I mean this is we're talking really

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,180
a massive community of people working to

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:20,160
produce a pencil and how does that

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:24,070
community ever get formed will see that

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,590
it isn't exactly orchestrated from some

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:32,050
governing pencil body right it's

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:35,980
happening outside of that it may not

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:39,070
quite be spontaneously formed but it

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,780
forms in a mysterious way and another

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,650
interesting thing about this community

00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:47,410
is its kind of loose and unstructured so

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:52,390
some components of the community maybe

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:54,760
like you know enemies of other portions

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,070
of the community so you may have you

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,270
know situations where some of the people

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,060
producing one part

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,870
of the pencil would actually just go to

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,210
war if they read into somebody else also

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:11,430
contributing to this pencil so we get

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:14,710
cooperation that kind of goes above

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:19,840
national boundaries and tribal rivalries

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:22,090
and all of those kinds of things part of

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,380
the reason for that is going to be that

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:30,640
these people don't know that they're

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:34,660
cooperating with each other so one of

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,820
the observations that people find most

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,730
interesting is that no one knows how to

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,890
make this pencil and actually there's

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,360
just so many different parts even though

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,760
there's only like maybe six or eight

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,580
components to it nobody knows how to

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,850
make all those things there are people

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,320
who know how to make the metal stuff and

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,750
there are people who know how to take

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,890
care of the lumber aspect of it there

00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,570
are people that know how to take these

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,480
parts and put them together into a

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,860
pencil and actually produce the pencil

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,100
but there isn't any single person who

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,870
knows how to make the whole thing and if

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,840
you think about the bigger picture

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,880
beyond a pencil all the other seemingly

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,430
much more complicated things that we

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:22,030
have around us certainly no one knows

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:26,170
how to make those either I'm going to

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:29,110
come back shortly to what I think is at

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,730
work that that allows things to come

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,460
into existence that no one knows how to

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:38,920
make an important point is that it this

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,440
isn't some sort of masterminded

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,830
operation nobody in a vacuum at some

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,160
point back in history said I think a

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,530
pencil would be a great idea I mean we

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,600
had sort of people drawing and caves and

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:56,770
we had people marking sheep with messy

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,840
things but yeah no one came up and just

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,450
said Oh a pencil that would be a great

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,250
idea now all I need to do is figure out

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,610
how to get these million other people to

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,750
cooperate with me to make it possible it

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,620
couldn't have ever come into existence

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,620
that way

00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,450
so from the chaos of all these other

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,790
people doing all these different things

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,910
a pencil popped out of it as did your

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,190
iPhone if you have one or all the other

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:29,140
your microwave oven all the other stuff

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:31,390
we have around us to me maybe the most

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,220
curious observation about the pencil is

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,050
that while we have billions of the

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,269
manufactured and we have millions of

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:40,120
people somehow involved and producing

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,620
them making them possible no one is

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,180
doing that because they want to have a

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:49,660
pencil if you think about it i mean the

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,450
the people making the ferals that I mean

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,970
they're doing metal work for whatever

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,380
reasons they have to do metalwork it

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,230
happens that they do something that's

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,209
useful to somebody who wants a pencil

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,649
but they're not doing it for them and

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,079
they're not certainly not doing it

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,880
because they want a pencil the people

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,980
cutting down trees in California and

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,510
Oregon not because they want pencils

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,089
even if you think about the guy who runs

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,910
the pencil company he's not doing what

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,160
he's doing because he wants a pencil

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,490
right he's kind of good at business so

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,120
he's running a company pencil just

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,760
happens to be what they make so the

00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,930
takeaway here is that everybody the

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,660
millions of people that we've identified

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,790
as being you know having a hand and

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,649
making pencils possible they're all

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,019
doing what they're doing for their own

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:44,380
reasons and we don't know what all those

00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:46,720
reasons are we sort of know abstractly

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,149
what they are but we don't know

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,339
specifically what they are so I want to

00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:55,829
make a small digression here and my

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,829
digression sometimes aren't that small

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,630
there's a guy named matt ridley who does

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,820
a talk called when ideas have sex and

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:10,260
you should go look this guy up the talk

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:12,370
is short maybe between 15 and 20 minutes

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,490
you'll probably want to watch up more

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,050
than once if you watch it the first time

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,490
because it's a really really good talk

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:23,449
and he looks at the same sort of stuff

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,209
from a slightly different angle

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:30,829
and his talk kind of begins looking at

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:34,359
what happening the question what

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:38,419
happened between the stone age and now

00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:40,579
that change this fact and the stone age

00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:43,249
all the stuff you had around you you

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,109
made yourself so you knew everything

00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:48,649
about it you know how to make it you

00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:50,359
know what was for today virtually

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,879
nothing around this is something that we

00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:55,850
can make most of what's around us we

00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,730
have no idea how it even works right the

00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,939
only thing we know is we can acquire it

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:05,839
we know what purpose it serves we know

00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:08,029
that our toaster toasts a bread and so

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,309
if we want if we want toasted bread we

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,899
buy a toaster and we use it toast bread

00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:20,209
and when it breaks we buy another one

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:23,600
right so what happened between the Stone

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:26,540
Age and now that enabled this

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,429
proliferation of wealth all the stuff

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,239
that we have now versus the two rock

00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:35,809
tools that we had during the Stone Age

00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:38,649
and Matthew Matt Ridley's contention is

00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:42,379
that what happened is humans began

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:44,329
trading with each other so exchange came

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:49,759
into the picture at the end of the Stone

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:53,739
Age exchange has some interesting sort

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,720
of economic properties and it's it's

00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:58,549
it's kind of interesting at humans are

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,769
the only animal that's ever exhibited

00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:05,360
exchange as a method of interacting

00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,850
somebody I think once said something

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,049
about you've never seen a dog trade

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:14,419
bones with another dog right other

00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,459
animals do cooperate they do teach each

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,039
other things so they teach skills to

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:22,519
each other but they don't actually build

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:26,689
things and trade them and what humans

00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:29,840
found at some point was that exchanging

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:34,460
items was beneficial economically to

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,370
both parties so even if Robin back there

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,620
and I can make two different things

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,200
our selves and she can make both of them

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:46,460
faster than I can if we split the work

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:50,330
up properly we'll both do less work and

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,750
end up with the same stuff and as that

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,860
sort of economic idea took off and it

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,930
didn't take off because somebody

00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,559
understood it it happened probably for

00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:02,420
other reasons we started generating of

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:08,660
that vast amount of wealth compared to

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:10,130
what existed in the world before it one

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,429
of the side effects of it however is

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,960
that people specialized in what they do

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:18,580
so rather than being a jack of all

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,280
trades in your you know like cave pad

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,770
you became someone who knew how to do

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,559
this thing really well because that's

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,840
what you did and then you exchanged the

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:34,160
product of that for all the other things

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,970
you wanted so people became kind of very

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:43,220
focused in their knowledge and that

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:46,160
leads to disperse knowledge across the

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,130
community so it's no longer sort of

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,920
driven by super smart people who have

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,080
aha moments and this you know have some

00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,400
brilliant innovation that pops out of

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,809
their head what instead is happening is

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,690
lots and lots of people in the community

00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:05,240
have little bits of knowledge and

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,610
somehow something happens that causes

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,910
that knowledge to coalesce into new

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,980
things and that process is what Matt

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,700
Matt Ridley is talking about when he

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,850
talks about ideas having sex so you get

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,390
you get this giant pool of information

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,660
and you just let it sort of swish around

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:30,559
together and people will find new ways

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:34,210
to put things together out of that sea

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,210
of seemingly unrelated stuff

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:45,240
so for sort of the big picture here from

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,630
my perspective the key thing that we

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:53,430
need to have innovation or new products

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:55,050
popping out of this what chaos is for

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,910
people to have sufficient Liberty to

00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:03,660
pursue whatever it is they want to

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:05,550
pursue if you're involved somehow at

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,050
some level of government or some

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:12,000
organizational structure where you have

00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:17,640
the ability to organize and regulate the

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,350
activities of other people if maximizing

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,000
the kind of you know availability of

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,160
pencils and all other kinds of cool

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,520
stuff that we have is important to you

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:33,530
you should keep this in mind the

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,780
community needs to be open in a sense of

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:39,540
when exchange is the underlying basis of

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,800
the knowledge the community sort of open

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:46,560
by default because by doing the exchange

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,480
of goods and services knowledge

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,860
transfers from one place to another

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,090
about those goods and services in other

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,220
in other parts of of culture it just

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,070
needs to be open so that the information

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:09,030
that people can use to create new things

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:11,450
can be shared and you know that if we

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,740
can't make a pencil today by yourself

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,750
then it's pretty clear we need to

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:22,440
cooperate with other people to get much

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:27,770
of anything useful done so not hoarding

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,770
knowledge is critical to this working

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,050
chaos is a word i don't really like

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,250
because i don't really think chaos is

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:38,680
involved in what's going on here what we

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,540
have is unregulated human action that is

00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,210
people are doing things based on their

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,640
own interests and goals and desires and

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,670
that unregulated human action isn't

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,560
isn't really chaos but it looks like it

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,630
if you're not involved in it so if

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,040
you're looking at it from the outside it

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,050
just looks like a bunch of people

00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,190
running every direction doing whatever

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:03,910
it is they please and I often hear at

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,430
about this point I often hear people ask

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,350
you know well it sounds like what you're

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,080
suggesting is we just let people run

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,540
amok and do whatever the heck it as they

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,820
want to do and then out of that pops

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:23,230
cool stuff and that is kind of what I'm

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,420
saying but but I'd like to put it in a

00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:29,290
little bit different perspective rather

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,910
than out of chaos the chaos isn't really

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,420
what's going on what there's an economic

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,940
term called spontaneous order and

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:41,080
spontaneous order is by definition what

00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,000
what comes out of human action and it's

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,880
not what comes out of human design it's

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,680
what comes out of human action and if we

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,930
think about that one of the coolest

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,890
things that's ever happened human beings

00:22:49,930 --> 00:23:00,100
is the development of natural language

00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:06,100
where did that come from human action

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:09,250
right people just do it by interacting

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:12,100
with each other by doing the things they

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:15,700
do they naturally developed some sort of

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,590
way to communicate with each other we've

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,120
tried I mean there's no board of

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,030
directors that said this is the language

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,340
this is how it's going to work we have

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,520
some special languages like programming

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,070
languages that aren't natural we don't

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,680
usually communicate we sometimes do

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,410
communicate that way but most people

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,750
don't there are some artificial

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,850
languages that humans have tried to

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,740
create to replace natural languages

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,740
those have been failures

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,950
so it's not out of chaos but it's out of

00:23:50,500 --> 00:24:02,320
unregulated human action that things

00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:04,420
like the pencil pop up so things I'd

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,150
like to encourage and this is a little

00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:10,480
bit thinking about the consequences of

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,000
these things in terms of governance

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,890
bodies and by governance bodies here I

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,410
don't necessarily mean open source

00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:21,910
project government governs bodies could

00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:24,309
be you know your actual governments at

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,210
various levels it could be other sorts

00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:31,450
of institutions or organizations you

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,679
you're involved in but one of the things

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,679
I think we should continue to encourage

00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,240
is just for what what I'm calling

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,220
contributors here and that sounds a

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,559
little bit open source project dish but

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,700
it's I don't really mean it that way

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,620
anybody who's contributing to whatever

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,540
sort of organization or society we want

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,700
to continue to encourage them to scratch

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:56,880
their own inches because that's really

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:58,750
where innovation and stuff comes from

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,460
contributors don't have to be

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,080
individuals a lot of what I've been

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,910
talking about makes it sound like I'm

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,070
only talking about single humans at a

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:12,270
time but it doesn't have to be that a

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:15,460
corporation or a philanthropic

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:19,450
organization those things have their own

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:21,460
itches to scratch too they sort of as a

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,980
group decide what those itches are and

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,140
then they pursue whatever they think is

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,540
you know appropriate to know to

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,290
facilitate achieving whatever goals they

00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:34,000
have so those are contributors also and

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,730
they should be allowed to scratch their

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,630
own niches in as unfettered ways as

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:48,190
possible encourage toleration of

00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:50,679
difficult contributors this one is in a

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,310
way pretty sort of open source community

00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,890
ish because

00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,800
is when we think about the community

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,420
that creates the pencil it doesn't

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,590
interact in a way I'm even though we

00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,540
have like little blocks of animosity

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,790
between groups of people that are

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,010
involved in producing the pencil they

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,840
don't actually have direct communication

00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,980
with each other they're probably not

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,050
even aware that they're both

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,080
contributing to the existence of the

00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:21,050
pencil so they don't really cause

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,660
problems in the development of pencils

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,610
in other sorts of communities and it's

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,830
not just open source communities but any

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,590
communities that have sort of direct

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,740
online communication with a broad group

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:38,180
of contributors we do run into problems

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:40,550
with difficult contributors and being as

00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:44,570
polite as I can about what what is a

00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:48,980
difficult contributor the typical

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:51,050
response i see from organizations is try

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,680
to get them to change which almost never

00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:58,310
happens and when that doesn't happen try

00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,910
to get them to go away and from my

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,010
perspective those aren't really it's

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,070
fine to try to get them to change I have

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:10,040
no objection to that some some people

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:12,650
will come around trying to get them to

00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,440
go away I have a problem with because if

00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,120
they really are contributors they're

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,480
actually helping us achieve the goals

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,310
that we want to achieve and I'd like to

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,050
find a solution to deal with the

00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:28,160
problems that they cause that doesn't

00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:29,870
involve asking them to go away and so

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,360
what instead I would like to do is ask

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,810
the people who aren't difficult

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,370
contributors to be the ones to take care

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:42,230
of the problem and if you I'm sure all

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,660
of you are members of online communities

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,420
all of you have probably seen ridiculous

00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,860
threads pop-up and forums or on mailing

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,270
lists where people just go on and on on

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:58,809
attacking each other and it gets very

00:27:53,270 --> 00:28:00,759
unpleasant almost always there are a few

00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,409
sort of instigators they seem to be

00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,289
instigators they're the ones that are

00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:07,480
always involved in these things but

00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:09,279
there's also a bunch of people that are

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,190
involved in every one of these threads

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,710
that I've seen who aren't you know

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,899
viewed as difficult contributors they're

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,240
offended by what the first person said

00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:21,720
and they want to react to it they feel

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,419
they just need to react to it because

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,830
that person did something bad and you

00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,289
know you don't want to endorse it and

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:33,039
sitting by silently can be thought of as

00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:36,190
endorsing it but I think that's what

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:40,330
they should do you can privately talk to

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:42,940
the person but the non difficult members

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,759
of your community should basically

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,149
ignore the difficult member when he says

00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:51,999
something really nasty and he won't

00:28:49,149 --> 00:29:00,039
continue for hundreds of posts if nobody

00:28:51,999 --> 00:29:03,669
responds doing the next two points I'm

00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,610
going to have a couple of slides each to

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:08,129
describe my thinking about those

00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,610
resource allocation is a hard problem

00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:13,690
it's always going to be a hard problem

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:18,249
so I want to talk about that a little

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:20,470
bit and I'm going to side with not

00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:25,960
pretending that I know how best allocate

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:28,330
resources so so I'm going to encourage

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,279
making resources available even in cases

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:34,119
where you think it might not be the best

00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:37,210
use of resources and then often what

00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:41,080
comes up is and this is a fair sort of

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:44,169
question some people I want to encourage

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,549
people to follow their own ideas so I

00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,230
want them to scratch their own inches

00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:50,259
that means they have ideas they want to

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,940
try them out and I want to encourage

00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:53,799
them to do that I want to make it

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,230
available for them to do make resources

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,330
available for them to do that and I know

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:02,850
a lot of those ideas aren't going to pan

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:05,320
out right then and I know that a

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:08,799
complaint that I hear occasionally and

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,509
it's fair complaint is that this person

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,250
has an idea he wants to try something

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,830
but he can't

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,720
do it all by himself so he asked to ask

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,050
this person for a little tiny bit of

00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,970
help and that person helps and then

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,480
doesn't see any result because whatever

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:26,160
this person was trying doesn't pan out

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,930
and then another person comes along and

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,730
wants to try something else and also

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,250
needs this person's help just a little

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,670
bit of it but over time this sort of

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,230
accumulates and this person is feeling

00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,780
you know burdened by all the people

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,640
asking for a little bit of help and then

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,280
they don't see this person over here

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,430
doesn't see anything positive coming

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,310
from any of this so they get tired of

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:53,880
that and they say well these people just

00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:55,950
have bad ideas and we shouldn't be you

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,830
know like expending resources and time

00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,660
and energy helping them with their bad

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:04,350
idea is we should just tell them those

00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:12,900
ideas are bad do something else so I

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:17,010
want to talk a little bit about that so

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:18,750
what do we do with resources well

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,910
everybody who's ever had any sort of

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,830
control over any resources knows that

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,150
there are times when somebody has to

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,600
decide and if you're the one with

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:29,490
control it's going to be you how to how

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,010
to make use of resources so if we have a

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,460
resource we have five units of this

00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,470
resource this person wants to use those

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,030
five units for one thing another person

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,490
wants to use those five units for

00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,890
something else we can't let both of them

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,080
do it so we have to somebody asked to

00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,330
make a decision and I'm not really

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,010
interested so much in that case because

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,580
in that case you just have to make a

00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:55,200
decision I am good i will say i think

00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:01,590
whatever decision you make will be wrong

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:04,620
so just it's not your fault but i'll

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:08,340
explain that a little bit so in a lot of

00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:10,890
cases though humans at least a lot of

00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,190
humans have a tendency that's probably

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:17,460
learned to conserve resources that they

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:19,950
have so you don't want to you know end

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,410
up without being able to feed yourself

00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,300
so you save for a rainy day and all of

00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,790
all of that gets in green

00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,220
into a lot of us so even when we have a

00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:33,090
lot of a resource or we have a renewable

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,070
resource or we have a resource that for

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,070
a lot of you know purposes can be

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:41,090
thought of as being unlimited we still

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,830
tend to try to hoard it a little bit and

00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:47,040
if we think somebody wants to use it for

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:49,140
some ridiculous thing we think well

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,760
maybe a couple years from now something

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,430
much more important will come along that

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:57,390
will need this so let's just save it and

00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:59,280
tell this person now so I asked the

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,370
question what happens when the wrong

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,780
people decide how to use resources the

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,650
answer to that's going to come in the

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:10,710
next two slides I'll just say that I

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:14,040
think no matter what group decides it's

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:19,260
the wrong group of people and if you

00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:23,010
think about who knows what in this world

00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,670
at this point there isn't any group of

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,430
ten people that has sufficient knowledge

00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,830
about whatever it is they're doing to

00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,900
actually make these kinds of decisions

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:36,900
intelligently I mean they'll do the best

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,150
they can but the small fraction of

00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,640
knowledge they have about what the

00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,790
actual processes are what the potential

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,890
benefits are is so small that there's

00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:51,270
really not much hope for good decision

00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:54,470
making in this area so I want to go back

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:58,260
to the Borrowdale mine for a minute now

00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:06,060
remember this was 500 years ago roughly

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:11,030
and I'm also going to talk about this is

00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:14,250
a model of one of the typical GPS

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,380
satellite servers so we have I think I

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,940
don't remember do we have 24 of those

00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,850
floating around the world something like

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,550
that these two things have something in

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:26,669
common even though they happened 500

00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:28,830
years apart and one thing that we learn

00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:31,169
from this is that we don't usually learn

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,900
things some things we just keep doing

00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:35,170
over and over and over now let's go back

00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:39,410
to borrow down

00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:43,100
so people found this incredible robust

00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:45,140
mine of graphite and it doesn't take

00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,270
long for people to find new ways to use

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:51,910
this kind of stuff right we have a new

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,910
raw material how can we put it to use

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,410
graphite is kind of like the highest

00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,690
grade of coal there is so you could

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,990
imagine it probably has lots of uses

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,270
today even then it wasn't they didn't

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:09,410
like find this and say AHA will make

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:11,720
pencils what they what they discovered

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:15,140
very quickly was that they could improve

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,770
their cannon balls by lining the mold

00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:22,390
for the Cannonball with graphite and

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:25,880
once that was discovered the crown

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,980
decided to put armed guards at this mine

00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,390
so that other people couldn't take the

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,100
graphite and use it for some other

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:35,240
reason and later on when they thought

00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,940
well there's going to be a period of

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,920
time here where we don't need more

00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,570
graphite but we don't want people using

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,960
it we don't want to have armed guards

00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:47,300
you know watching it all the time they

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,260
just flooded the mine so people couldn't

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,720
get in and get the graphite some decades

00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:57,170
went by where people who really wanted

00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,150
to graphite for things like pencils went

00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,890
ahead and found ingenious ways to steal

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:04,160
it from the line despite the armed

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:07,480
guards and the flooding but for I think

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,120
well you know I don't know 4050 years

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:14,600
this resource was sort of prohibited

00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:18,500
from civilian use as best as they could

00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:22,300
at the time and we fast forward five

00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:28,670
hundred years and i'm going to give you

00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:30,710
my history of satellite gps stuff it may

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:34,130
be slightly off from the truth right I'm

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:38,530
not a historian but the way I understand

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:41,540
this happened is in the mid to late 50s

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:45,380
Sputnik was launched and when Sputnik

00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:48,410
sent back radio signals to earth

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:51,050
and a couple of ingenious characters at

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:55,640
Johns Hopkins I think it was Johns

00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:57,980
Hopkins ask themselves question can we

00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,610
use these radio signal somehow to figure

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:05,030
out where Sputnik is in space and so

00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,670
what they did was they concocted some

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:10,520
crazy-looking mathematical formulas and

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,220
they took radio signals and the Doppler

00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,700
effect and combined them and were able

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:20,180
to pinpoint where Sputnik was from

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:24,740
snooping on the radio signals they

00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:28,430
published this right good open knowledge

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,320
people that they were and somebody else

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,810
with knowledge of another sort of

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,550
program that maybe wasn't widely known

00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:41,510
at the time notice this result and was

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:44,620
interested in it so in this case the US

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:48,050
government was working on

00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,970
submarine-launched missiles and while

00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,830
they were working on that they had a

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,290
problem they knew they had a problem and

00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:56,300
the problem was if a submarine goes out

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,850
and sells around the ocean for a couple

00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,130
of months it's hard for it to launch a

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,290
missile directed at something when it no

00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,270
longer knows where it is I mean it

00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,010
doesn't know where it is it knows where

00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,740
the target is but it doesn't know where

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,700
it's launching from so that was a

00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,740
problem that needed to be solved and

00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:18,620
yeah somebody noticed that this Sputnik

00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:22,130
research might be related to that

00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:24,530
problem so they asked these guys if they

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,780
could look at the reverse problem could

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,290
we from space pinpoint where something

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,510
was on earth and of course the interest

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,190
in doing that was they wanted to know

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,770
where the submarines were so they could

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:44,360
launch much more accurate missile

00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:46,940
strikes 30 years went by these these

00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,220
researchers got hired into the program

00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:52,070
to do the research that led to all of

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,970
this and over about the next 30 years

00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:58,190
this technology which we now know is

00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:02,360
immensely useful to humans and general

00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:05,480
was unavailable for civilian use so it

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,970
was hoarded by another government I

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,050
think in the well I know in the early

00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:15,710
80s the then president of the United

00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:20,060
States declared this technology a public

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:23,150
good and over the next decade or so it

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:27,800
was made available for civilian use and

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:30,650
commercial use that was I think fully

00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,230
implemented in 1994 so we've had less

00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,410
than 20 years since it was made

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,150
available to the public and you can

00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:42,080
probably at least people who are older

00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:45,080
than 20 years old can think of all sorts

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:49,160
of amazing uses that this is being put

00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:52,030
to now so finding starbucks by touching

00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:59,180
your phone a few times was not possible

00:39:52,030 --> 00:40:02,360
in 1990 having your car talked to you

00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:04,340
and tell you where to turn next to get

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,690
to this conference hotel was was not

00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:11,240
possible done either so what went wrong

00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:15,260
here in both of these cases 500 years

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:18,460
apart we have governments that hoarded

00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,500
resources that were actually very useful

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:25,120
useful in many many different products

00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,560
and services that people like to consume

00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,010
and what happened is I'm not going to

00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,380
question the motivation of either of

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,530
these governments they were acting on

00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,940
what the knowledge that they had to make

00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,400
the best decision they thought they

00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,670
could about what to do with the resource

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,040
they controlled but the end result is

00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:48,020
the same over and over and over through

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,830
history when this kind of hoarding takes

00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:54,230
place so small small groups of people at

00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:56,540
least since the Stone Age have such

00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,600
imperfect knowledge about what something

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,000
is useful for that they really can't

00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,540
make intelligent decisions about what to

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,540
do with it

00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:16,239
last last thing I want to talk about as

00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:18,430
good ideas and bad ideas I often I often

00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:22,960
hear that especially from people who get

00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:24,910
imposed on by other people's ideas that

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,650
we want to promote only the good ideas

00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:32,380
and problem is yeah how do you decide

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:35,309
what's ahead of time I mean it told okay

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,779
some ideas seem flaky on the surface but

00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:40,089
you don't really know if an idea is good

00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:44,499
or bad until you try it and good and bad

00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:46,329
is a relative judgment thing so I think

00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:50,229
when people say bad what they normally

00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:53,170
mean is an idea is ineffective right it

00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:56,079
doesn't accomplish something now lots of

00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:01,509
ideas however accomplish things later in

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:04,210
life right so they sit around in the pot

00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:06,819
of ideas that Matt Ridley says have sex

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,559
periodically through history and they

00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:10,569
said around in there and eventually they

00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,920
connect up with other things that lead

00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:16,869
to good mutations so here's an example

00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,329
of something that probably most people

00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:21,130
would think was a bad idea I mean you

00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:24,059
need to know when it happened but this

00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:28,269
is like an attempt at a flying machine

00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:31,239
modeled after bat and we've probably

00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:34,650
seen shows on the Discovery Channel and

00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:37,719
whatnot now where we know enough about

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:40,559
the mechanics bat wings that this is

00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:43,719
pretty ludicrous thing to try to do and

00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:47,229
even if you didn't know that stuff it

00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:49,989
looks kind of crazy but if you saw it

00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:52,539
attempt to fly which would take about

00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:56,829
three seconds see it go up about a foot

00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:58,359
and then crash in an ugly fashion you

00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:02,440
would probably conclude it's a bad idea

00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:05,739
also probably everybody here has seen

00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:10,059
pictures of guys from like I don't know

00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:13,210
the 1800s late 1800s Early 1900s with

00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:15,849
like feathers duct tape to their arms

00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,200
and they're like running off the top of

00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,359
a building

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,849
or the edge of a cliff and you know it

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:30,579
just has bad idea written all over it

00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:33,970
right but then there was this idea which

00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:36,520
changed the world and how is it

00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:39,460
different from those bad ideas we just

00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,130
talked about it worked that's the only

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,790
difference right it was the same idea

00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:47,220
humans flying this one worked it changed

00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,990
the world we think it was a great idea

00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,540
the other ones didn't work we condemn

00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:54,070
them as bad ideas what we don't know is

00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,980
whether this one would have happened

00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:59,589
without the hundreds or thousands of

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:03,190
ridiculous attempts at flight that

00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:06,910
preceded it all that failed stuff going

00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:09,579
into the pots dude around with you know

00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,380
this obviously has new technology that

00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:15,579
wasn't available when those earlier

00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:18,160
attempts happened and so that we have a

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:20,320
new mixture and the mixture includes

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,290
both good and bad things information

00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,329
that comes from good and bad things or i

00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,980
should say good and ineffective things i

00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:30,010
think the guy with the feathers duct

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,599
taped to his arm had a good idea it just

00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,599
wasn't the way the way to implement it

00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:42,670
so I'm kind of of the opinion that I

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,030
will agree that I do think there are

00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,280
some bad ideas the bad ideas from my

00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,290
perspective and this is a value again

00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,230
like I said it's a value judgment what

00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:56,910
makes an idea bad I think bad ideas are

00:44:53,230 --> 00:45:01,619
the ones that are designed to impede

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,940
people pursuing their own goals so

00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:08,430
government and organization structures

00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:11,380
that are designed to do the opposite of

00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:13,960
provide you Liberty to pursue your own

00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:19,109
goals our ideas that i think are bad

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:21,329
ideas that are not in that realm now

00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:24,690
I think are really mostly just

00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:27,869
ineffective or effective there we call

00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:30,390
that good or bad now could we skip and

00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:32,099
do we want to not spend resources on the

00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:36,119
ones that were pretty sure going to fail

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:37,950
to start with well you might need to do

00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,859
that if you have resource restrictions

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:43,859
but in general I think it's better to

00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:46,079
have more stuff in the idea pot more

00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:49,049
experience with trying it this way and

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,099
that way even if those ways fail they

00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:54,839
make subsequent technology games easier

00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:57,299
because if you didn't try it the wrong

00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:00,739
way somebody else is likely to come

00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:00,739
along later and try it the wrong way

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:13,700
so back to this quote the lack of wonder

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:16,849
here's where I think that comes from I

00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:23,059
think it's been around for quite a long

00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:25,759
time I've mentioned several times that

00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:28,519
we've as we left the stone age and

00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:33,170
developed until now having an exchange

00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:36,920
based economic system or doesn't even

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:39,980
have to be an economic system but living

00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,920
by exchanging things has led to people

00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,519
specializing the knowledge that they

00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,380
have is specialized compartmentalised

00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,960
that's resulted in us not understanding

00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,700
the things around us so if we don't

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,710
understand the things around us I don't

00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,839
know how my microwave oven works i don't

00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,089
know I'm like I know what my cars for

00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,710
right I can drive it but I don't know

00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:03,650
how it works I don't know how to build

00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,059
one the same thing is true with my

00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,799
microwave oven and I know what it's

00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:10,960
supposed to do I know how to put food in

00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:10,960
it punch a few buttons and get it nuked

00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:16,730
but I'm getting things that I can't

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,710
think about I can't really spend my time

00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,989
thinking about how they work because

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,390
it's just not I know I can't understand

00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:24,950
how they work I don't know I can't

00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,249
understand how they're made I can't

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,309
understand you know the only thing I can

00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:34,099
understand is what their purpose is and

00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:37,039
what I have to do to make that happen

00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,329
which usually isn't very much when i get

00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,289
this pencil it doesn't come with a

00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:43,640
schematic or instructions right I have

00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,309
to figure out how to sharpen the end of

00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,829
it once I've once I've mastered that

00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:50,359
right it just pretty much is obvious how

00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:52,880
to use it and the same thing is true

00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:56,619
with microwaves and cars you have to

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,869
learn a little bit and then then you go

00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:02,690
so the fact that we don't know how

00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:05,119
anything around us comes to be or works

00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:09,789
anymore I think is one of the reasons

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,789
that we're lacking and wonder

00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:19,670
so I hope thanks for coming and I'd like

00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:26,119
to thank self for inviting me back are

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:28,779
there any questions pencils should

00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,779
generate questions

00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:53,590
okay well thanks thanks for coming how's

00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:57,280
that sigh every way this is the way to

00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:59,230
better utilize all your resources and it

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,290
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:07,150
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:10,480
in open source the collaborative nature

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:13,180
and of the you know of the community and

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,220
the speed at which these are these you

00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,380
know these deficiencies these bugs are

00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,140
getting discovered and then fixed is it

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:23,140
like that really shows the power of the

00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,760
of the open source community it is

00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:28,960
global and it's definitely because of

00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:35,290
the users community people are extremely

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:37,180
friendly and almost ready to help if you

00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:39,490
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,220
guys helping each other out and they're

00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:43,900
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:46,890
the product is transparent for everyone

00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:50,109
everyone can look at the code base

00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:52,320
everyone can see how CloudStack is being

00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:57,820
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:49:52,320 --> 00:50:00,430
everything is open in many ways it's

00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:04,900
absolutely vital to the the unborn

00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:09,130
health CloudStack the most exciting

00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,840
event in recent memory for he was our

00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:14,600
first developer boot camp

00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,240
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:21,200
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:25,370
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:28,220
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:30,740
chairs in the room twice everything

00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:34,010
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:37,070
is open source and so I don't think that

00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:38,990
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,440
sources not pervasive in cloud computing

00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:44,600
and so i think it's i think it's an

00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,100
assumption i think when you talk about

00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:51,260
cloud computing you're really talking

00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:53,210
about a source cloud computing cloud sac

00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,970
is a robust solution for large

00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:58,370
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:02,330
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:05,660
data center is these hardware is going

00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:08,870
to fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:11,360
handle number one that mass scale number

00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:14,090
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,340
that inevitably happens in large

00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:20,180
deployments we started working on

00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:23,510
contact over four years ago and it was

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:26,180
the original set of people working on it

00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:30,290
had a background of delivering software

00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:34,520
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:38,150
lots of users actually using it high

00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:41,210
availability is the key feature multiple

00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:43,250
hypervisors support different network

00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,920
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:48,170
you better well step management server

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,860
can be deployed in different physical

00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,510
machines it definitely has a huge

00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:58,520
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:51:53,510 --> 00:52:01,100
there's a major movie studio that they

00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,400
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,380
to transcode video and i thought that

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,030
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,300
more fascinating is what they did during

00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:14,060
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,440
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,010
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,130
the instance

00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:21,560
isn't go back to doing real work

00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:23,030
CloudStack is vast it touches so many

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,950
different aspects and there's no one

00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:27,910
person that's kind of like a master of

00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:31,370
all those realms I think CloudStack as a

00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:33,620
project is going to be one of the

00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:37,670
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:43,100
most feature folan and and robust

00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:46,030
platforms out they were Adams senior

00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,030
living for the clouds dag

00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,910
you

00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,279
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,229
ago we could not have imagined that

00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:13,450
asterisk would not only become the most

00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:15,579
widely adopted open source communication

00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,619
software on the planet but that it would

00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:20,140
impact the entire industry in the way

00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:22,119
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,759
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:26,710
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:28,809
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,190
transition of power from the hands of

00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:32,469
the traditional proprietary phone

00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,869
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:36,940
administrators of phone systems using

00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:38,589
this power our customers have traded all

00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,690
sorts of business changing applications

00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:42,489
from small office phone systems to

00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,589
mission-critical call centers the

00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:46,420
international carrier networks in fact

00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:47,859
there's even an entire country those

00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,349
communications infrastructure runs on

00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:52,269
esters the gym has always been about

00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:53,979
creating technology that expands

00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:56,140
communications capabilities in ways that

00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:57,339
we could never have imagined and that's

00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,739
part of what's game-changing about

00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:02,440
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:04,509
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,640
IP phones that extends control of the

00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:08,380
user all the way to the desktop the

00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,119
launch of these new products represents

00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:12,099
the next phase indigenous history of

00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:14,619
innovation these are the first and only

00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:16,329
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,859
power of esters when we first discussed

00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:19,900
our expectations for building a family

00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:22,059
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,799
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,420
the team to build the phones such that

00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:27,640
they were easy to install integrate

00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,469
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,049
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:33,670
that goal user feedback is validating

00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:35,799
that when it comes to operation with

00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:38,200
astro space systems including our own

00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:40,779
switchvox based product these are the

00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,099
easiest to use best integrated most

00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:44,680
interoperable products on the market

00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:46,650
today the Digium family of phones will

00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,729
initially include three IP des hommes

00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,680
uniquely designed to complement any

00:54:48,729 --> 00:54:52,539
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,210
these phones are different for a number

00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:57,849
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,289
designed for use with esters secondly

00:54:57,849 --> 00:55:00,900
we've made it really easy to

00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:03,279
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,349
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:07,329
to access information inside of estrus

00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:08,170
allowing tight coupling between an

00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:10,900
application

00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:13,059
the phone additionally we've created an

00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,190
applications engine that allows users

00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:18,430
and developers to create and run their

00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:20,200
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:22,150
done all of this at a very compelling

00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,829
price point at Digium we're always

00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,930
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:28,450
the best value in business phone systems

00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:30,040
and also give them the power to create

00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,170
their own solutions or any

00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,910
communications challenge well continue

00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,349
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,390
astros cooler bastard more

00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:39,010
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:41,500
asterisk and what communications even

00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:45,180
easier and together we'll change the way

00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,180
the world communication again

00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:56,760
your customers rely on your website or

00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,160
application if it's slower

00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,099
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,900
and costs you money keeping your

00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:07,430
business critical systems humming along

00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:09,740
requires insight into what they're doing

00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:11,690
your system metrics tells stories

00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,700
stories that can reveal performance

00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:16,040
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,599
other problems but how do you keep an

00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,240
eye on all of your systems performance

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,270
metrics in real-time and record this

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,250
data for later analysis enter longview

00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,050
the new way to see what's really going

00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:29,210
on under the hood the long view

00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,280
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:33,740
of all your systems providing you with a

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,099
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,680
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:41,450
load and network usage click a specific

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,849
system to access its individual

00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:46,359
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:48,770
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:50,420
comprehensive network data including

00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,730
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:54,319
available on the network tab and disk

00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:56,240
rights and free space on the disk

00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,059
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,609
displays usage statistics for individual

00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:03,770
processes the system info tab shows

00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:06,020
listening services active connections

00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:08,150
and available updates adding long view

00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,859
to a system is easy just click the

00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,990
button copy the one line installation

00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:14,450
command then run the command on your

00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,130
linux system to complete the process the

00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:18,319
agent will begin collecting data and

00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,829
sending it to longview then the graph

00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:24,079
start rolling use long view to gain

00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:28,839
visibility into your servers so when

00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,839
your website or app heats up it stays up

00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,920
most enterprises today realize that

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,569
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,940
enough to keep their network saved from

00:58:16,569 --> 00:58:21,010
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,050
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:25,180
popular lately that adds that extra

00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:27,849
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:29,619
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:31,810
know is that some two-factor

00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:34,030
authentication solutions they're better

00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:37,060
than others like two-factor strong

00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:39,339
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,290
beyond other authentication systems by

00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:44,349
being less expensive easier to implement

00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:46,839
and easier to use giving software-based

00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:49,720
token clients built to run on all major

00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:52,290
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,640
Android these tokens utilize a

00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:56,859
public/private key combination that's

00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,990
generated and on device so there aren't

00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:01,510
any shared secrets flying around for

00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:04,359
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:06,220
special handling instead all keys are

00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:08,710
kept secure and private between the

00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,900
requesting token and your server which

00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:12,510
you control in house making it the most

00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,190
secure way possible to perform

00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:17,980
authentication encryption and with an

00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:20,770
extensive flexible API and support for
