the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,900
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,099
possible alright so let's go ahead and

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,950
get started this is as you can see from

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,290
the title slide how I learned to really

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,700
love software foundation's this is me

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,309
some people may remember me from such

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,530
projects as tech journalism and the

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,980
opensuse project manager or a community

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,829
manager these days i work for citrix

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,960
full-time right now i'm working on the

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,840
cloud sac project and actually a PMC

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,510
member on CloudStack recovering tech

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,510
journalists if you have any comments or

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,770
thoughts about my talk please feel free

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,780
to tweet me I love when people do the

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,970
social media thing if you have any

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,549
questions or comments after the talk

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,259
that's my email address i usually get

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,850
snarky with people who ask for my email

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,229
address because that indicates you

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,860
probably don't know how to use google

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:26,250
but just jzb of zonker god net will get

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,290
to me or jay-z be at Apache org so as i

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,060
mentioned i used to work on this project

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,740
opensuse how many people have used

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,710
opensuse okay a really good group of

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,619
people that you know kind of originated

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,450
the Susa distribution really fun project

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,470
to work on a lot of people that it

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,229
really liked but i was paid full time to

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,149
work for these folks now novell there

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,340
are also a lot of bright nice people

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,200
that were at Novell when I was there as

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,390
you all know novell really doesn't exist

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,270
anymore they were sold and split up and

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,450
everything but I worked there from 2008

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,110
to 2010 and they hired me because they

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:12,000
wanted to make opensuse a successful

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,730
open source project okay the problem

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,110
being corporations and open

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,760
source don't always mix very well right

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,159
you you spend a lot of time explaining

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,230
what you should do and then people spend

00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,670
a lot of time explaining to you why

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,680
that's not going to happen or why

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,349
they're it conflicts with their business

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,280
interests and things like that how many

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:36,920
people remember I folder only 12 people

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:43,840
I folder was sort of like pre Dropbox

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:46,129
okay and it had i think was under like

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,040
2003-2004 the guys that had come in from

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,690
zim ian when novell bought them were

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,670
like let's make this open-source let's

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,470
let's build a community lets you know do

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,599
this that and there was a lot of

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,010
enthusiasm and people were excited and

00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,379
then it got moved to a different

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,319
business unit and it just died and they

00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:05,829
stopped updating it and you went to them

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,940
and said you really I spent nine months

00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:09,590
lobbying to get them to do the right

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,560
thing to at least communicate to the

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,720
outside world this project no longer

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,549
exists as an open source project and

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,810
they wouldn't it took nine months to get

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:22,819
any movement at all so I learned a lot

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,840
of frustration about corporate open

00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:29,030
source okay so what I'm talking about

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,739
today is open source software

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,000
foundation's now there are many

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,220
different open source software

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,319
foundation's and i'm going to make the

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,000
case why you might consider working

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,859
within one of these if you're not

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,450
already or why you might want to check

00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,519
out projects that are in one of these

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,639
foundations now these are not all alike

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,940
my experience has largely been with

00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,010
Apache ok so what I say today is largely

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,150
applicable to Apache but it also applies

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:58,519
to eclipse and some other ones not every

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,459
project belongs in a foundation if

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,829
you're working on a small project if

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,870
you're working on something that

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:08,480
scratches a very personal itch it may be

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,220
fine on github okay but if you're

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,519
talking about large projects that

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,650
involve 10 20 30 developers or more that

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,150
has a corporate use you may want to

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,530
explore a software foundation how many

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,320
people are working on something like

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,930
that too

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,000
one person nobody else to how many

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,630
people are using software from one of

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,260
these groups okay how many people are in

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,780
a position to contribute a couple more

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,100
all right well hopefully at the end of

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,980
this presentation will be at least

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:43,820
inspired to contribute if not start a

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,320
project so the impetus for this talk

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,870
came from how many people remember

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,120
Apache considered harmful about a year

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,160
and a half ago maybe two years so

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,770
basically somebody would been involved

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,660
with an apache software project got very

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,640
frustrated because they were trying to

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,610
adopt get and some things that Apache

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,140
wasn't initially set up for and they

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,420
basically made the case that you know

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,650
there's github what do you mean why do

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,330
you need more than github you can move

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,260
fast on github you can do great

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,660
development there right and I think

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,850
there is a strong case for open-source

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,270
foundations for a number of reasons far

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,060
beyond just the tools okay reason number

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,610
one a lot of companies find open source

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,910
very scary this is not in fact a

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:31,310
screenshot from The Exorcist this is the

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:36,860
GPL is described by a corporate lawyer

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:38,980
okay a lot of companies are very scared

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,740
of open source they're a lot less so now

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:46,340
but they they need some hand-holding

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,080
they need they need some help okay now

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm not necessarily talking about every

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,250
corporation there are certain

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,410
corporations that get it obviously Red

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,990
Hat you know kind of gets the

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,420
open-source thing there are other

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,050
companies that get it but it's not in

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,970
their DNA in most cases so for a

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,500
corporation or a large organization to

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,420
get involved with open source they need

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,940
a little help and like i said when i was

00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,700
at Novell i experienced a great deal of

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,040
frustration because you spent a lot of

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,890
time telling them what they should do

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,130
what really kind of need is a trainer

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,510
okay you don't need to just get the book

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,870
and know what you should do you need

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,150
somebody telling you you must do that

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,190
okay how many people have just gone out

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,190
and spontaneously lost a bunch of weight

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,040
spontaneously so I mean I've had the

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,240
fortune to work with a personal trainer

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,430
obviously not recently okay but it was

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,780
very helpful having somebody you know

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,180
kind of guiding you through the process

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,730
telling you what you should do getting

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,350
you on a plan and you know you know why

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,030
personal trainers make you pay up front

00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,340
so that you actually show up the first

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:02,560
after the first time so another thing

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,990
that I really like about apache is there

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,490
are rules okay they're actually codified

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,770
practices for working and with an Apache

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,740
project that you don't get when you're

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,290
working in a corporation or if a open

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,150
source project it's freelance okay again

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,670
there's a lot of what we should do this

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,710
or it's a good practice the red hat

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,010
fedora folks what's the guy that you

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,810
guys have Paul I forget it's the open

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,360
sort basically I get a manual for open

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,460
source Carsten working the open-source

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,530
way thank you so there is the

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,320
open-source way Apache actually has a

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,230
site on the Apache way okay the

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,610
difference between saying going your

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,830
manager and saying you should read the

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,660
open-source way and being involved in

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,270
Apache is you basically get to tell your

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,300
manager no we have to do this not we

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,010
should we must another thing I like

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,590
about apache is you have an incubation

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,840
period for projects okay they actually

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,880
have a planned life cycle for projects

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,000
and part of that is taking in a project

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,070
and putting you through the paces to

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,590
become a healthy community not just code

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,590
wise but actually community wise and

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,240
part of that is mentoring okay so you

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,600
actually have people who are going to

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,350
help you work through this process that

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,280
have been through it

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,830
for it's not like everybody I'll use

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,810
cloudstack is an example okay when

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,780
cloudstack was proposed to the incubator

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,210
last year the number of people in citrix

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,880
who had actually worked in a successful

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,860
open source project was a very small

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,180
number but there are a lot of developers

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,090
involved and they needed a little

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,419
assistance in becoming acclimated to

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,190
doing things the open-source way another

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,510
thing that i really like about apache is

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,210
the philosophy of community / code okay

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,760
this is really really important you get

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,980
a lot of developers who are not used to

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,530
open source and they are more concerned

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,170
about getting features in and being

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,060
productive and efficient than actually

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,680
fostering the community that means

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,450
they're more interested in pushing their

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,790
stuff in and getting it merged than

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,980
mentoring new developers or answering

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,830
people's questions or responding to

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,500
people's queries about you know if you

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,150
if you completely redo this if you guys

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,190
come in and refactor this area of the

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,590
code how is that going to impact what I

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,080
want to do in two months okay and

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,180
without some sort of framework when a

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,850
company is left to its own devices to

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,410
push forward on an open source project

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,850
it often does not pay attention to

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,060
community development the way that it

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,560
should another thing they like about

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,310
foundations is they supply

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,860
infrastructure okay Gib is a great tool

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,890
for collaborative software development

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,240
but it is missing some pieces okay how

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,550
many people have gone to look for a

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,470
project that has a github page and the

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:58,600
only information is a is a readme okay

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,550
no documentation just the readme if

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,590
you're if you don't even necessarily

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,480
have a license how many people gone and

00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,600
looked at a github project and found

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,700
there's not even a default license here

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,280
okay when you're working in with within

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,080
a foundation they are going to pretty

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,080
much suggest a license for you you're

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,060
going to know what you're getting into

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,130
another thing that you get you don't

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,700
just go into a pro something like Apache

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:27,520
and basically you know get a month

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,220
kind of title your own way you also get

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,930
mentoring and reporting okay that means

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,620
that you're actually accountable to

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,620
someone incubating projects athlete

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,620
actually have to produce a report and so

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,540
do graduated projects so they are always

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,080
accountable to someone in a way that

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,430
other open source projects are not

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,230
another thing that's really important

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,870
about foundations is membership how many

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,540
people have heard or have experienced

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,250
well let's let's take a step back how

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,850
many folks actually use Lennox on a

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:07,030
regular basis okay how many of you are

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:11,160
familiar with the x window system okay

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:14,080
how many of you are still using X 386

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,420
exactly okay I don't know how many folks

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,300
remember the reason why we're all using

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,040
xorg today but it had a lot to do with

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,840
the fact that developers who wanted to

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,370
get code and wanted to see more

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,780
transparent processes got very

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,010
frustrated with the people who are

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,810
leading the project okay in Apache and

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,170
other foundations there are guidelines

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:37,900
for people getting commit access which

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,090
prevents there from being at least one

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,700
hopes a core team of developers who

00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,600
don't let anyone else in this is one of

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,450
the things that we've been very

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,400
conscious of with CloudStack is watching

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,800
people's contributions and after they've

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,140
made a number of successful good

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,820
contribution saying you know what these

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,530
people need to have the commitment so

00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,420
that a they can be a little more

00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,530
efficient they don't have to be reviewed

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,960
every time they want to put something

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,790
into the code base and be so they feel

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,350
acknowledged and welcome in the

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,610
community that they know that they are

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,200
part of this and they have a stake

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,560
another really important thing about

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,170
apache is that I contribute as myself I

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,900
don't contribute as a employee of citrix

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,820
I don't contribute wearing a corporate

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,150
hat at all I contribute as an individual

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,640
okay and this is very very important

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,040
because it means that you are supposed

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,380
to be doing the best thing

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,190
for the project not necessarily for your

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,519
corporate sponsor I find this extremely

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,019
important I've been kind of going on for

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,730
a few minutes and everybody's been very

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:56,639
quiet sore there any questions or

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:58,949
thoughts so far okay yep so like when we

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,800
do reporting in Apache you're supposed

00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,120
to talk about the community diversity

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,550
any issues that you might have

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,250
encountered what progress you have made

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,040
since the I'm sorry I'll repeat the

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,209
question so the question was what do I

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,889
mean when I talk about accountability

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:18,630
right okay so what they want when they

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,329
look for reporting is first they want to

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,220
know if there any problems so I'll use

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:26,459
CloudStack as an example again we had a

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,660
period of time where we found we were

00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,279
having a little bit of a problem with

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,440
some of the contributions not going

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,690
through the proper process so they

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,760
actually had to be pulled out and go

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,100
through a separate legal review IP

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,620
review okay which was a problem that we

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,360
needed to correct but they're looking

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,889
for things like is everybody doing

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,410
development in the open are you doing

00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:49,079
stuff on the mailing list have you

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,819
gotten any new contributors or new PMC

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,589
members since last month and things like

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,940
that so that's kind of what they're

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:55,230
really looking for and they want it they

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,779
basically want to make sure that you're

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,620
still alive right not every project

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,910
CloudStack has been very very active

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,769
objectively speaking there are other

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,790
incubating projects that only have a

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,380
couple of people who are doing

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,000
development and they want to know is

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,010
this project ever going to successfully

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,269
graduate or is this project just going

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,889
to kind of languish in the incubator

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,600
because at a certain point you need to

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,360
say either it's going to graduate or it

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,290
needs to be you know put me AV at it

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,290
okay

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,120
another thing that Apache is really good

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,750
for and other foundations are good for

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,130
is legal rules and guidance okay one of

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,860
the first things that happened when the

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,430
code was donated to Apache last year was

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,080
we went through a lot file by file to

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,350
make sure that everything was actually

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,240
distributable under Apache rules okay

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,400
and Apache has specific rules about what

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,580
things you can distribute not everything

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,890
in our code the code base code Beast

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,330
code base must be apache license but it

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,870
must be compatible with the apache

00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:01,589
license so MIT and bsd or okay GPL is

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,330
not all right proprietary obviously is

00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,250
not and we had to rejigger some things

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,200
so that we could distribute there but

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,060
there are things also trademark

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,890
guidelines and whatnot so that you

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,690
actually enforce your trademark and they

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,430
make sure that your trademark you're not

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,570
stepping on somebody else before you

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,620
graduate they do some due diligence

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:22,170
there okay one of my favorite rules is

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,900
this it didn't happen on the mailing

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:29,490
list it didn't happen anybody know why

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:33,000
that's really important who said

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:40,620
documentation okay that is one good rule

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,380
but it's not the most important Deb so

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,680
Deb says so you don't replicate that's

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,830
not quite what I'm looking for yeah

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,440
accountability is important transparency

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,360
and to make sure that everybody has to

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,970
say in the community has an opportunity

00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,050
to have a say i should say there are

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,720
projects that have their meetings and

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,640
make decisions on IRC for example

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,050
there's a problem there we have

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,730
contributors in europe we have

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,860
contributors on both coasts the united

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,500
states we have contributors in middle

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,450
united states we have folks in india and

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,080
i think a couple one or two people in

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,250
Australia getting all of those folks in

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,279
conversation in real time is really

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,529
really hard ok and that means inevitably

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,110
if we do things in real time if we do

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,200
them on IRC or chat or some

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,880
like that people get left out if five

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,500
guys get together at a conference and

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,050
have a hack trust and decide we're going

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,260
to refactor storage somebody's going to

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,610
get left out okay so you need to do it

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,500
on the mailing list and you have a wait

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,660
period before major decisions are made

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:49,790
and if you can't reach consensus you

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:52,519
have a vote okay another thing that I

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,560
really like about apache is they're

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,779
concerned about the entire life cycle of

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,370
a project how many people have gone to

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,019
look for something you've heard about a

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,880
really neat open source project and you

00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:06,410
go we haven't had an update since like

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,530
1999-2000 five some ridiculous amount of

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,959
time right at a certain point if an

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,120
Apache project is not being updated if

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,459
it's not being taken care of they'll put

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,799
it in the Attic okay that's just as

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:24,260
important to me as the beginning part of

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,600
the life cycle so what's the experience

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,309
like when you actually go new into

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,570
patchy when you're a corporation you

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:35,299
donate something to Apache it's sort of

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,150
like the five stages of grief for a lot

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:41,809
of folks in the organization first

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:44,090
there's denial okay a lot of people just

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,710
don't realize that their job is in fact

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,030
going to change as a developer that

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,200
they're actually going to have to do

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:54,650
things a different way and largely they

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,990
don't and they get called on it which

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,460
again I think is great because you

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,080
actually have a structure that allows

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,840
you to go to your manager or somebody

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,190
else's manager and say you can't do that

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,929
it's not me it's Apache okay it's really

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,860
hard to argue that when you're standing

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:15,710
alone all right the next stage for a lot

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,240
of folks is anger you know when you tell

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,890
the developer who's always been able to

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,100
push things into core that they have to

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,510
wait 72 hours to make a major merge you

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,950
usually find a little bit of an

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,220
at that you usually get a lot of

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,080
frustration okay developers are good at

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,490
a great many things that being told no

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,410
is not always one of them okay so after

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,760
you go through that stage usually the

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,060
next thing that you hit is bargaining

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,400
well can we bend this rule for this can

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,100
we do this differently just in this case

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:50,840
and the answer is usually no no you

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:54,800
cannot and after you go through that for

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,660
a while you get depression people are a

00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,520
little demoralized for a while they're a

00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,670
little bummed out that they can't it's

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,320
not the way things have always been

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,980
luckily this phase usually doesn't last

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,510
too terribly long some people that last

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,030
longer than others but for the most part

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,000
it's it's sort of a trough you get

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:16,310
through the other side and finally you

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,680
you keep working you work the process

00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:22,850
and finally you get to acceptance and

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,800
everyone is happy okay now I don't want

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,110
to oversell it I don't want to claim

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,820
that foundations or the silver bullet or

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,160
the magic fairy dust there in a rescue

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:35,630
every single open source project at a

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:38,840
corporation or a group wants to you know

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,440
make successful it's not as awesome as a

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,120
kitten writing a unicorn over a rainbow

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,400
but it is pretty good there are problems

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,800
and I want to be honest about some of

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,780
the problems one is infrastructure now

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,390
as I said Apache provides infrastructure

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,420
and demands as a matter of fact that you

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,990
have certain infrastructure on the other

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:03,230
hand Apache what Apache giveth it

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,930
doesn't always give us quickly it can

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,760
take weeks sometimes months to get

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:11,300
things provision which can be very very

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,150
inconvenient not that that is unique to

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:19,629
software foundation's this happens in

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:22,489
corporations as well you can have

00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:24,259
the downside to everything must have

00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:26,539
consensus is reaching consensus

00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,279
occasionally can be a little laborious

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,519
and certainly more so than when you do

00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:35,629
it and you can just have a BD FL that

00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:37,460
says it will be this way right there are

00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:42,649
other problems as well David anything to

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:45,769
add in this particular section no okay

00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:58,450
is that a lack of things to talk about

00:20:45,769 --> 00:21:03,200
or simply an unwillingness okay yeah

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:05,899
okay I have really powered through these

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,869
a lot faster than I expected that is

00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:11,230
actually what I have got so now I will

00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:14,379
take any questions that you might have

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,379
yes sir

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,830
it varies a lot so for example let's

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,990
take the Linux Foundation in Eclipse I

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,140
think Eclipse process is very similar to

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:39,120
Apache so basically you go and you say

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,660
we have this project we have a code base

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,580
and we have you know this number of

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:49,170
people who are ready to form a project

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,630
then Linux Foundation is a little more

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,460
corporate and it's a little more you

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,610
kind of go to their board and you it's

00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,620
al it's a less transparent process you

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,180
would go to their board and you say you

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,560
know we have this saying like the Zen

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,280
stuff that they wanted to put under

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,740
Linux Foundation and there's discussions

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,540
and however they do that but I don't

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,740
think that's it's nowhere near as

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,600
transparent or as simple as Apache then

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,180
you have like the software freedom

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,610
Conservancy run by Bradley Kuhn and some

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,440
other folks their process is a little

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,970
bit different I think you go to Bradley

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,510
and their board and you say we'd like to

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,970
get this in and their main constraint is

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,470
actually the number of people because

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,330
they provide different services they

00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,210
don't they don't do mentoring the way

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,680
they do or they don't be mentoring the

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,890
way we do but they do provide legal

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,530
services and some other an umbrella 401

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:46,220
C and things like that so their intake

00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:49,740
process is different and there is no

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:52,170
mentoring there is no incubation period

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,570
things like that the one regret that I

00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,350
have about software foundation's when I

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,350
was researching this is that there is no

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:04,740
that I know of there is no Apache like

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:08,220
organization for copyleft projects okay

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:11,460
so eclipse and apache are obviously very

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,990
corporate friendly licenses but i don't

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,800
know of an organization that actually

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,990
provides mentoring and incubation for a

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,180
software project that is copyleft

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:24,090
friendly which i think is actually a

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,760
shame because i would like to see more

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,370
adoption of those licenses I'm fine with

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,050
Apache

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,300
no complaints about that as a license

00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:34,390
and I know a lot of businesses are much

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,730
happier with that license but at the

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,280
same time I think there there's a lot of

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:42,790
room for mentoring for GPL projects and

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:48,280
stuff that doesn't it doesn't happen any

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:52,059
other question so question is what about

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:56,970
the SF SF no I mean they really don't

00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,970
provide the same kind of services Deb

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:38,070
you know and then begin to it then it

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:41,150
don't roll your own relationship that

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:44,610
they have is still not the same type of

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:48,150
relationship intra with patchy but it

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:50,790
isn't always full disclosure with media

00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:56,030
about one and we got this property

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:56,030
campaign for us continuing with other

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,910
you go and the other thing I would add

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,380
to that everybody laughed when she said

00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:07,310
make sure the code compiles that's not

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:23,840
actually trivial so any other questions

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:25,400
or comments yes so the question is what

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,940
happened to projects that don't

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,200
incubator don't make it that don't okay

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,760
so the question is what happens to

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,410
projects that don't graduate not really

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,660
aware of many I think most ones that

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:43,790
haven't graduated weren't kicked out

00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:47,830
they simply just sort of you know well

00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,830
no they actually get retired

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:14,010
but I'm not now David you may know of

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,890
one but I don't know of anybody who's

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:19,140
ever been you know basically shown the

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,210
door like I think it's more of a we

00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,400
don't have the momentum to graduate not

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:49,430
you guys just aren't getting your stuff

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:49,430
together yeah yeah yes

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:10,020
and what the vetting process is there if

00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,020
these projects you have any relevance to

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,470
ok so that was several questions i'm

00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,910
gonna try to send that up and then I'll

00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,520
answer your question so the question is

00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,350
basically what are the criteria for a

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,630
project to get into the incubator and

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:28,270
are there any fees involved those are so

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:32,140
there are not there are some set

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:35,290
criteria the bar is it's about this high

00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:38,230
I would not say it's like this high the

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,730
bar is definitely there to ensure that

00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,040
they don't waste their time setting up

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,080
infrastructure for a project that has no

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,520
hope of graduation you have us you have

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,390
to have mentors you have to have a

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,310
champion you have to have a proposal

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,350
there will be discussion on the

00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:56,400
incubator mailing lists a general

00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:59,260
mailing list that is centered around ok

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,880
what problem do you solve that isn't

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,970
already being solved by another open

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,070
source project do you have the diversity

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:10,060
or do you have a plan to create

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:12,610
diversity so like when Citrix came to

00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,230
patching with CloudStack obviously it

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,560
didn't have a great deal of diversity at

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:19,030
the moment but they you know brought in

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,860
some people that were customers that

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,470
wanted to contribute and they basically

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:27,730
showed we have a plan to create that

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:29,050
kind of diversity and so basically any

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,820
project that is accepted in the

00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,310
incubator will be vetted and discussed

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,170
and you know that's kind of an

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,930
opportunity I've seen one project

00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,310
recently for example after about a day's

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,840
discussion of them what makes your

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:43,750
project different from this and this and

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,060
this and they didn't have satisfactory

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,230
answers they basically said thank you

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,200
you've giving me stuff to think about

00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:52,840
and I'll come back and so that's it

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,900
that's it that's a good result as far as

00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,740
fees there are no fees so if you have

00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,900
five ten people

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,250
who are completely dirt poor but have an

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,920
open source project they want to get

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,260
into Apache that is that should not be a

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,020
barrier okay as long as they have

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:17,950
computers that would be good but now no

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:17,950
fees yeah any other questions yes sir

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,040
so the question is you know mainly

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,020
talked about software foundation's and

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,230
things like github and there are

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:58,320
alternatives to those certainly and so

00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:01,440
I'll talk about that for a minute there

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,750
are a couple of options one is you don't

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,850
have the foundation of any sort you have

00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,620
a group of people who run a project and

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,630
somebody owns the domain and somebody

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,850
owns it maybe owns the trademark or

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,470
maybe doesn't somebody pays the hosting

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,200
bill maybe raise money maybe you don't

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:20,280
and that can continue indefinitely and

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,770
be lovely or you can run into problems

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,240
where somebody decides that domain is

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,710
suddenly valuable and I'd like to

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
exploit it commercially and guess what

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,280
it's in my name and we have seen that

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,600
right it's it's rare but it does happen

00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,700
it's sort of like going into business

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,890
with friends I don't recommend it unless

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,110
it's a very very small project with

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,720
almost zero commercial interest the

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,850
other way is for projects that are big

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,160
enough or want to be big enough and

00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,370
actually invest the money in creating a

00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:53,100
foundation specifically for that project

00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:56,310
that is an option and sometimes it works

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,130
out very well but it is a lot of work to

00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:01,980
do and you also have to reinvent the

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,600
wheel you have to basically establish

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,340
the ground rules for contribution you

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,140
have to establish well do people pay a

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,650
fee to come in or do they do they not

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,450
how do we raise money for this to exist

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:14,250
if you have a certain type of project

00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:19,730
that may be worth exploring but I don't

00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:19,730
recommend it so Devon you had a question

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,059
yeah so let me let me reiterate that for

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,350
the camera in the folks at home hi folks

00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:56,419
at home everybody wave at the folks at

00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:59,100
home so to reiterate that there are

00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:01,320
organizations like the software freedom

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,880
law center that will help you with

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,500
incorporation and things if you go to

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,980
them and ask nicely and they have the

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,040
time and and so there are resources and

00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,299
you can certainly talk to other people

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,520
who have done it and they are usually

00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,110
very generous with their advice because

00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,080
they've made the mistakes and they will

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,970
tell you what they were probably as long

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,160
as they actually recognize what those

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,160
mistakes work David

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,900
now and for a couple reasons first of

00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:41,120
all there is the reinventing the wheel

00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:44,300
there is virtually movement that is

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,060
doing something unique enough that they

00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:51,170
need to go completely we do all that

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:58,370
work unless you can do complex

00:32:51,170 --> 00:33:01,040
personally I don't see anyone when I

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:04,760
send people trying to threaten

00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,250
foundations it's generally issues of

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,920
wanting to have independent but also

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:14,660
we're going to have control and I think

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:19,880
that purpose there's also so just so

00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:22,790
wrong challenges you typically want to

00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,190
become a 501 C 3 and becoming ottoman

00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:28,690
see briefer with Software Foundation is

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,690
incredibly organism

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:47,800
try to justify just by the EIRs and then

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:51,440
finally at the end of the day project is

00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,750
trying to get good outdoor why are you

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,330
trying to move on found a corporate

00:33:53,750 --> 00:34:00,500
entity when there are some good options

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:03,890
out there and you've listed every flavor

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,050
of software foundation from the livings

00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:09,800
foundation is very friendly corporations

00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:13,940
that you invest in a state to the

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:26,030
Eclipse Foundation to software public

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:27,800
interest or BASF individual focus so for

00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,419
the camera and the folks at home to sum

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,130
that up is it's a bad idea you're

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:40,070
reinventing the wheel there is no reason

00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:42,169
to do it yes one of the other there's

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,930
also the forming and services

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:47,810
organization around

00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:50,870
over another so you've got your

00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,760
corporation that sponsors the project

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:56,400
what's the viability of doing that

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,980
versus using about it Germany example in

00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,010
my Papa ansible an ansible works opennms

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,540
in the open an MS project okay those are

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:10,920
really just companies right their

00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:13,110
companies but they've also got company

00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,680
writing a product in the proprietary

00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:18,690
it's a company writing sure okay so the

00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,020
question was or the comment is basically

00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,520
there are groups that have found it

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,440
around companies that have founded

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,440
around open source projects like ansible

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,660
open MS I'll give some other examples

00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:36,450
that should send chills down people's

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:39,540
spine my sequel you know you basically

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:43,140
so that the thing is that's fine for

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,670
companies it's not fine for people who

00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,370
want to contribute that are not part of

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,470
that company and it's not fine for

00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,840
people who have a vested interest in

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:55,350
that existing as an open source project

00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,540
in the future because basically if you

00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,670
know that there are a limited number of

00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,350
people private individuals or a company

00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,820
that have control over that code base

00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,400
and it's important to your business and

00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,830
at some point they can be bought or they

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,980
can change the terms or they can you

00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:13,620
know do whatever that's not that's

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,540
that's not a foundation pardon the pun

00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,990
it's not a foundation for a healthy open

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,730
source project in the long term I now

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,610
there are people that I thoroughly

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:28,170
thoroughly 100% trust that deuce things

00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:30,060
like that Luke with puppet labs totally

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,440
trust Luke and his intentions and I

00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,760
would contribute to puppet in a

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,460
heartbeat but Luke is not immortal as

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,970
far as I know they have accepted venture

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,920
capital and puppet labs may someday not

00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,960
be puppet labs and the people who are

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,580
running puppet currently will not always

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,570
be the people running puppet and so it

00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,600
takes a lot of personal will

00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:58,210
to run a project for at least four to

00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,070
meet my standards of trust and even that

00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,840
is a little is a little concerning

00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,280
because eventually the people who have

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,280
earned that trust or no longer

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:56,290
interest can still work longer and even

00:37:49,040 --> 00:38:00,770
though they have interest and that is a

00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:02,120
to me that's incredibly compelling value

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,320
proposition for the software

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:08,000
foundation's is still get all our

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,870
goodness of people who want to offer

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,700
services around them get all been

00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:17,660
abysmal patent troll something's

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:22,460
contribute to developing it and at the

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:24,260
same time so get the knowledge that the

00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,810
software foundation protective

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:31,330
community's interest as opposed to the

00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,330
company which almost invariably at

00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:49,059
yeah yessir yeah so the question is can

00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:52,329
you take a GPL project to the asf and

00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,859
these the short and pithy answer to that

00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:58,119
is yes as long as it's not going to be

00:38:53,859 --> 00:39:00,910
GPL when you get done so yeah I mean

00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,710
cloudstack was in fact gplv3 and the

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,839
reason that they switch was two things

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,549
one obviously wanting to go to apache

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:09,460
and to feedback from their customers

00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:12,460
saying or potential customers saying we

00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,099
like open source but see the exorcist

00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:24,760
picture earlier in the presentation when

00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:27,220
we think about gplv3 so so the question

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:32,170
was do you have to track down all the

00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:33,760
contributors yes and no actually so in

00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,500
our case it wasn't necessarily about

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,849
contributors it was about some of the

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,430
libraries and things that we were using

00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:43,980
that we had to replace or figure out a

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,980
way not to distribute those but yes

00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,900
and try to get a

00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:30,590
and so in further response to the

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,840
question about finding the people that

00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,990
is a compelling case to if you know you

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,480
want to do something on this level take

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:40,550
it to apache or another foundation

00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,440
quickly don't you know try to do it on

00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,900
your own as a company and then after a

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,750
couple of years decide well now we're

00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,240
going to do this I think I could be

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,890
wrong on this I think companies and

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,110
startups are thinking more about that

00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,600
today than they did you know five ten

00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:59,750
years ago so I think they're more

00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:03,680
proactive in that way but yeah any other

00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:06,550
questions all right well things aren't

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,550
very much for your time

00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,410
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,599
way to better utilize all your resources

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:30,050
and it makes managing all your resources

00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:33,880
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:37,400
happening in open source the

00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,200
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,300
of the community and the speed at which

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,280
these are these you know these these

00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,589
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,440
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:51,440
that really shows the power of the of

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,890
the open source community it is global

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,440
and it's definitely because of the users

00:41:53,890 --> 00:42:03,080
community people are extremely friendly

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,970
and they're always ready to help if you

00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,250
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,980
guys helping each other out and they're

00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,690
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,680
the product is transparent for everyone

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:17,300
everyone can look at the code base

00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,339
everyone can see how growth dark is

00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:25,220
being built nothing nothing is

00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:27,859
proprietary everything is open in many

00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:32,060
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:35,810
ongoing health cloudstack the most

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:39,740
exciting event in recent memory for he

00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:42,380
was our first developer boot camp

00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,020
and our call gave people at maybe two

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,980
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:53,150
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:56,000
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:58,520
chairs in the room twice everything

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,790
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,850
is open source and so I don't think that

00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,590
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,619
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:12,170
computing and so i think it's i think

00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,700
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,810
about cloud computing you're really

00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:20,360
talking about open source cloud

00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:23,390
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,550
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:29,840
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:32,480
in each data centers these hardware is

00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:35,990
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,690
to handle number one that mass scale

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:41,840
number two it's designed to handle the

00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:44,390
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:48,920
deployments started working on cloud

00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:52,190
tech over four years ago and it was the

00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,960
original set of people working on it had

00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:58,070
a background of delivering software

00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:02,300
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:05,930
lots of users actually using it high

00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:08,990
availability is the key feature multiple

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:11,180
hypervisors support different network

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,180
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,950
better while step management server can

00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:19,640
be deployed in different physical

00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:21,290
machines it definitely has a huge

00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:26,300
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:28,880
there's a major movie studio that they

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:32,060
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,160
to transcode video and i thought that

00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,780
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,050
more fascinating is what they did during

00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:41,840
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:43,220
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,770
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,760
the instances and good

00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:50,200
doing a little work CloudStack is vast

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,730
it touches so many different aspects and

00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,950
there's no one person that's kind of

00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:57,400
like a master of all those realms I

00:44:53,950 --> 00:45:00,100
think clouds stack as a project is going

00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,900
to be one of the leaders simply because

00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:10,660
it's some of the most feature folan and

00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:13,800
and robust platforms out there adamstan

00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,800
your limit for the clouds dag

00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,500
your customers rely on your website or

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,869
application if it's slower

00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,779
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:40,640
and costs you money keeping your

00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:44,160
business critical systems humming along

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,980
requires insight into what they're doing

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,960
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,210
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,369
resource limitations and other problems

00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,289
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,900
your systems performance metrics in

00:45:55,289 --> 00:46:00,750
real-time and record this data for later

00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,730
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,770
see what's really going on under the

00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,900
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,880
visualize the status of all your systems

00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,609
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,730
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:17,190
memory swap processes load and network

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,770
usage click a specific system to access

00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,780
its individual dashboard then click and

00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,780
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,760
more detail comprehensive network data

00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,460
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,049
is available on the network tab and disk

00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,940
rights and free space on the disk

00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:35,789
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,339
displays usage statistics for individual

00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:40,500
processes the system info tab shows

00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:42,750
listening services active connections

00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,880
and available updates adding long view

00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,559
to a system is easy just click the

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,720
button copy the one line installation

00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,150
command then run the command on your

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,859
linux system to complete the process the

00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,049
agent will begin collecting data and

00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,890
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:59,470
start rolling

00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,840
use longview to gain visibility into

00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:05,110
your servers so when your website or app

00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,970
heats up it stays up most enterprises

00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:09,040
today realize that usernames and

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,840
passwords alone aren't enough to keep

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,270
their network saved from unauthorized

00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,710
intrusions that's my two-factor

00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:17,080
authentication has gotten so popular

00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,150
lately that adds that extra layer of

00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,000
protection enterprise networks need to

00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,470
stay safe but what you may not know is

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,810
that some two-factor authentication

00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:28,030
solutions they're better than others

00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:31,270
like two-factor strong authentication

00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:33,310
with wicked wicked goes beyond other

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,890
authentication systems by being less

00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:38,740
expensive easier to implement and easier

00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:40,390
to use giving software-based token

00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,270
clients built to run on all major

00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,840
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,190
Android these tokens utilize a

00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,590
public/private key combination that's

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,540
generated on device so there aren't any

00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,060
shared secrets flying around or

00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,910
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,770
special handling instead all keys are

00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:02,260
kept secure and private between the

00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,450
requesting token and your server which

00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,060
you control in house making it the most

00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,740
secure way possible to perform

00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,530
authentication encryption and with an

00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:14,320
extensive flexible API and support for

00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:16,300
protocols like al Dave and radius wicked

00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,680
works with any enterprise network

regardless of whether you're considering

00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:28,359
two-factor authentication for the first

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,599
time we're just ready to ditch your

00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:34,000
existing expensive key file system we

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:38,940
can help with easy to implement easy to

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,940
use strong authentication from wicked

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,960
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,910
ago we could not have imagined that

00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,100
asterisk would not only become the most

00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,260
widely adopted open source communication

00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,270
software on the planet but that it would

00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,790
impact the entire industry in the way

00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,770
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:03,410
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:05,360
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:07,430
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,869
transition of power from the hands of

00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,150
the traditional proprietary phone

00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:13,550
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,619
administrators of phone systems using

00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,270
this power our customers have traded all

00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,340
sorts of business changing applications

00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,140
from small office phone systems to

00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,240
mission-critical call centers the

00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,070
international carrier networks in fact

00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,540
there's even an entire country those

00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:29,000
communications infrastructure runs on

00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,920
esters the gym has always been about

00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,630
creating technology that expands

00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,820
communications capabilities in ways that

00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,990
we could never have imagined and that's

00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,390
part of what's game-changing about

00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,090
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,190
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,290
IP phones that extends control of the

00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,060
user all the way to the desktop the

00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,770
launch of these new products represents

00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,720
the next phase indigenous history of

00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:53,270
innovation these are the first and only

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,980
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,540
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,580
our expectations for building a family

00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,710
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,450
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,100
the team to build the phones such that

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,290
they were easy to install integrate

00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,150
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,700
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,320
that goal user feedback is validating

00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,450
that when it comes to operation with

00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,880
Astra space systems including our own

00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:19,460
Switchvox based product these are the

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,750
easiest to use best integrated most

00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,359
interoperable products on the market

00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,330
today the digital ear phones will

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,380
initially include three IP des hommes

00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,330
uniquely designed to complement any

00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,190
asterisks or switch box based solution

00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:33,859
these phones are different for a number

00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:36,530
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:37,940
designed for use with esters secondly

00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:39,550
we've made it really easy to

00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,960
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:43,640
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,570
to access information inside of

00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,600
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:49,590
between an application and the phone

00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,720
additionally we've created an

00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,850
applications engine that allows users

00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,430
and developers to create and run their

00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:58,500
own apps on the following and finally

00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,570
we've done all of this at a very

00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,250
compelling price point at digium we're

00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,050
always thinking of ways to give our

00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,420
customers the best value in business

00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:08,280
phone systems and also give them the

00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,440
power to create their own solutions or

00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,330
eating communications challenge will

00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,040
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:16,050
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,670
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:20,160
asterisk and what communications even

00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:23,840
easier and together we'll change the way

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,840
