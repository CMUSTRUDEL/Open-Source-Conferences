the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,330
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:39,570
possible can we turn that yeah all right

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:40,590
we good all right guys today we're here

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,090
to talk about don't be a target

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,430
protecting yourself when you're outside

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,050
your network my name is Tim Fowler I'm

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,930
network engineer it's about technology

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,000
big disclaimer the very beginning of

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,030
this presentation I'm going to be

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,160
demonstrating some wireless essentially

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,800
wireless hacking methodologies and

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,930
attacks that you're vulnerable to in the

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,350
outside you do not have to participate

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,549
in this in these demonstrations I'll let

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,100
you know when it's there about to happen

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,020
if you don't want to participate you can

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,610
just simply disable your wireless for

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,930
just a couple of minutes but I do

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,030
encourage you to actually participate

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,470
because it's really really fun it's

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,020
really really cool what you're going to

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,100
see is a little bit creepy because most

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,860
of you guys are going to be connecting

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,110
back to me automatically and I'm going

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,700
to show you how that works and the end

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,259
of the result of this presentation is

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,450
how do you protect yourself against

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,890
people like me no this is I'll go ahead

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,900
and tell you I've got I've got a little

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,150
portable router right here but it's not

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,520
internet connected at all I'm going to

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,670
walk through every step of what I'm

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,490
doing mine go ahead and tell you there's

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,040
nothing completely nothing harm if you

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,720
exit you should be seeing an access

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,850
point a right now is called don't be a

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,829
target does anybody see that if you pull

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,920
up your wireless networks you'll see

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,060
that that's actually me but don't worry

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,409
there's a no internet connection

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,360
nothing's harmful I'm going to be

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,790
completely transparent with what's going

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
on this is an educational course this is

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,660
not i'm not going to actually teach you

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,670
the methodologies of having doing this

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,830
i'm going to explain what's going on

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,209
and how to prevent that but this is not

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:21,540
actually hacking 101 so that being said

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,860
i will give you enough fair warning one

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,310
this is about happen but i do encourage

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:30,330
you there is an entertainment value to

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,319
what's going to be taking place the

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,550
first thing we're going to talk about

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,630
with in this talk is convenient

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,080
specifically convenience in networking

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,340
there's always a cost inconvenience

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,750
we're always going to sacrifice

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,209
something or it's going to physically

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,650
cause to something I've got three

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,450
examples of convenience here we've got a

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,920
convenience store that's actually

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,769
supposed to be movie tickets that you

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,209
purchase online and we also have toilet

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,040
paper which is we're going to get to in

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,530
just a moment the first thing

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,540
convenience store we all have them will

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,030
run go get a drink a bag of chips or

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,709
something like that but what would

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,340
typically do is we end up paying more

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,900
for those products because we're not

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,989
going to like a big box or something

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,010
we're paying for the convenience factor

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,840
and this is something that you need to

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,750
keep in mind when it comes to your

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,480
security is what is this convenience

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,720
factor going to cost me same thing with

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,510
like a ticketmaster Fandango anybody use

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,040
those services well if you do at the

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,630
very right before you go and actually

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
check out you'll see this lovely thing

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,239
called convenience charge or convenience

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,690
fee you're paying more money for the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,989
convenience toilet paper is really

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,820
really interesting um does anybody here

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,010
let's we were really open here seen by

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:52,230
the absolute cheapest toilet paper that

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,340
they can okay so we got one okay I was

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,590
about to say you're probably college

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,840
student okay typically we make an

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,910
investment in toilet paper by that but

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,859
better stuff because it serves us much

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,079
better I maintain there's two things in

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,209
life you don't skimp on toilet paper and

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,630
Oreos if you've ever had a knockoff Oreo

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,700
it's disgusting always get the name ram

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,069
so so we've all we've already got these

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,889
methodologies in our systems where we're

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,900
used to to sacrificing something their

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,409
financial but we also have this example

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,550
here where we're actually going we're

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:26,340
giving our money for a bed

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,039
our service for a better Darris a user

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,909
experience with toilet paper so this is

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,379
something I want you to keep in mind

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:35,190
we're already doing this in our daily

00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:37,319
lives but we're not doing it when we're

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:42,810
dealing with networks and that's got to

00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:45,659
change what is the cost of convenience

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:51,449
in networking there's one really simple

00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:54,930
answer to this security security and

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:57,659
convenience if i'll make us if i have a

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,770
network system that is convenient to the

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:04,530
end-user i'm typically it's at the cost

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,139
of security the perfect example is this

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,020
anybody familiar with WPS Wi-Fi

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,430
Protected setup horrible horrible

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,610
horrible horrible horrible horrible

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,580
horrible horrible thing it's awful it

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,500
was like hey I can go push a button and

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,020
now my clients can automatically connect

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,729
there was two fundamental flaws in this

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,289
process and it was the way the standard

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:28,949
was written the first you have an eight

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,960
digit pin number it's only numeric so I

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,000
could brute force that she's you've got

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,639
eight to the tenth power you know so I

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,039
think that's a 10 billion I'm not good

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,419
with my exponents but 10 billion hundred

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,919
billion it's a it's a lot but I can

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,279
steal brute force that's over enough

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,800
time well they implemented it so that

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,900
they break the pin in half you calculate

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,479
the first four digits you complete a

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,430
handshake then you can calculate the

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,569
next three digits and the last ones of

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,930
song checksum so now I have four to ten

00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:02,729
to the fourth plus ten to the third

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,409
eleven thousand possibilities I can

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:10,909
brute force you and under 20 hours and

00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:13,740
they thought this was a good idea well

00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:17,550
WPS came about because of an invention

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,550
of from Microsoft called windows 7 they

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,639
wanted it to make it user-friendly one

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,060
of the up specifications of WPS is the

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,469
fact that any router access point hasn't

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,000
it what's called an internal registrar

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,029
and that's what actually contains all

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,620
your information your SSID your

00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,460
encryption level your password thing

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,610
like that

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,210
WPS by this standard has to respond to

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,740
an external registrar what that it has

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,180
anybody ever plugged up a brand new out

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,550
of the box router to a Windows 7 machine

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,410
and it's like hey would you like to set

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,110
up your network is anybody seeing that

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,490
okay that's the external registrar

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,680
windows seven acts as an external

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,570
registrar I can actually pass your

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,200
networking information to the router

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,900
from the host you can yeah you can

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,420
completely bypass that but it has the

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:11,440
default standard requires it to respond

00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,780
to that so now I brute force your pin

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,740
number your router hands me all your

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,770
information and I'm going no here's your

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,050
SSID here's your password here's your

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,440
security level and it's like alright

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,720
that's cool I'm cool with that so we

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,710
have this really convenient feature

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,290
that's ridiculously insecure and so what

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,360
was the expense its security typically

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,410
open networks and we're about to discuss

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:47,260
those open networks come with a huge

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:48,370
convenience cost of security one thing

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:53,260
we're going to talk about is what is

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:55,570
valuable to you sensitive data your

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,910
email address facebook account banking

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,070
in from of your children's information

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,000
this this messes with a lot of parents

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:05,820
and parents here how would you feel

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,490
knowing that something you did at

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,580
starbucks made your child's information

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,080
vulnerable not a good feeling as a

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,660
parent knowing that you're putting your

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,430
child's future at risk so these are

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,340
things we have to ask ourselves every

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,760
single day what is my data worth to to

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,380
me because to me your information

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,690
doesn't have a value but to you it does

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,940
and we have to the only person that's

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,550
going to care about your data is going

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,390
to be you we have to take an offensive

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,620
approach to protecting our information

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:42,220
specifically when we're outside of our

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,190
network I'm going to talk about a couple

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,530
of weaknesses in 808 or to dot11 because

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,040
this is specifically the the vector that

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,690
I'm going to

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,579
about the first one is remembered

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,920
networks by default almost every single

00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:55,570
internet-connected device available in

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,790
the market remembers networks that you

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,220
connect to by default you can easily

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,019
disable this feature go ahead and do it

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,779
you can do it right now if you would

00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:08,470
like remember networks actually puts you

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:11,860
at a very vulnerable state because and

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,839
you'll see in an instance your computer

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,490
is always looking for that network and

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,209
it's always looking through that network

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,500
through probe requests and responses

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:24,550
every remember network that you have in

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,980
your device list is sending out a probe

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,199
request and it's simply saying hey Jim

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,300
is your Wi-Fi around and if it doesn't

00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,889
get a response is like okay and in just

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,990
a little bit later it's like hey Jim is

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,899
your Wi-Fi around and that's what

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,160
enables us to go from our home network

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,500
quickly to our office network without

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,750
actually having a lot you know switch

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,410
networks login or inner password stuff

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,670
it's doing it for us why because it's

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:53,529
convenient there again what do we what's

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,639
the cause of this convenience and a

00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,300
little bit i'm just i'm going to show

00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,819
you the cost is your security also auto

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,000
association of to the AP this is a part

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:06,610
of the response hey Jim your Wi-Fi round

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,220
yes I'm around cool I'm going to connect

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,610
alright cool it happens automatically

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,730
you didn't do anything there was no user

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,800
interaction to connect to the Wi-Fi it's

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,680
very convenient but here again this is a

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,680
this is an issue with in 802 911 that

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:27,399
actually puts you at risk down the line

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,010
that we're about to see trust

00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,389
relationships at some point in time

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,430
you're going to have to trust somebody

00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:37,720
with your internet connection how many

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,250
people here trust their isp okay let me

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,930
take one step back how many people trust

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:45,220
their home network okay to a degree and

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,139
part of the reason you probably don't

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,410
trust your home network is because the

00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:56,170
ISP let's be honest okay how many people

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:58,840
trust Starbucks Wireless alright how

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,420
many people trust me

00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,980
good answer you should not trust me are

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,510
already at this point you shouldn't

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,720
trust me i'm going to give you even more

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,220
ammunition for that fire so at some

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,480
point time you're going to have to trust

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,920
somebody with your internet connection

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,890
that doesn't it whether you're running

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,050
through a VPN or you're at your works

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,000
office your home office you're going to

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,620
trust somebody to be able to see what

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,620
you're doing on the internet and have

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,150
access to your data the question is who

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,010
are you going to trust where are you

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,150
going to put your trust I'm definitely

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:33,160
not going to trust self public network I

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,140
know the guys that set up the network

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,220
they're really cool I'm not going to

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,340
trust them with my internet connection

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,070
with the data that I'm sitting across I

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,720
trust my home network because I for the

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,460
most part have control over it with the

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,320
exception of the ISP so if I have the

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,170
opportunity to get back to my home

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,900
network to a more trusted location I

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:56,590
need to do that and we're so that's what

00:11:52,900 --> 00:12:01,270
we're going to be talking about open

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:03,610
networks real simple don't do it real

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,440
simple don't connect open networks and

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:10,360
I'll show you why here in just a few

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:13,300
moments everybody knows what karma is we

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,900
all know the phrase Karma's a well

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,910
it really really is and if you do not

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,470
want to participate here in the next few

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,260
moments go ahead and disable your

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,290
wireless now because I'm getting ready

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:30,600
out to activate karma karma is infant

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,650
body familiar with host apd ok it's a

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,330
it's a piece of software that allows you

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,000
to run an access point on a linux box

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:40,330
really powerful really really cool well

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,550
karma is a patch version of hostapd it

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,320
was produced by a guy that goes by

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,330
digital ninja I can't remember his name

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,800
right off hand but it's really really

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:54,070
huh yes yes really really cool really

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:59,920
really powerful um but is it exactly

00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:01,480
what it is so as you guys are disabling

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,900
your wireless I'm actually going to

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,460
enable karma just for a second and I'm

00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,769
going to explain what Karma's about to

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,959
do to you guys probe request

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,239
everybody sending out many many probe

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,189
request right now looking for networks

00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:22,410
that they you that they're used to

00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:24,119
connecting to karma simply says this is

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,999
how it works the probe request goes out

00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:30,720
hey Jim is your wireless network here

00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:33,179
karma goes yep and if that's if you're

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,079
sending out a pro request for an open

00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:39,959
network you will connect to me

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,850
automatically I am now your ISP I'm the

00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,369
men in the middle I control your

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,489
internet I control everything you do on

00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:50,579
the Internet I can from here from this

00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:52,259
device now I have open rain on what I

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:58,470
can do the manipulation of track yes

00:13:52,259 --> 00:14:01,319
question ok what we're going to talk

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,699
about that in at the end of the

00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:09,749
presentation as far as how to protect

00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:12,529
yourself so let me show get this up you

00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,529
beat one second

00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:24,279
I don't pull this over to the screen all

00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:27,069
right karma is officially enabled on

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,290
this device so if you guys start we'll

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,970
start checking your wireless devices

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,949
what you'll start to see is in just a

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,790
few moments you'll start to see networks

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:38,549
that you clearly know we're not here

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,709
specifically like your home network

00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:42,819
things of that nature and it's already

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,589
working so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:47,799
going to pull this over here and put

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:50,559
this up and what you're going to see is

00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:53,499
this list on here and this is a list of

00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:57,369
access points that devices are actually

00:14:53,499 --> 00:15:03,179
actively trying to connect to so we've

00:14:57,369 --> 00:15:05,709
got guests UNCC 49er who's that okay

00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,439
nine or Wi-Fi secure that's probably you

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,670
again man you're you're probably going

00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:11,649
to get them you're probably going to get

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,170
the most because you're you guys are

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,639
closest to the antenna get up what

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,879
somebody's actually connected to me

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:22,149
who's on guest anybody anybody has ever

00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,910
connected to a guest okay you're mine I

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,019
own you now you're coming through me now

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,339
you actually don't have internet access

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:33,309
so don't worry you're safe but in a real

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:35,199
world instance I would bridge my

00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:38,619
internet access that I have on my laptop

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,179
to this router so now i'm serving

00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:41,649
internet directly from the access point

00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:43,360
you you were actually thinking you were

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:47,049
connected well were you previously

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,739
connected to a network before this your

00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:53,379
own self well what happened why did you

00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:55,149
connect me you were on a network because

00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:58,449
you're in closer proximity I'm in closer

00:15:55,149 --> 00:16:01,839
proximity to you then the self access

00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:03,819
point is to your system so it's always

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,189
sending out pro request even if you're

00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:10,689
connected to a network so you just

00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:15,309
network hopped and did nothing your

00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:16,989
system did that on its own question was

00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:20,169
it's a comp it's a combination it is

00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:22,449
technically signal strength um but I I

00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:24,579
currently have a 9dbi in 10 on there so

00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:26,379
i can actually you know reach out the

00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,270
Wi-Fi adapter that's like our chipset

00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:29,370
that's in this as a

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,160
little low power it's designed to be a

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:35,400
close proximity honeypot but I've

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,560
actually converted this over to run on a

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,470
full-blown laptop with a lot more power

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,510
and you can do some really little things

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:46,350
but it's all about the response time of

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:50,190
that network if if I respond to your

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,230
probe faster than self does it's going

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,170
to revert also it deals with network

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,150
priority if you connect to guest more

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,950
and you have it hiring your list it's

00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:09,720
going to force that connection over

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:11,010
question yeah perfect yep perfect exists

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,680
and this is something we're going to get

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:16,290
into the vendor network okay the vendor

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,680
network is encrypted it has a passkey

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:23,480
the one limitation to karma is that it

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,480
doesn't have the authentification keys

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,770
well yeah in some time and it's all its

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,180
its Channel javi there's to it it's

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,760
doing a lot of things and it doesn't

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,520
work all the time for every single

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,200
Network and things like that but and

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,880
it's mostly geared towards looking at

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,100
multiple pro request seeing you know

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:54,180
especially if there's multiple devices

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:56,790
yes young because it is a higher

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,260
priority to maintain that level of

00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,970
security I mean because they're you do

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,790
have a natural natural hierarchy and

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,170
that security model so let's let's

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:09,170
scroll down and see if we've got any

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,170
more fun victims I mean uh volunteers oh

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:18,060
yeah look at all those associations look

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,230
at let's see and I I typically will we

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,880
actually have a lot of people that are

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,190
connected directly to me don't be a

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:29,220
target I encourage you to move up if you

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:33,360
can't see asus underscore Clark alright

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:38,279
cool your president boardwalk orchard

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:45,269
garden ATT 6168 ETO 32

00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:48,419
um southern derm guests fig Duke Blue

00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:52,049
who are you please leave no I'm just

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,700
kidding just kidding but as you can see

00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,820
and if you actually pull up your

00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,179
device's you'll see these networks being

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,919
broadcast available to you but your

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,440
computers are doing this automatically

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:11,279
and this is a huge vulnerability that

00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:14,249
you have question why is your home

00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,219
network showing up okay perfect but it's

00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:19,499
encrypted right you have a password okay

00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:21,989
what is it still you're still sending

00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:25,109
out a probe request so it's like and

00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:26,999
it's still responding yes I am here the

00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:31,259
issue is you can't authenticate to it

00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:33,269
because I karma doesn't hold the key so

00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,519
if you'll never okay but it's still a

00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,919
viable access point but it's just

00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,669
because the credentials don't match

00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:44,909
it'll never force a connection but

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:47,609
you're seeing it there okay well and

00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:49,799
like I said so there's us some chipsets

00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:52,019
are now starting to do different things

00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:54,719
with their pro requests so not all of

00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:57,210
them do show up but the majority of them

00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:58,859
will and sometimes it takes a while

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,379
because especially in a group of this

00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:02,669
many people it is responding to a lot of

00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,710
probe request and it's a very small

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,440
hardware it's like 400 megahertz on the

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,029
processor so it's it's really working

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,009
overtime trying to respond to all these

00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:13,109
pro requests and authenticate people and

00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:15,299
in doing things like that so you want

00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,469
all the time see everything now if we

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,929
were in a small just like a one-on-one

00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:20,339
session I would be ninety-five percent

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,519
confident that you would in fact see

00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:22,519
your

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,840
well that we're going to talk about that

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,250
here in Justin Justin just a moment so

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:37,770
if you sir do me do me a favor and go to

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,140
any pull up your browser since you're

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:46,370
nice enough to connect with me and go to

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:52,260
17 to 16 dot 42 1 and that's the actual

00:20:46,370 --> 00:21:00,150
routers IP address 172 dot 1642 dot one

00:20:52,260 --> 00:21:04,049
dot forty two dot one won't pull this

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:06,809
back for just a moment and and let you

00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:09,440
if you'll let me know what you get you

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,440
shouldn't get much

00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:24,200
I was showing me as we're still

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,490
connected to the soul okay anybody want

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,500
anybody want to connect don't be a

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:37,160
target voluntarily okay he's got it nine

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:41,720
cat hit refresh yeah whatever you want

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,520
to do command f5 whatever you know I

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:51,380
have five depending on your function

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:54,020
buttons and okay yeah nine cats doing

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,510
what what this is i'm running a little

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,310
package called random rick roll and as

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,980
you refresh the pages and you go to all

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:03,530
these if you keep going to this address

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:07,790
you're going to get peanut butter jelly

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:09,860
time afro circus never going to give you

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:13,940
up in ascii characters and it plays the

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:16,370
music and it's a representation of the

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,640
the ability that i have i'm in there but

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:23,060
i can do this on the dns level i can run

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,240
what's called dns spoof because i'm the

00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:29,660
man in the middle lanes here and say mmm

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,450
every dot com that you go to I want to

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,000
redirect you here or I want to do this

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,330
with you oh it is so I have full control

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,950
over your over your internet and we're

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,870
gonna get back to this in just just a

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,510
little bit another issue anybody

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,200
familiar with firesheep okay really cool

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,850
firefox instinct shin a extension that

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,550
basically pulls unencrypted session

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,140
cookies out of the air and you can plug

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,430
them directly into firefox and now i can

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,130
be logged in as your Facebook or

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,170
whatever stuff I haven't used this in

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,450
about six or seven eight months though

00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,820
but this is a real world thing that was

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,100
got a lot of publicity about a year a

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,320
year and a half ago on this is a real

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,610
world some system that's called side

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,620
jacking where you're actually stealing

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,780
the cookies injecting them into your

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,960
browser and now I'm you so this is just

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,170
another attack that is widely available

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,550
on the internet I do a search firesheep

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,940
and you'll get a wealth of knowledge

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,230
that DNS print redirection I'm your isp

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,090
now I'm the man in the middle I can see

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,400
here and go I can send you anywhere you

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,260
want to

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,550
all right let me afraid I can send you

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,920
anywhere I want you to go right and so

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,420
you can get really malicious with this

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,700
type of technology with this type of

00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,370
system I don't do that i do it for an

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,980
educational purpose but you guys can see

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:50,940
the potential damage that can be done

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:54,960
with this fishing this is a big issue

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm hosting a web server directly on

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:04,080
this router I can contain fake facebook

00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:05,550
twitter all these different banks there

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,580
there is actually an entire repository

00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:11,280
of nothing but fishing template HTML

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,350
templates for for all these online

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,090
services and stuff that I can load up

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,500
directly into the web server and i can

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:23,370
redirect you to to that to actual page

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,360
on the router now obviously it's there's

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,500
going to be some things that you're

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,840
going to see this looks a little bit

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,650
different if you go to facebook com it's

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,820
actually going to take you to

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:34,290
facebook.com / index.html by default

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:37,470
which is a little bit different you

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,720
don't see index HTML and then sometimes

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,600
you also see like facebook.com /

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,720
facebook dot HTML you'll start to see

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,000
these weird add-ons here your URL that

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,000
you're not accustomed to seeing when

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,020
you're doing these kind of attacks and

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,270
so you've got to be aware of what's

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,460
actually going on and we're going to get

00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,190
into the issue of HTTPS because i know

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,320
somebody hears thinking oh i use https i

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,750
check all the time we're going to get to

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,320
that in just a moment and you're going

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:10,590
to be severely disappointed what will it

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,580
cost you all these attack vectors and

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,500
things that we've talked about these

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,750
possible attacks there's a lot more out

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,670
there there's a lot more packed in this

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,610
particular device that I use that I

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,650
haven't even begun to describe the

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,620
service on with you guys but it's

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,420
outside the scope of this conversation

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,850
but everything that you've seen and

00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:33,870
other things is really possible it

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:38,460
really happens for real give you an

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:40,350
example I was paid to do a as a

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,590
contractor to do wireless penetration

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:46,299
and social engineering on

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,029
in test for a company and we we worked

00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,559
out and we knew that the coffee shop

00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:53,260
right across the road from the company

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,520
was frequently visited by employees in

00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,840
the afternoon and they would work from

00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,669
there so I set up shop there because i

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,200
had my tools I was like I'm gonna have

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,010
some fun see what I see what information

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,779
I can get about the company externally I

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,520
was there about 45 minutes sitting in

00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,080
the coffee shop just I was actually

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,240
probably on facebook but I had this

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:18,640
device on him and low and hold the vice

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,610
president of accounts comes into the

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,950
coffee shop orders some drink and he

00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,270
sits down and I sits down where I'm

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,970
actually behind him and I can actually

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,730
see what he's doing and he logs into his

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,539
company's SharePoint site that's

00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:39,789
publicly facing but it's over HTTPS he's

00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:41,500
protected right wrong using a using

00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,190
something that I'm going to discuss here

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,169
in a minute called ssl strip it allowed

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,390
me to actually strip away the SSL and

00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:51,880
see his username and password in plain

00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:56,200
text like okay so i have username and

00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,570
password well i sent the username and

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,700
password five texts to my partner who

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,950
was actually inside the company doing

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,130
the rest of the actual physical pen test

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,929
and within 15 minutes I got a phone call

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:13,690
center we got to go we got to meet with

00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:15,850
management now turns out that SharePoint

00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:19,480
was taught was controlled by active

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:22,899
directory inside the other inside the

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,510
company's network the IT department is

00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:30,179
brilliant as they were made every

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:30,179
manager level employee a domain admin

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:38,980
so within about an hour's time of

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,920
initiating this test we had domain admin

00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:45,450
access and specifically we had access to

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:51,490
all 16 years financial data pin test

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:53,200
over major debriefing the VP got called

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,670
in he came in he was in tears he thought

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,620
it was gonna be fired and we had to

00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,270
reassure him he did nothing wrong this

00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,840
was not his fault this was not a

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:04,330
end-users fault this was a network IT

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,250
fault this was a security issue that had

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,660
to be addressed and we went through a

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,210
lot of addresses and this is that this

00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,130
was a really unique situation where

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,580
everything just lined up purse up

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,370
perfectly but let's jump over to you

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:22,060
you're sitting and coffee shop you're

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:25,720
surfing the internet you log into oh I

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,490
don't know your email and the same

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,030
attack is going on I'm sitting behind

00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:32,560
you you're connected to me what's the

00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:37,270
dangers of me having your email address

00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:40,830
what was your name sir Jason Jason can

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:47,500
have your email and password please

00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:49,150
please okay all right okay is there is

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,910
anybody willing to give me your credit

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:54,250
card number and PIN I need I want the

00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,750
pen as well okay nobody's going to do

00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:00,130
that because 1 i'm a complete stranger

00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:01,810
into that's completely stupid well we're

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,520
giving this informational what are we're

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:06,490
making it so that this information we're

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,050
just handing it off to somebody but

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,510
we're not checking behind ourselves to

00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,490
make sure that it's actually secure so i

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,530
want you to think what would the worst

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:19,480
possible situation be if i took over

00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:23,110
your primary email account forgot

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,090
password is huge anybody using a second

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,520
email address talk to authorize or

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,720
authenticate the first one well now

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,220
we're going to start daisy chaining

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,720
anybody ever use a repeat password

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,080
nobody better raise their hand don't do

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,850
it don't use repeat passwords anybody

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,950
use online banking amazon netflix

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,419
facebook twitter guess what i'm now

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,929
all of these services are tied to your

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,549
email address I control them I control

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:53,980
your email address i control your

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:57,370
digital image this can be catastrophic

00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,779
there was an example of a journalist

00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,480
that this happened to and there was a

00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:02,500
little bit of stupidity and things

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,960
social engineering where this happened

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,320
to a few Joe but this is a this is a

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:14,799
real instance this can actually happen

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:17,860
and nobody cares about your security at

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,830
all I don't care about it fact be less

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,539
secure it makes it my job easier I don't

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,350
have to work actually I don't it doesn't

00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:29,529
have to work as hard but you have to be

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,149
actively concerned about your security

00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:33,070
when you're out in public when you're

00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:34,600
away from your home network that should

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,690
be the first thing you think about is

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,760
how am I vulnerable what am I giving up

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,309
by connecting to a self networker to

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,620
this network or to that Network it has

00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:48,389
accuse me has to be at the forefront of

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,980
every every conversation that you have

00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:55,419
you dare to venture outside but need

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,860
internet now what huh what we're going

00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,080
to get in that and I'm personally not

00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,990
not a big fan of tour I'm just because

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,870
it's just so slow but there's options

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,029
how do I protect myself we've seen that

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,830
the types of attacks and things that

00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:12,490
this gentleman was so kind to connect

00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:15,370
directly to me I didn't initiate it at

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:17,500
all he did it or his device did it this

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,049
is essentially that karma is actually

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,279
social engineering your computer which

00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:24,370
is kind of cool when you look at it in

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,380
that terms like I mean it's like pulling

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,139
up at a valet you got a real sketchy

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:34,750
dude stand there like you the valet yeah

00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:36,070
man really you know but it on the

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,889
networking I was like alright that's

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:42,850
cool yeah you don't look sketch but in

00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:45,100
reality we are encrypter traffic and

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,750
there's many many ways to do this so and

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:53,039
this is we're going to discuss things

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:53,039
like you said tour and things like that

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:01,260
vpns VPN service providers are dirt

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,990
cheap you can get them for around five

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,690
dollars a month if you want to you can

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:09,090
change the level security openvpn runs

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,770
pretty fast so you're not going to lose

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,290
a lot of your throughput on your

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,960
internet connection anybody like to do

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,820
really cool stuff with ssh tunnels you

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,520
can actually run SSH tunnels with a

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:24,510
socks proxy and you can encrypt all of

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:27,300
your web traffic your network selection

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,370
be careful be conscious about what

00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,410
networks you're choosing to connect to

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:39,330
has anybody had the pleasure of going to

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:41,250
defcon okay the wall of sheep I've been

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,890
on the wall sheep twice most

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,900
embarrassing thing in my life because I

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:52,650
was stupid about my network selection

00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:56,180
and they made me pay cellular networks

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:59,310
how many people use have broadband cards

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,200
mobile hotspots mobile hotspots gets a

00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,040
little bit different because you are

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,410
broadcasting a wireless network I only

00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,120
do my banking through my cellular

00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,250
network I don't do it on my home Wi-Fi

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,330
on home network I don't do it in public

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:20,600
Wi-Fi currently cellular technology is I

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:23,340
will not use the word secure it's

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,620
obscure we don't we're just now

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,680
developing the tools specifically on GSM

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,330
not so much I'll see ma to actually be

00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,530
able to test the security of these

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,590
networks how are there any

00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:36,180
vulnerabilities like we see in Wi-Fi and

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,920
actually be able to jump on these

00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,110
carrier networks and kind of play man in

00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,030
the middle and do these things so until

00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,870
the technology and the price point of

00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:47,610
all this stuff comes down there is a

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:51,450
level of security through obscurity just

00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:54,260
because I can't infiltrate that yet

00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,260
question

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:03,160
yes that is that is different now the

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:06,309
thing here is typically they're using

00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,129
wpa two keys which you can crack those

00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:11,230
if you've got enough force you know in

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,360
computational power and all but as a

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,659
whole system as a mobile system on the

00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,909
go that offers you a level of protection

00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,700
versus Wi-Fi and the other thing is it

00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:24,129
gets back to the trust factor do you

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:27,300
trust your carrier or do you trust

00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:31,119
Starbucks Wireless with me sitting in it

00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,399
okay I actually trust my cell phone

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,710
carrier a lot more than I do my isp as

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,060
well I don't think I do anymore because

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,010
all the stuff that's come out with the

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,020
NSA and stuff it really doesn't matter

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,060
anymore it's like having your data

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,129
center there's there's a why coming out

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:49,600
of it one goes to the Internet and the

00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:53,710
other goes to the Internet also known as

00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,869
the NSA so the use of cellular networks

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,510
and cellular broadband is something that

00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:01,960
I would encourage you two guys to to use

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,210
as opposed to a public Wi-Fi system so

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,010
at least you have the control over you

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,890
can restrict who's connecting to it I

00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,680
don't have a methodology for replicating

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,600
your keys until I actually track your

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,910
keys well if you're in starbucks I

00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,260
unless your password is one two three

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,850
four five six seven eight nine ten or

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,310
something like that i am not going to

00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,830
have enough time to to actively crack

00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,980
your key then to be able to do anything

00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:29,650
so eat like the hot spot features the

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,470
the my thighs and things like that for

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:35,290
now they offer a love of security just

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,450
because you actually control to a degree

00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,920
that you can't in a public setting I

00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,570
don't think Jeremy and the guys are

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,550
going to let you just come in here mess

00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,160
with the self network for your own

00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,750
security features which you can do that

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,170
a little bit with with the cellular

00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,170
networks

00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,590
alright then for some reason to cut the

00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,030
last slide off um but yeah things like

00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,650
you know things like SS a challenge

00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,970
you've got to encrypt your traffic it

00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:08,590
just hands then you've got to encrypt it

00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,110
they're their services how many people

00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:14,560
familiar with openvpn how many people

00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:16,480
own an openvpn server shame on you guys

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,720
for not only men want you can run this

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:25,210
in virtualbox vmware you got an old

00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,190
laptop saw Lubuntu sudo apt-get openvpn

00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:30,310
SAS for the access server you get two

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,540
for two free client certificates you can

00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,860
use it anywhere where you can use on

00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,890
yourself when you can use on your mac

00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:38,470
your your windows and this offers you no

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,470
matter where you're at in the world you

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:43,720
can tunnel back home which has its added

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:46,870
advantages because you can now use your

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,240
home network resources you know you got

00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,640
an ass at home but you're here in

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,310
Charlotte paying nine dollars a day for

00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:58,150
Wi-Fi in the hotel room you want to go

00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:01,900
back and watch or stream videos that you

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:03,610
legally obtained you can do that it adds

00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,790
another level but the biggest thing is

00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:11,140
this thing it's encrypted and with karma

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:12,760
specifically it hands encryption just

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,690
like you would expect any other access

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,540
point to I can see your data stream I

00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:21,610
can't touch it I can I can see that

00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,950
you're connected to me I can see all

00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,690
this traffic going you know if I do i do

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,240
a packet capture I can see this

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,720
encrypted stream but unless I can

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,280
actually break the encryption you know

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,580
later because I'm not definitely not

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,220
gonna be able to do it in real time I

00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:42,070
can't do anything so if but like I've

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:45,460
been on VPN this entire conference and

00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:48,990
the sum of any I actually use VPN even

00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,490
when i'm in the office and stuff because

00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,590
it doesn't matter I'm not as worried

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,800
about who i connect to because i know it

00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:59,650
leaves my traffic and my passwords are

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,320
encrypted so like over open VPN which is

00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,619
using ssl let's say I log into Facebook

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,970
using HTTPS well I have an S

00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:12,759
SL tunnel and then HTTP s which is

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,319
another ssl going through that I'm not

00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:17,859
worried about somebody stealing my

00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:18,880
passwords yet eventually we'll probably

00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:20,470
get there I mean there's there's

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,559
methodologies and there's things like

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,119
that but as a generic as a general

00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,180
principle I'm not as worried about

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,099
because I do have a level of encryption

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,900
that's available to me and I as an

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:35,170
outside person I'm having a hard time

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:46,900
getting into that tunnel question or

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:49,450
statement some riders had to write

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:52,480
firmware or they don't have the right

00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:55,390
security options to be like the Gateway

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,420
the gatekeeper you know I voted for a

00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:02,319
bit and um Ghostbusters and the

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,630
gatekeeper he he decides which passes in

00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:07,299
an L yeah so it's a way to like make it

00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,849
more superior order are you as far as

00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:11,559
your home network yeah there's there's

00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:13,869
things the first thing if you're using

00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:17,289
standard firmware I recommend everybody

00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:19,239
here to go buy a router that actually

00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:22,119
supports third-party open source

00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,849
software I can't recommend dd-wrt

00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:29,230
anymore I used to big big proponent

00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:31,359
until I found out that by default and

00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,489
they refused to change this that if i

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:38,099
have a-- gate to your public IP address

00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:41,259
their your router is i can log into it

00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,660
all you do is add a firewall rule you

00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:46,720
can fix that but that they refuse to add

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,509
that so I was doing I was doing is going

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,400
through a block of our third-party VPN

00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:53,470
service providers IP address 1000

00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,759
address is going to find about 170

00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:59,529
dd-wrt routers publicly facing and I was

00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:03,339
like that's so disappointing but you can

00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:07,200
check out like tomato you can't look at

00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:10,029
DD RT open wrt my company we produce a

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,640
build of tomato that has VPN

00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:13,839
capabilities are and so on some

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,220
different features so i definitely look

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,690
at that because that gives you a I'm

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,040
granular control than your stock

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,420
firmware you can you can start

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,040
manipulating you can start blocking

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,869
specific types of traffic and things

00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,090
like that where the start with it i

00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:29,420
honestly believe consumer router

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:31,369
companies just don't give a flip there's

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,070
like here you go this is what you need

00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:35,810
that this is more than enough and am i

00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:44,750
coming specific we're trying to just do

00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:46,670
away with that completely I I personally

00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:51,140
don't haven't used a gateway server so I

00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:53,359
really can't answer that question yeah

00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:56,240
I'm really not sure I'm just because I

00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,830
I've never had a need for it I've

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,720
typically run open source routing

00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,640
platforms and like firewalls like

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,580
pfsense mono wall smooth wall things

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,599
like that and I've just kind of trusted

00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,760
that they've known what they were doing

00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,430
until I learned what they were doing and

00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,810
rust way no they don't exactly let's go

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:20,510
and fix this and work on some other

00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:23,530
things but you're in the open network

00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:32,119
don't do it guys just don't do it

00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:44,920
question ssl strip it's a let's see if i

00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:47,500
can do this yes yeah yeah kinda it's a

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,839
essentially what it's doing is in

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:54,170
facebook works brilliantly Twitter

00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:55,580
doesn't which is awesome gmail like

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,470
google services it's a hit or miss

00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,660
sometimes I can actually return the

00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,960
plaintext password sometimes I'll return

00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:07,550
nothing or I will return the passwords

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,890
as its encrypted so but essentially SSL

00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,780
strip what it's doing is I'm the men in

00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:17,119
the middle you initiate an HTTP session

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:19,910
through me I then make that session on

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,520
your behalf to Facebook so I'm actually

00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,839
maintaining that the HTTP session but

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,880
when it gets returned back to you to

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,940
your browser if you look very carefully

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,150
you're now

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,300
on HTTP so I'm actually stripping out

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,310
that the HTTPS on your end but you

00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,680
actually that the full connection is

00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:49,940
making it all the way to Facebook as a

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:52,410
secure connection yes yeah you're sort

00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,510
especially the latest iterations of SS a

00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:56,430
strip your you're not seeing the

00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:59,010
security certificate warnings and all

00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:04,829
this other stuff that it's making it a

00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:06,690
lot more it's really hiding what you're

00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:08,579
doing and that's why we have to be very

00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,530
observant and very persistent with we

00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,880
can't just I have so many people to say

00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:18,690
oh I checked for for the s all the time

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:21,839
no you don't nobody checks for HTTPS all

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:24,150
the time I don't I forget you know or I

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,920
have this little log you know see the

00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:31,230
little lock I have the little lock I own

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,050
that little lock I have the favicon and

00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:36,319
I can send it to you on your HTTP

00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,319
session

00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,630
yeah it is shifted over a little bit but

00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,510
for the average general user how many

00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,350
people's going to notice that and that's

00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:54,870
the thing it's it's about until 802

00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,050
dot11 and these things the standards

00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:00,810
actually get rewritten and we're not

00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:03,090
these issues aren't going to go away so

00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:05,310
how do we how do we deal with that we

00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,360
educate ourselves um how many of you

00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,060
guys knew that these kind of

00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,400
vulnerabilities existed prior to this

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:15,810
tall I've got a good me that's all so

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,270
I'm glad and how many of you are

00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,670
actually actively taking measures right

00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:23,310
now in this talk to prevent these kind

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:26,550
of things not all of you that just raise

00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:29,790
your hand okay see it comes down to

00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,920
education you guys I would hope are

00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:36,780
going to take extra levels of protection

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:42,590
but your wife your kids they're not

00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:46,170
going to do this there's huh yeah yeah

00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:48,090
yeahs different things Neal say that

00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:54,560
company we went back a year later they

00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:54,560
had fixed all those issues so question I

00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:05,340
was taking a class networking class at

00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:10,190
CPCC here in Charlotte required us to

00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:14,550
use wireshark and head us to capture a

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:19,950
little behold I watched my my prop

00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:24,470
account password with my isp flats right

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:26,370
before my very eyes and I attended with

00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:31,690
that

00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:36,280
password in plain texts immediately I

00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:42,310
changed my weapon I found out the ifd is

00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:46,410
time warner cable that doesn't offer any

00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:49,060
way to encrypt your pop account after

00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:53,290
and I don't know how many people are

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:55,450
aware of that yeah you know it so

00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,790
immediately now now all my mail gets

00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:00,580
forwarded to another account that is

00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:05,710
that I do check through ssl you know use

00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:07,870
this as hell for now but just yeah yeah

00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,420
there's some scary and specifically with

00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:11,500
this plan if anybody is interested like

00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,410
I said I'm not going to this is not a

00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,690
how-to session or anything like this

00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:18,700
this device right here it's actually

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,110
called a Wi-Fi pineapple the little

00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:25,240
character you've been seeing is actually

00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:26,890
the logo for this device and it's built

00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,190
on it's running a thrush chipset it's

00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,840
really cool you can actually go to hack

00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,280
five-dollar words organization that

00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,840
built these things they run or about

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,850
ninety nine dollars you can actually

00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,820
bottom yourself flash the firmware if

00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,190
you want to and really play around with

00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,140
this device has so much capabilities I

00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:48,940
talked about the WPS vulnerability

00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:50,770
earlier and the attack are the software

00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,230
to actually brute force that was called

00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:56,290
reaver it was released now about a year

00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:59,230
and a half ago that that divide that

00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,900
technology or that software is I can run

00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,670
it directly from this device so i can

00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:06,540
actually sit here and just go drop this

00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:10,270
off as you can see i'm running on a

00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:12,160
10,000 milliamp battery and i have i

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,410
have several of these and cut their

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,780
running in Pelican cases that I can just

00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:22,540
go and deploy out in public areas has a

00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:26,740
USB port I'm currently use it running on

00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,000
just a four gig USB so that can have yet

00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,580
for you guys you can't see this this is

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,040
the actual device this is just a battery

00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,470
pack but what's really cool about this

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,900
particular device is it supports 3g

00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:41,970
modems yeah so i can plug a 3g modem 4g

00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,930
Oh demented here and I can main a

00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:48,000
persistent SSH tunnel into this device

00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:50,700
wherever it's at so i can actually

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,710
remotely attack you from the comfort of

00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:58,680
my recliner which is very comfortable by

00:47:52,710 --> 00:48:01,549
the way hak5 dot-org hak5 org they've

00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,950
got a great day that's a podcast series

00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:06,150
Darren there in kitchen and Shannon

00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,700
Morse to it they've been going for about

00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:12,990
five or six years now wealth of

00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,730
information all kinds of things they

00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:17,039
actually help develop this the community

00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:19,289
is really big I will give you a note

00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,450
this is classified as a professional

00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:24,510
wireless penetration tool it's not a toy

00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:27,539
I don't use it as a toy I use it as an

00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:30,539
educational device I've had to myself so

00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:32,250
many times with this device because I

00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:34,020
want to figure out what it's doing in MO

00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,549
am I vulnerable I want to protect myself

00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:39,299
I really don't care about you guys as

00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:41,160
much as I do about myself and so but you

00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:44,160
can check this device out you can also

00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,410
check out a karma which is a hostapd you

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:52,140
can run it directly off of anything

00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:55,200
that's an astros chipset I think the 85

00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:58,200
k and 89 k chipsets it'll support it

00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,089
right out of the box so you can actually

00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,770
simulate a lot of these attacks you can

00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:04,049
go download ssl strip you can go

00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,059
download rever you can go download and

00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:07,500
actually do this from from your laptop

00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:10,049
but what's nice about this particular

00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,970
device is it is extremely portable I've

00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:14,910
stuck it up under a coffee table I've

00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:17,190
stuck at all kinds of places stuck it in

00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,470
a metal box with the bellsouth telephone

00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:22,829
sticker on the side of it and stuck it

00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:24,599
on a light pole on a street corner one

00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,619
time in downtown Greenville you should

00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,069
have seen the looks when I'm just

00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:32,670
walking up and staying to get my bag and

00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:36,539
walk off and at that point all I was

00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:39,180
doing is complete transparency for that

00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:41,099
particular session I was just looking at

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,960
all the available networks it around and

00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:45,960
looking at the encryption levels whether

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,260
WPS WPA I was also capturing all the MAC

00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:54,490
addresses so that I could look

00:49:47,260 --> 00:50:03,940
the vendors yes how can test for that is

00:49:54,490 --> 00:50:06,190
your software Oh hidden SSID what well

00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:07,750
it's even if it's not remembered you

00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,300
let's say I mean let's say I'm sitting

00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,790
in your driveway you got a hidden SSID

00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:16,150
do you know what that does to stop me

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:19,540
nothing I don't need your SSID I need

00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:22,360
your mac address which I can see using

00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,770
tools like aircrack-ng that's sweet

00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,840
which is a phenomenal that's where I

00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,000
started I can actually see your access

00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,420
well I don't know what this is ideas but

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I can then start running a different

00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,830
attacks and stuff and doing packet

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,900
injection and the authentication text he

00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:42,250
build enough information that i can now

00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:48,640
authenticate to your network your mac

00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:50,230
addresses idiot it is definitely a

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,080
little bit harder in that case of i

00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:55,150
haven't done a lot against a mac spoofs

00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,190
mac address so i can i'm not going to

00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:01,180
even guesstimate it at the level of

00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:02,740
difficulty but my guess is that it is

00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,110
going to add a layer but i'm not going

00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:08,860
to say that it's gonna I just don't

00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:10,180
believe that it's going to be a any much

00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,570
more of a protection it may slow you

00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:21,690
down a little bit but not a significant

00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:21,690
amount so any other questions yes

00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:30,260
there you go the guest network that I

00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,610
connected well okay in this case the

00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,830
reason why that is is because you're

00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:38,060
actually you're not probing hidden SSID

00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:44,120
you're probing Duke Blue pute blue or

00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:46,430
whatever it was or guest and so I it

00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,190
doesn't matter now I think his questions

00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:51,230
more it's like attacking a to a hidden

00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,600
network where I just I just land in your

00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,080
location do a quick scan see all the

00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,250
networks around and I can't actually see

00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:11,060
everything is broadcasting whether it's

00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:17,270
hidden or not okay uh well that's it

00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:21,620
that's it that's a great question I have

00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:25,700
this really really nice setup called I

00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:31,280
actually have to have a 48 dbi parabolic

00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:35,060
dish as well as a 28 dbi yagi array I

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:38,890
will often go to the mountains outside

00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:43,250
of where I live and be able to reach

00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:46,610
access points up to six miles away line

00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:49,100
of sight yet distance is not a factor if

00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:51,290
I in it but it's all it's all going to

00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,920
be on my end I have to have enough power

00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:59,450
to go to actually get to you one perfect

00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:03,410
thing anybody familiar with alpha alpha

00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:06,110
networks they make a line of USB

00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:08,390
adapters and stuff this is a godsend for

00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:11,020
people like me it supports packet

00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:13,070
injection this is also a 1 watt

00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,350
transmitter which is illegal in the

00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,750
United States by default it operates at

00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:20,300
500 milliwatts which is the SEC

00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:24,260
limitations so naturally I travel to

00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,090
Belize a lot to you know for my

00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,770
exploitations and things because I

00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,200
actually can't get a full one watt out

00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:31,579
of this with and it typically typically

00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,180
use this 9dbi into

00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:38,089
with it and I can see some things that

00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:41,119
are ridiculously far away based off your

00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:44,349
standard adapter and so when you plug a

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,519
yagi adapter into into this and then USB

00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:48,650
it's pretty much game over I can see

00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:52,029
here and go to the bank of america

00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:54,979
building go up on top that would be fine

00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:58,549
you know currently they're not going to

00:53:54,979 --> 00:54:01,249
let me do that unfortunately but yeah

00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:09,170
that had its the possibility any other

00:54:01,249 --> 00:54:13,099
questions comments fears yes well then

00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:16,039
the next steps this first is absolutely

00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:17,029
a first of all check out hak5 org they

00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,619
have a lot of this information

00:54:17,029 --> 00:54:20,660
especially on the forums and stuff like

00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:23,630
that the research these attacks

00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:25,759
firesheep of Wi-Fi pineapple karma

00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:27,319
actually jump down into to the bare

00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:29,029
level of how these things are working

00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:30,920
specific as what i did with the probe

00:54:29,029 --> 00:54:34,400
request because i'm going that's

00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,890
ridiculously cool and ridiculously scary

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,309
I don't want you to never connect to the

00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:41,690
internet because i believe the internet

00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:44,089
is a free system and we should be able

00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,999
to use it freely without fear but

00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:50,150
unfortunately we can't and we probably

00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:52,489
never will be able to so but the biggest

00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:57,380
thing is form some kind of tunneling

00:54:52,489 --> 00:55:01,509
system encryption open VPN pptp ssh do

00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:04,459
something Oh anybody use proxies okay

00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:06,769
prop yeah yeah I had somebody one time

00:55:04,459 --> 00:55:08,150
so I just you always have a proxy in my

00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:10,459
browser so i don't have to worry about

00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,499
that well all that's doing is moving

00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:14,930
your termination point where your

00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:16,089
traffic dumps out on the internet you

00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:20,539
still don't have a level of encryption

00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:23,449
so I can still see Oh going this way so

00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:25,549
I like I use proxies but always use

00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:27,759
proxy like specifically a squid proxy

00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:33,140
and I use that in conjunction with

00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:34,940
openvpn i am not going to answer that

00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,880
question

00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:40,980
pequea thieves genius tour is almost

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,609
impossible to track to us they can find

00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,470
your onion later yep yep and because

00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:49,109
you're right you're rapidly jumping in

00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,480
and every you know and I haven't jumped

00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:53,310
into the to the real fundamentals of how

00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,770
tours working as far as when it's

00:55:53,310 --> 00:56:07,080
deciding to switch and randomized those

00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:10,560
proxies and say like Vietnam a puppet

00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,810
guests enter and then if a onion lawyer

00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,630
finds somebody is trying to watch oh it

00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:18,270
is what Cheech one never knows yeah yeah

00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:26,520
and the so issue that I have with that

00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:29,670
it is just slow but it is secure yeah

00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:32,010
yeah yeah and it's a lot and the other

00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:35,250
is real advantage of like specifically

00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:39,030
openvpn um is that I can run it on port

00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:41,369
443 any IT admins here sis admins

00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:47,160
network admins do you block 443 on your

00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:49,710
network there you go you're at work you

00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,050
I don't you know heaven forbid you

00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,740
actually be you know not productive and

00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:57,810
on facebook or something guess what

00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:00,320
people like them can actually see your

00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:04,350
traffic they can see what you're doing I

00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:06,930
Stu us at SS you know do an SSL session

00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:08,760
back home or to a server somewhere else

00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:12,090
now obviously they also can see a

00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,800
consistent ssl stream well he's been

00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:17,550
connected to the server for a really

00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,290
long time you know but it gives you that

00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,359
going we uh the company i work for us

00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:24,300
about technology we have VPN router

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,920
router appliances all over the world we

00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,950
have a lot of customers in china anybody

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,580
familiar with a great firewall of china

00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:34,950
it is it is difficult they especially

00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:38,910
for a while everybody was using pptp

00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:42,119
only one port 1194 so naturally which i

00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:45,600
was like no they just start today's up

00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:47,040
blocking that port openvpn you pretty

00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,500
much use any ports you want to

00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,240
so and we're actually having to

00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,760
constantly chase the ISPs and the

00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:58,410
government and moving our customers from

00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:00,300
port to port support to stay ahead of of

00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:03,300
what's going on um and they're getting

00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,500
really smart man there they're doing

00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,270
some stuff we're still trying to figure

00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,880
out how they're actually but Thursday

00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:10,940
you know if the sessions are lasting too

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,350
long as hard as they can the continuous

00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:15,140
ssl tunnels they're actually what

00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,950
they'll doing there is they're just

00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:19,200
basically flipping switch on the

00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:21,270
internet for just a few minutes and so

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,310
now you got forced to reconnect and it's

00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:25,980
just and a lot of the VPN server

00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:28,920
providers do this thing where after so

00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:31,530
many failed attempts it just stops so

00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,420
now now unbeknownst to you in a lot of

00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:46,290
cases you're back on local internet

00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:48,090
where China can see you yeah yeah yeah

00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:52,350
there's there's there's things out there

00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:54,270
but it not everybody's going to have

00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:56,370
that we're talking about some serious

00:58:54,270 --> 00:59:00,330
money to do that stuff you know but I

00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:01,350
can also go out of 53 on UDP you know of

00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,300
course that does look a little

00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:05,690
suspicious when you have a bunch of SSL

00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,790
traffic going out what no that's not DNS

00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:11,040
but I can you know I can I can assign it

00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:13,560
any port that I want to so that does

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,360
offer me a level security that that you

00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,420
just typically don't get specifically

00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:22,320
with a like pptp and the other thing

00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:25,920
with against tour is I don't control

00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:29,300
tour I control my server I control my

00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,300
VPN server yes

00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:37,840
from but if you don't already have some

00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:39,609
sort of encryption to begin with they

00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:45,369
can still stiff your passwords and

00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:47,200
anyone can run a texaco anymore no yeah

00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:52,030
any other questions where we're out of

00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:54,700
time unfortunately uh yeah tinfoil hats

00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:56,200
really do work they make people make you

00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,980
look some people stay away from

00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:03,790
you oh but you're the guy I'm going to

00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:06,609
go after because I'm like he's ya hate

01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:11,740
you know but wrap everything up real

01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:16,270
quick be conscious that your security is

01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:18,460
in your control you can make the

01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:20,020
decisions you don't have to trust people

01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,700
I don't encourage you to trust people

01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,770
the very reason that you're not going to

01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,810
give me my credit card you should be

01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:30,340
conscious and you should be concerned

01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:35,050
about how your bank processes things

01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:38,020
it's okay to question things I was with

01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:40,859
a bank for a while that used to actually

01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:43,859
send my statements to my email address

01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:45,910
and i was like i don't like that and

01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:47,410
i've also complained I've always

01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:49,270
complained in a bunch of other people

01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:52,030
down so now it's I get an email says

01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:54,730
your statement is ready click here to

01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:56,290
login and so then I login to the actual

01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,450
banking website and then I can view my

01:00:56,290 --> 01:01:00,040
statement and from there I can download

01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:02,380
it i can print it i can do whatever i

01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,369
want to but it's not being sent to me so

01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:08,320
that if anybody just happens to be in

01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:10,119
inside my email account like oh well

01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,250
he's got this Bank this is you know oh

01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:14,650
this he works for this company because I

01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,270
can see this paycheck and you know you

01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:19,750
can get real scary real fast when you

01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:22,060
start handing over information on open

01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:24,640
networks so I do appreciate you for your

01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:27,990
time I will be out at outside for a few

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,990
minutes if you have any other questions

01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,190
you

01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:43,310
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:45,530
ago we could not have imagined that

01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:47,720
asterisk would not only become the most

01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,880
widely adopted open source communication

01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,890
software on the planet but that it would

01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,410
impact the entire industry in the way

01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:56,420
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:59,030
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:00,980
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:03,080
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,490
transition of power from the hands of

01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,770
the traditional proprietary phone

01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:09,170
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:11,090
administrators of phone systems using

01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:12,320
this power our customers have created

01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:14,270
all sorts of business changing

01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,130
applications from small office phone

01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:18,650
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,240
the international carrier networks in

01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,010
fact there's even an entire country

01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,410
those communications infrastructure runs

01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,540
on esters the gym has always been about

01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:28,250
creating technology that expands

01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,440
communications capabilities in ways that

01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,610
we could never have imagined and that's

01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,010
part of what's game-changing about

01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:36,710
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:38,810
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:40,910
IP phones that extends control of the

01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:42,680
user all the way to the desktop the

01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:44,390
launch of these new products represents

01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,370
the next phase indigenous history of

01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:48,890
innovation these are the first and only

01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:50,600
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,160
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,170
our expectations for building a family

01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,330
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:58,070
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:59,720
the team to build the phones such that

01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,910
they were easy to install integrate

01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,770
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:06,320
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:07,940
that goal user feedback is validating

01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,070
that when it comes to operation with

01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:12,500
astro space systems including our own

01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:15,080
Switchvox based product these are the

01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,370
easiest to use best integrated most

01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,980
interoperable products on the market

01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:20,950
today the digital ear phones will

01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,000
initially include three IP des hommes

01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:24,950
uniquely designed to complement any

01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,810
asterisks or switch box based solution

01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:29,480
these phones are different for a number

01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:32,150
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,560
designed for use with esters secondly

01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,170
we've made it really easy to

01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,580
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:39,260
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,200
to access information inside of

01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:43,200
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,190
between an application and the phone

01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,349
additionally we've created an

01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:49,480
applications engineer that allows users

01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:52,690
and developers to create and run their

01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:54,460
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:56,440
done all of this at a very compelling

01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:58,089
price point at Digium we're always

01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,190
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:03:58,089 --> 01:04:02,770
the best value in business phone systems

01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:04,329
and also give them the power to create

01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:06,460
their own solutions or any

01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:08,200
communications challenge well continue

01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:09,609
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,680
Astra's cooler faster and more

01:04:09,609 --> 01:04:13,300
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,760
asterisk employed communications even

01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:19,230
easier and together we'll change the way

01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,230
the world communication again

01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:31,070
your customers rely on your website or

01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,440
application if it's slower

01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:36,380
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,210
and costs you money keeping your

01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:41,690
business critical systems humming along

01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:44,030
requires insight into what they're doing

01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:45,980
your system metrics tells stories

01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,990
stories that can reveal performance

01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:50,300
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:51,890
other problems but how do you keep an

01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,530
eye on all of your systems performance

01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:57,560
metrics in real-time and record this

01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:59,540
data for later analysis enter longview

01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,340
the new way to see what's really going

01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:03,500
on under the hood the long view

01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,540
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:08,000
of all your systems providing you with a

01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:11,390
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,970
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:15,710
load and network usage click a specific

01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:18,140
system to access its individual

01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:20,650
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:23,030
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,710
comprehensive network data including

01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,020
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:28,610
available on the network tab and disk

01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,500
rights and free space on the disk

01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:33,350
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,900
displays usage statistics for individual

01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:38,060
processes the system info tab shows

01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:40,310
listening services active connections

01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:42,440
and available updates adding long view

01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:44,120
to a system is easy just click the

01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,280
button copy the one line installation

01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:48,710
command then run the command on your

01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,420
linux system to complete the process the

01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,580
agent will begin collecting data and

01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,440
sending it to longview then the graph

01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:57,020
start rolling

01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,390
use longview to gain visibility into

01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:03,130
your servers so when your website or app

01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:03,130
heats up it stays up

01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:49,200
most enterprises today realize that

01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,849
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,220
enough to keep their network safe from

01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:55,290
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:57,329
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:59,460
popular lately that adds that extra

01:06:57,329 --> 01:07:02,130
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:03,900
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:06,089
know is that some two-factor

01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:08,310
authentication solutions they're better

01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:11,339
than others like two-factor strong

01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:13,619
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:15,569
beyond other authentication systems by

01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,660
being less expensive easier to implement

01:07:15,569 --> 01:07:21,119
and easier to use giving software-based

01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,940
token clients built to run on all major

01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,569
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:28,920
Android these tokens utilize a

01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:31,140
public/private key combination that's

01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,270
generated and on device so there aren't

01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:35,790
any shared secrets flying around or

01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:38,640
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:40,500
special handling instead all keys are

01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,990
kept secure and private between the

01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:45,180
requesting token and your server which

01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:46,790
you control in-house making it the most

01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:49,470
secure way possible to perform

01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:52,260
authentication encryption and with an

01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:55,050
extensive flexible API and support for

01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:57,030
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:58,740
works with any enterprise network

01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,920
architecture to protect

two-factor authentication for the first

01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:12,330
time we're just ready to ditch your

01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:14,730
existing expensive key file system we

01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:19,640
can help with easy to implement easy to

01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:19,640
use strong authentication from wicked

01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:31,060
past that sigh every way this is the way

01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:32,920
to better utilize all your resources and

01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:36,370
it makes managing all your resources

01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:40,200
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:43,720
happening in open source the

01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,520
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,650
of the community and the speed at which

01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,630
these are these you know these these

01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:51,970
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:54,790
discovered and then fixed is it I think

01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:57,790
that really shows the power of the of

01:08:54,790 --> 01:09:00,240
the open source community it is global

01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:03,790
and it's definitely because of the users

01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:09,670
community people are extremely friendly

01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:11,470
and always ready to help if you go an

01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:13,660
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:16,330
helping each other out and they're all

01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:18,010
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:21,000
product is transparent for everyone

01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:23,950
everyone can look at the code base

01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,690
everyone can see how close darkest is

01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:31,540
being built nothing nothing is

01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:34,210
proprietary everything is open in many

01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:38,380
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:42,160
ongoing health cloudstack the most

01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:45,980
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:48,710
was our first developer boot camp

01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:51,350
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:55,310
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:59,510
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:09:55,310 --> 01:10:02,330
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:04,850
chairs into the room twice everything

01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:08,210
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:11,180
is open source and so I don't think that

01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:12,920
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:15,980
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:18,680
computing and so i think it's i think

01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:20,030
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,170
about cloud computing you're really

01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:26,690
talking about open source cloud

01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:29,750
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:31,880
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:36,140
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:38,840
in each data center is these hardware is

01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:42,320
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:45,020
to handle number one that mass scale

01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:48,200
number two it's designed to handle the

01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:50,720
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:54,260
deployments started working on college

01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:57,620
attack over four years ago and it was

01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:00,290
the original set of people working on it

01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:04,400
had a background of delivering software

01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:08,630
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:12,260
lots of users actually using it high

01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:15,350
availability is a key feature multiple

01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:17,510
hypervisors support different network

01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:20,510
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:22,280
better well step management server can

01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:25,970
be deployed in different physical

01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:27,650
machines it definitely has a huge

01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:32,630
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:35,210
there's a major movie studio that they

01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:38,510
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:40,489
to transcode video and i thought that

01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:42,140
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:45,410
more fascinating is what they did during

01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:48,200
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:49,369
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,199
lunch was over they would

01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:55,309
all the instances and go back to doing

01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,929
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:11:55,309 --> 01:11:59,030
so many different aspects and there's no

01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:01,399
one person that's kind of like a master

01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:05,510
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:07,729
as a project is going to be one of the

01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:11,780
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:17,239
most feature Folan and and robust

01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:20,139
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:20,139
