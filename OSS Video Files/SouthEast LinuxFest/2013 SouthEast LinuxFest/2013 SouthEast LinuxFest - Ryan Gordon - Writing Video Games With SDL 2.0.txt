emotions it's what I think it is what is

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,850
the library's main framework it's really

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,830

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,590
different shirt the organism from c-bus

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:36,350

Drabek cited problems only on windows

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:47,510

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,880
windows and the next three dfgdf solaris

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,240
and things that become very hungry for

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,650
making it on vertex right like the dream

00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:04,120

do we get Sonya right so incredibly fast

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,180
but it's also very easy to use and

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,819
that's really acid that's the simple

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,789
person

00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:23,550
there is nothing like a night to think

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:29,430

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:44,610
a tenure which was not any of them but

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:47,280
necklace last economic system step back

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,810
but it was really awesome at the time I

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,690
play the macro people in the bar so

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,480
looks awkward accent and because this a

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,970
big leap enormous investment and how am

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,700
I you know creates the only came from

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,790
anchor was thinking doing of games

all day with that money could just you

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,270
know start stretching so we have good

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,830
frame or circle

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:18,230
the facts and we've had it said where

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,020

when we can talk to you extra credit

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:35,960
need to talk it also just make it there

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,750
should be working on a scale only two

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:44,900
we've just known XTL to 10 just knew how

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:55,820
to get early that year development

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:58,790
meetings go on it but most of all over

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,160
Russell them if you have a computer that

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:04,580
has treated should wrap a stick comment

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,150
on this year at home hot chocolate we

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:12,490
have you know you know be operated yes

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:16,900
sir the dreamcast playstation home

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:20,530
already make all right and I think

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,479
point where we focused the

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,940
cross-platform person person only

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,789
talking windows in a question is every

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,590
most definitely stop the CL almost

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,990
universally the teams are just compile

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:45,690
and run on button piercing portage

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:48,699
redbox this only what that means is that

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,500
anyone ever tried to use amazing to get

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,389
like you know music player to play

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,169
that's probably experienced in 20 years

00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:58,389
where one date work with / def DFC and

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,280
then the next thing that you Merman also

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,130
was there and you talk also if you have

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,350
a sound then one day the offices and I

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,870
talked to the pulse beauty and if you

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,090
talk to the pulse of a tract also civil

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,060
selection across a triple saga which

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,710
under that issue dated and for the

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,350
window shop

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,960
the next great things they say that we

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,170
can for SEL that you can never change so

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:27,480
worst case you need to be shifting 90s

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:30,730
that still are fun with Lucien SEO yo yo

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,870
the waiting toxic kernels make a noise

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:37,240
maker Sean currently has changed in that

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:40,440
fight it dropping us yeah just a side

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:46,780

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,520
because you said then you're stronger

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,750
the extra messilissa for you we're about

00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:05,530
how to surf comp wait and mirror and

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:08,320

separate libraries of SEO unique option

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:41,230
if you want that one that are not very

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:45,310
program to knowing and this issue you

know higher level mix to load graphic

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:52,060
Democrats if you look sound formats that

00:12:48,700 --> 00:13:00,250
still together dropshipping on text into

00:12:52,060 --> 00:13:04,950
your graphics I music actually could

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,950
achieve pc gabion necklace and usually

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:14,320
so as lesson else prematurely yes talk

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:19,830
to you later so but other than Americans

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,830

ok we have players ever to

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:44,110
really these are the things we're

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,750
focusing on these are not all the most

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:50,050
of our own sport but there is no greater

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,730
honor than a charger is that also means

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,470
a lot more or less BS in solaris and all

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,290
those berries therefore we need to do

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,690
that setback best Madison supported

00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:22,309
event in this is a crazy press

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:24,590
and then brainer it's either way you

00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:27,349
asked for access is not there simply i

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,659

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:39,320
twist it like this is the new decreases

00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:42,049
our luck so either way to say like how

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,299
many bums jessica you know what are the

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:47,479
metrics take out this joystick so that

00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:49,059
we do smart things it says be right well

00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:51,039
the first step

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:59,830
because that never were on next add

00:28:51,039 --> 00:29:02,110

each other like that so that's what

00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:22,389
that's all good now the compound this is

00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,909
a new jersey shore lump and there's

00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:27,970

00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:30,190
shop and they have decided that on the

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,830
Xbox box you have an xbox controller but

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,139
they were thinking on reduced also have

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,269
next option trouble so you may have seen

00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,190
a window scene at some point we're using

00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:43,929
through a mouse keyboard it's a press

00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:46,450
degree the 18 continuous is a Comanche

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:50,490
boxing and I've chosen a guy who is now

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:54,820
x english toffee reviews with dx11 enjoy

00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:56,950
but what it does is basically says it's

00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,690
just a control me guided all it does is

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,090
handle tech

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:04,379
one choice all those new years obstacle

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:06,840
this only thing does but what we found

00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:11,759
to keep our store in embracing at home

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,470
videos much of my frustration so

00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,850
everyone's next auction for that

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:20,789
exercise but then I say that is so is

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,980
that what they found was that talks

00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:25,529
important that everyone wants to know so

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:32,220
basic to stop the jury could use me to

00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:34,559
that so what we said before again which

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,259
is kind of your speaker that's not sure

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,470
it assumes you have xbox controller

00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:42,899
bridges said something close to that

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,450

controls of that everything the man hats

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:52,440

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,419
everything about receive a picture so

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,700

00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:17,830
terrified the usual Joker 331 copy

00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:25,110
ballgame you can imagine why people use

00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:28,240
everything simple truth seekers 7s up

00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:32,640
and right now you're sick seekers

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,640
detection of our teams have done

00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:41,940
weightless come up so to the xserver I

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:47,520

cookies unified just have all these

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:18,410
weird little fun linux embedded devices

00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,960
are also working so cool hey I want a

wrong and but we like to get wrong about

00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,370
this we're willing a little ever do plus

social we're going eventually when you

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,170
see until over to binary distribution

00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,950
program is just there's a friend of hot

00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,490
to even go and if you request air which

number

00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:19,100
you say how you look super bedridden or

feature on our trading platforms to cook

00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:27,170
for this thing you hear about our

madness hears anything wallet develops

00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,670
which is great old people were extra

00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:35,840
being overs at Triple A game companies

00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:38,270
and lamb never compiler and I don't say

00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:41,240
that exactly traders this and learn

00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:43,210
about I've sexy on you go to if that's a

00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,090
stupid question you still in the ditch

00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:50,780
which is not true in many places we're

00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:59,600
trying to curb this your new day

00:44:50,780 --> 00:45:04,300
tomorrow this the alarm sameera male

children family they go back and forth

00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:12,260
there lately which is incredibly good

documentation for emerging best novels

00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,760
85 completely are very aggressive

00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:19,340
alchemy and obfuscate includes with you

00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,990
breaking the API trying to finalize stl

00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,990
to just everyday

00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:03,619
ok so that's all the talk we have

00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:08,869
precious have taken that was it we have

00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:11,570
a 14 if you're going to hire exactly I'm

00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:14,900
here I'm he'll do you find these slides

00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,640
at yourself 2013 that's my email address

00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:20,330
you'll stink of support from your

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:29,180
business into this that's on google+

00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:46,460
music shorter days right so that's my

00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:51,130
god any questions yes yes yes we can go

00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,130
to the top but to the Mon Calamari haha

00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:20,589
both like software so pretty that's good

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,240
tool to handle which is just a

00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,820
collection of nitrogen

00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:49,660
regional library including SNL many

00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:49,660
sizes easier you all right

00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:45,450
most enterprises today realize that

00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:47,160
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,530
enough to keep their network safe from

00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,600
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:53,640
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,770
popular lately that adds that extra

00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,440
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,210
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,400
know is that some two-factor

00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:04,620
authentication solutions they're better

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,680
than others like two-factor strong

00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:09,930
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,910
beyond other authentication systems by

00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,970
being less expensive easier to implement

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:17,430
and easier to use giving software-based

00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:20,280
token clients built to run on all major

00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:22,880
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,230
Android these tokens utilize a

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,630
public/private key combination that's

00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:29,580
generated on device so there aren't any

00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,100
shared secrets flying around or

00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,980
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,840
special handling instead all keys are

00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,300
kept secure and private between the

00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,490
requesting token and your server which

00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,100
you control in house making it the most

00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,780
secure way possible to perform

00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:48,570
authentication encryption and with an

00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,360
extensive flexible API and support for

00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:53,340
protocols like ldap and radius wicked

00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,000
works with any enterprise network

application if it's slower

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:26,740
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,570
and costs you money keeping your

business critical systems humming along

00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:34,400
requires insight into what they're doing

00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:36,349
your system metrics tells stories

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,359
stories that can reveal performance

00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,670
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:42,259
other problems but how do you keep an

00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,900
eye on all of your systems performance

00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:47,930
metrics in real-time and record this

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,670
data for later analysis enter longview

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,709
the new way to see what's really going

00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,869
on under the hood the long view

00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:55,939
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:58,369
of all your systems providing you with a

00:50:55,939 --> 00:51:01,759
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:04,339
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,079
load and network usage click a specific

00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:08,509
system to access its individual

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,019
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:51:08,509 --> 00:51:13,400
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:15,079
comprehensive network data including

00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,390
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:18,979
available on the network tab and disk

00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,869
rights and free space on the disk

00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:23,719
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:26,269
displays usage statistics for individual

00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:28,430
processes the system info tab shows

00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:30,680
listening services active connections

00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:32,809
and available updates adding long view

00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,489
to a system is easy just click the

00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:36,650
button copy the one line installation

00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:39,079
command then run the command on your

00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,789
linux system to complete the process the

00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,949
agent will begin collecting data and

00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:44,839
sending it to longview then the graph

00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:47,390
start rolling

00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:49,759
use longview to gain visibility into

00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:53,499
your servers so when your website or app

00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:53,499
heats up it stays up

00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,739
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,690
ago we could not have imagined that

00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:05,910
asterisk would not only become the most

00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,039
widely adopted open source communication

00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:10,079
software on the planet but that it would

00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:12,599
impact the entire industry in the way

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,579
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,219
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:19,170
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,239
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,650
transition of power from the hands of

00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:24,930
the traditional proprietary phone

00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:27,329
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,279
administrators of phone systems using

00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:30,509
this power our customers have created

00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,430
all sorts of business changing

00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:34,289
applications from small office phone

00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,779
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:38,400
the international carrier networks in

00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:40,200
fact there's even an entire country

00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,569
those communications infrastructure runs

00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,729
on esters the gym has always been about

00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:46,440
creating technology that expands

00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:48,599
communications capabilities in ways that

00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,799
we could never have imagined and that's

00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,200
part of what's game-changing about

00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:54,900
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,969
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,099
IP phones that extends control of the

00:52:56,969 --> 00:53:00,839
user all the way to the desktop the

00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,549
launch of these new products represents

00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,559
the next phase indigenous history of

00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:07,049
innovation these are the first and only

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,430
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:10,079
power of esther's when we first

00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,729
discussed our expectations for building

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,339
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:16,140
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:17,880
asked the team to build the phones such

00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,099
that they were easy to install integrate

00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,930
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:24,509
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,130
that goal user feedback is validating

00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:28,229
that when it comes to operation with

00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,660
astro space systems including our own

00:53:28,229 --> 00:53:33,239
Switchvox based product these are the

00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,529
easiest to use best integrated most

00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,140
interoperable products on the market

00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:39,109
today the Digium family of phones will

00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,219
initially include three IP des hommes

00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:43,109
uniquely designed to complement any

00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,999
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:47,670
these phones are different for a number

00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:50,309
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,749
designed for use with esters secondly

00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,359
we've made it really easy to

00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:55,739
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,839
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:59,400
to access information inside of asterisk

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,400
allowing tight coupling

00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,359
between an application and the phone

00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,520
additionally we've created an

00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,650
applications engine that allows users

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,230
and developers to create and run their

00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:12,299
own apps on the following and finally

00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,369
we've done all of this at a very

00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:16,049
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:17,819
always thinking of ways to give our

00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:20,220
customers the best value in business

00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:22,079
phone systems and also give them the

00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,240
power to create their own solutions or

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,039
any communications challenge well

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,809
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:29,849
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:31,470
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:33,930
asterisk and what communications even

00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:37,069
easier and together we'll change the way

00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,069
the world communication again

00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:54,870
house that's the every way this is the

00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:57,060
way to better utilize all your resources

00:54:54,870 --> 00:55:00,510
and it makes managing all your resources

00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:04,340
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:07,860
happening in open source the

00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:09,630
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,580
of the community and then the speed at

00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,470
which these are these you know these

00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,630
these deficiencies these bugs are

00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:18,000
getting discovered and then fixed is it

00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:19,440
I think that really shows the power of

00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,200
the you know of the open source

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,350
community it is global and it's

00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,900
definitely because of the users

00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:33,540
community people are extremely friendly

00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:35,430
and they're always ready to help if you

00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,710
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:39,440
guys helping each other out and they're

00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:42,150
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:45,140
the product is transparent for everyone

00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:48,360
everyone can look at the code base

00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,540
everyone can see how close duck is being

00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:56,070
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:58,650
everything is open in many ways it's

00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:03,150
absolutely vital to the the unborn

00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:07,350
health cloudstack the most exciting

00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:10,140
event in recent memory for me was our

00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:12,839
first developer boot camp

00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:15,480
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:19,349
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:23,609
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:26,460
up with 87 people and had to go get more

00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:28,980
chairs in the room twice everything

00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:32,220
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:35,309
is open source and so I don't think that

00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:37,049
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:40,079
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:42,630
computing and so i think it's i think

00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,160
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,269
about cloud computing you're really

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:50,819
talking about open source cloud

00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:53,970
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:56,369
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:56:53,970 --> 00:57:00,269
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:56:56,369 --> 00:57:02,940
each data centers these hardware is

00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:06,420
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:09,150
to handle number one that mass scale

00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:12,299
number two it's designed to handle the

00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:15,150
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:19,380
deployments started working on cod tech

00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:22,650
over four years ago and it was the

00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,420
original set of people working on it had

00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:28,529
a background of delivering software

00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:32,759
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:36,390
lots of users actually using it high

00:57:32,759 --> 00:57:39,450
availability is the key feature multiple

00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:41,640
hypervisors support different network

00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:44,640
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,410
better while step management server can

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,099
be deployed in different physical

00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:51,750
machines it definitely has a huge

00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:56,789
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:59,339
there's a major movie studio that they

00:57:56,789 --> 00:58:02,640
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:04,619
to transcode video and I thought that

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,240
was terribly fascinating what I found

00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:09,509
more fascinating is what they did during

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,299
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:13,500
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:15,300
lunch was over they would

00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,440
all the instances and go back to doing

00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:21,060
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,160
so many different aspects and there's no

00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:25,530
one person that's kind of like a master

00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:29,640
of all those realms I think clouds stack

00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:31,860
as a project is going to be one of the

00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:35,910
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:41,340
most feature fallen and and robust

00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:44,270
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,270
