00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
would like to thank the following

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,300
diamond sponsors in 2013 for helping

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,029
make these videos possible Oh welcome my

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,430
name is Derrick Carter this is Acme a

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:38,399
user interface for programmers a little

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,210
bit about myself I am a infrastructure

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,230
consultant I do Linux consulting

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,230
bringing up your basic infrastructure

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,559
installation servers configuration

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,629
management so on and so forth if you

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,059
have needs with help with that conv see

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,980
me afterwards you can also contact me

of me you can sometime before the end of

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,439
the day this presentation goose Bach

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,479
comm will be live with a copy of this

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,830
presentation in its full form so you

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,780
have all the sources of everything we've

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:28,500
talked about and and everything else so

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,280
let's start by asking what is acne it's

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,520
a it's a user interface okay isn't it

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:42,360
just an editor not entirely well then

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,829
it's an IDE not entirely a user

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,110
interface I'll get to that in just a

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:51,210
minute it's we got to do a little

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,030
history here Acme is the editor from the

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,500
plan 9 from Bell Labs distribution

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,950
editor slash shell slap user interface

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,149
is what the the actual man page or paper

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,840
that this describes acne is entitled

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:11,580
what is plan 9 well plan 9 is best

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,390
described by its motto

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,030
you knew Cerebus oops

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:21,700
oona core of the unix's most unix-like

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,310
it is the successor to Unix written by

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,680
Bell Labs and it took those paradigms

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,959
that UNIX started you know everything's

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,300
a file plain text do one thing well

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,670
those sorts of things to its logical end

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:41,950
write it that they took the things that

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:45,430
UNIX couldn't quite accomplish and it

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:49,380
essentially boiled down to UNIX is a 60s

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:53,890
style technology that we've kind of just

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,320
made you know iteratively better until

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,640
we get to today and we've got Linux and

00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,560
UNIX and there's been awesome stuff done

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,790
with that but it's still based on those

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:08,290
philosophies from the 60s so the people

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:12,540
who wrote UNIX they said well here we

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:19,380
are at 1990 we have new hardware we have

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:22,360
new baselines of things we can deal with

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:27,250
what if we were to reinvent UNIX today

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,820
and they use the same things everything

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,150
is a file

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,690
but in plan nine literally everything is

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,959
a file

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,030
there's no longer services or things

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,769
that are hidden behind black boxes if

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:46,299
you wanted to create a new TCP session

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:48,850
you go into a directory that's slash net

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:53,019
slash tcp slash new and that will create

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,150
a new TCP session everything is done

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,560
with files why am I telling you this

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,209
it's important to know how to control

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,209
Acme and we're gonna get into that later

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:13,150
that being said plan nine and therefore

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:17,650
by association Acme is a giant paradigm

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,370
shift if your synapses aren't burnin by

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,370
the end of this talk

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,160
you will probably weren't paying

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,080
attention and you'll go oh that's

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,790
interesting oh I think I get it I think

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,620
I get it you

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,340
this example we've all seen the learning

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:40,230
curve diagrams right so here's the the

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,760
learning curve for Nano you learn what

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,740
the commands are or what that little

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,180
caret means at the bottom of the screen

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,670
and voila you've mastered Nano you look

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,610
at them and the vim learning curve looks

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,960
somewhat like this alright so I learned

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,810
a new trick I learned a new trick of

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,760
acne if you're familiar with plan 9 or

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,860
you like the UNIX idea of doing things

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,120
and you want to learn some of the the

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,150
plan 9x tools there's a a project called

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,470
plan nineport

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,190
so plan 9 port or p9p as it's known is

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,480
the userland

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,510
from plan 9 ported to Mac Linux and I

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,780
think Windows I'm not certain on Windows

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:28,980
but it's it's a port of the user space

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,530
tools from plan 9 which include acne and

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,729
there's another one called the acne

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:40,620
stand-alone standalone concept

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:43,590
stand-alone what's that now stand alone

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,180
complex yes stand alone complex which is

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:51,919
a fully packaged acne and the

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,919
environment with which it needs to run

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:59,390
with acne there's a couple of things you

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:03,780
need to keep in mind everything is text

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:06,750
everything is a file that is important

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,400
and we'll see why a little later let's

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,400
look at what acne looks like

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:18,180
so this is the Acme window if you open

00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:19,740
it up in a directory you run the Acme

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,719
command you're gonna get something

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,789
similar to this you're gonna get two

00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:25,789
columns you're gonna get a header row

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,990
the color scheme has been determined

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,990
using science

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,699
there's no opinions in it the interface

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,979
is very minimalistic but the user

00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,240
interface for plan nine was done

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,509
scientifically using which color looks

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,879
better

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,150
a or B which font looks better a or B

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:59,159
and surveyed I don't know how many

00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:02,460
people but what I'm trying to get at is

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:04,560
if you want to customize this to make it

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,409
your own you're going to be editing the

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,599
source code there is no a car seed

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,490
directory that lets you fiddle with the

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,810
background color of this and the font of

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:18,560
that you can choose a font but you're

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,240
not gonna get to change the way it looks

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,469
because it's it's it's a scientifically

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,669
it's I think of it as the way that Steve

00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:29,129
Jobs thinks about how you should use

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:30,180
your hardware the developer for that can

00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,149
you think that that's how you should use

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,500
an editor all right so I'm going to

00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:40,919
force you to use it this way because

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:44,310
trust me it is better question what we

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,139
are looking at now is the plan nineport

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,319
version so I'm running plan nine port

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,199
under mac OS and it's running full

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,659
screen so this is a the question of what

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,680
we're looking at this is Acme running

00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:57,680
under plan nine port

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,439
no it just runs as user space so it's

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,370
it's you you it's a part of the user

00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:09,400
space tools and then the backend there's

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,319
a shim layer that that plan nine port

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,240
uses to communicate with the kernel

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,639
layer of your appropriate hopper

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,469
operating system so you compile it for

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:24,340
your platform but if this is it

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:26,439
we have a file browser quote-unquote in

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,460
this window and the reason we can tell

00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,229
it's a file browser is that the

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,810
beginning which tells us the file name

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:39,700
ends in a slash so if it's a directory

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:43,240
file name this is the directory then we

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,850
have a couple of commands these commands

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,680
cannot be edited anything after the pipe

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,290
however can be we'll get into how to do

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,970
that in just a minute and then you have

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,070
the actual content so this is the

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,990
content of the directory bla bla bla bla

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,670
bla

00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,820
this is the column header with a bunch

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,850
of commands and here's an empty column

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,920
with an empty buffer or actually here

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:13,300
isn't well yes it is an empty an empty

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:15,940
buffer I can type stuff here hi this is

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,670
cool if I wanted to save it I actually

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,089
have to enter the commands into the tag

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:28,329
is what it's called this is the tag and

00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:30,579
I do that by creating a file name such

00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:33,839
as well I'm just gonna copy and paste

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,839
this directory real quick

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:45,250
and I'm gonna give it a file name of

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:47,350
food txt and so this is the file name

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,019
that I want it to have and I'm going to

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,410
execute the command put which is save

00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:56,740
and now if I go over here and execute

00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:00,010
the command git which says load the

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:06,660
directory I get the file to drop into

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,660
that directory that's the basics of Acme

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,700
so it's a it's a text editor there's no

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:20,710
syntax highlighting there's there's no

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:23,390
spell checker there's a save open/close

00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,460
exit that's all the Acne gives you out

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,980
of the box anything else you want to

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,620
build you can build it yourself but

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:36,230
lucky for us it's just UNIX pipes and we

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:38,540
can do all sorts of fun stuff with it a

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:44,200
couple other little pieces here these

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:46,670
little boxes will let you let me open a

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,040
couple other windows here so I can open

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,220
multiple files and it uses a tiling

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,440
paradigm these little boxes here let me

00:10:52,220 --> 00:11:01,280
control how big things are I can hide it

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:06,890
by clicking different mouse buttons and

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:10,010
bring it back I can move it from side to

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:14,410
side see I can do all sorts of fun stuff

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:14,410
like that but yeah that's the basics

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:25,210
one thing about what I'm doing you're

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,590
gonna want a three button Mouse and

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,350
preferably a three button Mouse that has

00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:35,540
a button that is not also the scroll

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:39,490
wheel hard to come by and oh that is

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:42,320
very very washed out this is a Lenovo

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,140
Intelli point mouse I don't remember the

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,210
name I'll modify this slide with a link

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:53,630
to the Amazon entry for it it's 25 bucks

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:55,160
or something it's it's if you're going

00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:01,540
to get into Acme you're gonna want this

00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:04,790
mouse it Scrolls X&Y and the buttons

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,540
this is probably a little easier see the

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,360
buttons are one two three at the top and

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,440
then the scroll points in the middle

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,300
very very cool

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,600
there's a couple of guys that I know

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,720
that actually have some track balls that

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,340
work very well as well so the the thing

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,940
is is that the trackball has three

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,260
buttons and the pointer and a scroll

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,180
mechanism I don't know how he does it

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,160
but there's another one that's really

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,740
good with that

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,650
button clicks so you saw me doing a

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,180
couple of things button one is the left

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,700
button by default it just places the

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,520
cursor button two is the middle button

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:48,080
and it does a little bit of double duty

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,870
but most often it's for executing so

00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:56,750
when I get in here and I want to save

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:58,160
the file you'll notice that it doesn't

00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,480
have anything for me to save it yet

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,240
because it doesn't say put right there

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,340
but if I modify the buffer two things

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,550
happen this little block turns purple

00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:11,140
but it says it's a dirty buffer and then

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,990
it puts the put command into the tag I

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,260
put my mouse over the put command which

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,380
is just Unicode text there's nothing

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,920
fancy about anything it's the the fact

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,940
that the command is capital P UT makes

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,220
Acme do the put operation on the buffer

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,670
so I click the middle button or button

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,640
to

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,140
and that executes the put command it is

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,970
no longer a dirty buffer so it no longer

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,650
needs the foot command in the tag and

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:46,700
it's no longer dirty on the little icon

00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:48,500
in the corner button 3 this is an

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,080
introduction to Acme and we don't have

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:57,140
two weeks so I'm just going to tell you

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,640
that it does stuff and this the magic of

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,460
button 3 is when you're just coming

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,170
around and getting the momentum back

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,790
from that that learning curve when

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,800
you're swooping back around is when you

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:11,600
learn the the magic of button 3 and

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,460
honestly this finger right here knows

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,790
more than this about what button 3 does

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,040
I can't explain it but I can do it when

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,670
I need it to happen so we're just gonna

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,150
hand wave that away for a second and say

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,470
that button 3 does stuff most often it's

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,130
known as plumbing we'll get into what

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:34,520
plumbing isn't just a second Mouse cords

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:39,680
this is the thing that's gonna fry your

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,910
brain and watching an acme guru just fly

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,350
through the screen double-clicking

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,070
triple clicking click click click and

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,380
button cords there is no cut and paste

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:53,540
there is no copy and paste really in

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:56,300
acne without using cording so in order

00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:11,120
to do a copy and paste you need to do

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:14,390
the following I drag button 1 and I do

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,530
not let go of it so I have button 1

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:23,360
depressed I press button 2 that is a cut

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:28,120
I have not let go of button 1 I then

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:33,940
press button 3 and it pastes what was

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:39,290
snarf does the command they use back and

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:41,690
then I let go of button 1 and I have the

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:44,540
ability to reposition my cursor and to

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,470
paste I press button 1 to position my

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,230
cursor

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:54,380
and I press button three to paste again

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,720
button one is left button two is middle

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,150
button three is right Mouse porting

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:05,510
that's your first Mouse cord is a copy

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:08,270
and paste advanced Mouse courting

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,920
honestly I don't quite understand it

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,170
myself

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,210
all I know is it does some really cool

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:20,750
stuff there's a two plus one swipe three

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:24,290
there's you know just it does Rallo

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:27,200
radical magical stuff there's one that

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,420
does execute this wherever it happens to

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,420
be there's another one that does plum

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,850
this whatever happens to be I'm gonna

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,450
get into plumbing just a second and you

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,720
can plumb and or execute with options if

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:45,170
you do it a different way which I still

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,830
kind of don't understand it myself I'm

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:51,080
hoping that I will sometime soon so I

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:55,190
can explain it to people because it does

00:16:51,080 --> 00:17:04,690
make your day go a little faster so

00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:04,690
let's talk about plumbing I want you to

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,930
think of a time that you've been editing

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,780
a file who here's been editing a file

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,650
say a program or something and they run

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:22,300
make and GCC or whatever it is

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:26,360
spits out a there's an air online block

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:29,570
anyone seen that right what do you have

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,640
to usually do once you see that you go

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,650
back to your editor you run the editors

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,240
command whatever that happens to be to

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:43,130
get you to that line and it causes you

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,840
all sorts of grief let me show you here

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:50,710
one little trick of what plumbing does

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,710
and it's it's really

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:14,170
I'm gonna just create a this see here

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:19,400
echo this is line one echo this is mine

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:22,000
too and then so we've got one two three

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:30,290
four five six seven

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,880
echo dollar sign zero :

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:36,880
one two three four five six seven seven

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:52,159
and then I will do another echo hi going

00:18:47,779 --> 00:19:04,820
to put this I'm going to go over here to

00:18:52,159 --> 00:19:09,980
my terminal it works right so whatever

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:13,909
our output would be I can copy and paste

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:17,330
this or go into my editor and try to

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:22,039
figure out how to get to line seven but

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:25,700
really what I want to do is I want to

00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:30,259
have a terminal over here so that I can

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:33,710
run it under acne so what I do is I run

00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:35,299
the command win wherever I want to put

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,690
it I can put it here I can put it here I

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:42,139
can put it here I'm gonna put up here

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:48,070
type it in Wi n middle click to execute

00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:53,090
it and what that does is it puts a

00:19:48,070 --> 00:20:01,279
prompt a shell inside my editor so I can

00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:05,019
do SH example dot sh it does the output

00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,549
and because I have the plumber running I

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:13,369
button three click or right click on

00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:15,379
this do you see what happened there so

00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,539
here I am I'm let's say I highlight this

00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:23,299
line I go back to my output and I

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:27,080
right-click on example dot SH : seven it

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:35,690
moves my mouse from here to here and

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:38,570
selects the entire line slick no very

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:43,700
slick that's not all but wait there's

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:50,929
more you can also plumb with regular

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:54,510
expressions so let's look at that let me

00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:57,930
just go over here and do

00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:08,410
example that SH :

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:10,770
carrot line of course it's gonna find it

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:15,070
there but if I do it this way or

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:21,760
actually let me do this is large so I

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:29,800
have a yes I do need to press push thank

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:34,930
you see what happened there

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:37,720
I can I can essentially create a link to

00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,810
a certain point in my file by using a

00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,470
regular expression

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:46,000
plumbing event so I can link to a

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,230
certain position in a file just by

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,500
specifying : carrot regular expression

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:57,190
very slick here's another one I'm

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,840
curious about Acme itself and I know

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,730
that there's two different Acme man

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,370
pages there's an acme man page that's

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,590
the description of how to execute it and

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,170
there's an acme man page that talks

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,900
about the philosophy of acne so if I

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,850
type acne colon or you know and input

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,530
inside parentheses for which is the the

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,540
you know the syntax of used section four

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:22,630
of the manual if I right-click on that

00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:30,520
it pops open in a new buffer the Acme

00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:32,860
man page now plumbing is something that

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,320
you can do and basically you tell it a

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:39,090
list of rules if you see this string do

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,320
that you write your own rules in text

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:45,760
you can make it do whatever you want

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:50,430
I made it open PDF files in preview if

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,710
I'm on Mac and in events if I'm on Linux

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:57,190
so I make I've got a different plumbing

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:59,380
rule set if I'm on with a Mac as opposed

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,690
to the plumbing rule set if I'm on Linux

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,620
and if I see a PDF and I right click on

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,560
PDF on food out PDF it opens it in the

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,660
appropriate application

00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,870
it's pretty slick you can go a lot

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,620
further with this like URLs get opened

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:19,400
on your web browser etc etc so a lot of

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:25,540
cool stuff there I'm gonna execute Dell

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:29,830
on a couple of these just so that I can

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,830
clean my screen up a wee bit

00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:38,059
all right you're welcome to leave

00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:45,709
hope you can take some time and look at

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:50,690
it a little later let's go a little

00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:52,849
further along now and talk about win

00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:56,349
well I just mentioned win so right it's

00:23:52,849 --> 00:24:02,479
a it's a buffer the downside to win is

00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:04,940
that Acme does not have any idea how to

00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:09,889
do character or excuse me terminal

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:14,839
control codes so the fancy color prompts

00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:17,179
that you're doing the fancy less - -

00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:20,749
color they're gonna fill your screen

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:23,089
with gobbledygook so what you need to do

00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:27,289
is you need to create a special if

00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:29,929
terminal equals nine term make sure

00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:32,119
everything does not do color I've got

00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,679
these in my dot files unfortunately

00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,749
they're not yet in my dot files repo

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,940
I'll get them in there this weekend or

00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:39,559
this next week and it'll be in this

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,149
presentation the link to it so when you

00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,429
get to the goose bucket our presentation

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,440
dokdo's be calm you'll have a link to

00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:46,639
those if you want it so basically what I

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,789
do is I go through and any command that

00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:53,029
I use regularly I create an alias for it

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,799
- the no color option makes it a little

00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:59,119
cleaner and I also modify the output of

00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,820
grep to be plumb friendly if you use the

00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,889
plan nine port version of grep it's done

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,109
automatically but I use the the Mac OS

00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:07,479
version of graft which it uses a space

00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:10,539
between the colon and the name and I

00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:14,299
suck that space up so that I get the the

00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,739
the line number that's plumb friendly so

00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,450
I can plumb through grep and and you

00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:20,079
know run graph in my win and right click

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:23,269
and boom it's ready to roll

00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,759
so it's a shell running in a buffer very

00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:30,109
fun stuff it allows you to do things

00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:32,629
such as sending so instead of typing out

00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:34,489
in a big long command you can it's a

00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:39,940
middle click I believe that does send

00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:42,309
inside of Windows but that's advanced

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,929
again acne is a programmers interface

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,190
what does this mean it means that we can

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:50,419
manipulate

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:58,970
me by using file manipulation so let's

00:25:50,419 --> 00:26:02,090
go back to our thing again going back to

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,909
plan nine plan nine is a network

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,580
agnostic file system everything in plan

00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:12,049
nine every file activity happens over a

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:15,139
protocol called 9p or 92,000 to be a

00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,570
specific even if it's local or remote

00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:19,340
what that means is that you don't know

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,769
if your file is on this machine or

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,480
halfway across the country its network

00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:27,080
agnostic it's a distributed environment

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,029
as a matter of fact your CPU may be

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,279
different than your disk in this

00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,440
directory than in the other so if you go

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,779
into another directory or another

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,929
namespace you may be in a different

00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:43,220
machine or a different file server so

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:46,460
that being said if we get into the the

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,440
interface behind Acme the Acme namespace

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,519
is what it's called it's a bunch of

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:56,539
files I've actually used 9p fuse the the

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:59,600
file systems for user space on Mac to

00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:02,269
mount the Acme namespace under /mnt

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,289
slash Acme there's a couple of bugs so

00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:09,379
you're gonna see some oddities here but

00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:12,200
you're gonna see that there's a a simple

00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:15,350
little directory structure you've got a

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,070
directory with a number in it a bunch of

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:27,950
numbered directories each of those

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:31,070
corresponds to one of these buffers if I

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:39,759
want to create a new buffer let's bring

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:39,759
our window over here CD /mnt slash Acme

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,929
like a lit a little bit easier to see

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:57,309
there we go

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:57,309
watch what happens when I go into new

00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,980
actually let's

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:28,769
let's clean up a little bit so you can

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:36,809
see exactly what this is doing alright

00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:41,789
so we have just the terminal here let's

00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:45,809
scroll down just a bit I'm in /mnt slash

00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:47,399
acne there's only the window nine left

00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:52,970
as I closed all those other buffers

00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:52,970
right if I go into new

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:09,730
and redirect it to the body it's

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,200
supposed to be creating me a new window

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,440
for some reason that doesn't seem to be

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,440
working

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,890
all right this is a cab this is one of

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:31,400
those bugs that I mentioned with the

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,780
using the 9p fuse there's a bugs in the

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,050
fuse interface and so that's what's

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:45,320
causing us grief I'm gonna just use 9p

00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:53,330
directly 9 pls Acme 9 pls act or

00:29:45,320 --> 00:30:03,250
actually 9 P right echo hi pipe it

00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:06,520
through 9 P right to Acme new body and

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,470
that pulls up on a new window just by

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,170
putting file into a pseudo file that

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,780
that new directory doesn't really exist

00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,960
but when it does it puts it in here so

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,550
echo hi 9p right Acme new body

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,850
put the string high into the body of

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,710
this newly created window and the file

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,680
descriptor for that new when you go into

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,720
that directory is the new window id of

00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,710
whatever you're using so the inode for

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,480
that you can use again to do things just

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,370
some really cool crazy stuff you can do

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,550
with this so you can imagine the fun you

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,550
can have

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:52,310
let's do 9 pls Acme and there's a window

00:30:49,550 --> 00:31:01,330
12 so that was the new window we created

00:30:52,310 --> 00:31:09,200
nine pls Acme 12 and I want to do 9p

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:19,160
read Acme 12 oops I did not mean to do

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:22,070
it that way 9p read Acme 12

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,950
tag is what I wanted and you're gonna

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:30,260
see that it says 9p Dell Dell Snarf's

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:38,770
undo put look let's try this let's do

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:47,090
Echo a tag to pipe 9p right

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:49,010
Acme 12 tag that puts a new command this

00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:52,010
is actually a script that I've written

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,330
that's in my path called a tag and the

00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,610
link to it is a little later on the

00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,570
presentation so it's a script that I've

00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:01,430
written that knows about acnes namespace

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:04,700
this script is actually a tool that I

00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:07,690
use to keep my tag synchronized with

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:13,700
what my project needs it to be I

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:17,930
executed and it replaces my tag with all

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:19,490
the stuff that I want to do so there's

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:23,180
some things that I want to use like if

00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:26,360
I'm and my a tag content changes based

00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:30,350
on the context so let's say that I was

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,300
editing a wiki to Beamer article I've

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,090
written these scripts that sit in my

00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,400
path called plus plus code plus plus

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:39,320
side that basically just interact with

00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,790
the Acme window that they've been called

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:46,880
from so I do a write a middle click on

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:49,550
plus plus code and it takes what I

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,170
highlighted and wraps it in code I can

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:58,220
do plus plus side plus plus slide and it

00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:59,960
puts a dummy slide in for me there all

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,220
of these are available on the github

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,480
you'll see a link to them in just a

00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,970
second we'll get into this a little bit

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,680
more in detail in just a minute so

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,560
that's the reason that well there's the

00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,150
link right there Acme tools there's the

00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,330
reason that it's a programmers interface

00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,010
I can make it do what I need to based on

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,610
the context of what I needed to have to

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,890
have happen

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:21,020
combining the power of plumbing with

00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,870
just touching files you don't have to

00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,880
there's no API well there is an API it's

00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:29,510
the file system the file system is the

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,659
API to Acme everything that Acme itself

00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:35,450
does is just a wrapper over the file

00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:37,489
system commands so that put command is

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,470
actually just executing send this string

00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:43,249
into the control file and it does it

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:45,700
very very powerful very very useful how

00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:45,700
am i doing on time

00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:57,499
five more minutes okay the let me show

00:33:55,009 --> 00:34:01,789
you a little bit are there any questions

00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:05,659
before I go any any further here about

00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:07,869
acne itself anything we've covered this

00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:07,869
far

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:42,329
it's just text and that was that that's

00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,220
that's to enable the power right it's

00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,589
it's it's not very pretty I'll give you

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:48,030
that so the comment was that it's kind

00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:50,990
of convoluted to go through the jump the

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:56,369
hoops to to get it installed and whatnot

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:58,079
that's actually a that's an artifact of

00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:01,260
it coming from plan nine which the

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,359
underlying architecture is so different

00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,950
that the paradigm is so vastly different

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,980
that there's a lot of shimming that has

00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:12,720
to take place to avoid that just in

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,359
because I'm doing acne under plan nine

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,250
port I have to jump through an extra

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,630
hoop or two with that 9p instead of just

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,599
using fuse or whatever and that's that's

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,950
a fuse bug that's not a 9p bug so the

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,720
acne doesn't have anything any say over

00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,799
that at all the the easier way of doing

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,170
that is just to use the standalone

00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:32,490
complex version if you don't want any of

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,049
the rest of the user line tools I'm

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:37,200
using some of the rest of the user land

00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:43,950
tools so I prefer to use PI nine ports

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:49,140
version you're still getting inter

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:51,450
interface with fuse but really yes and

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,150
no that so using sag going to get you

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,470
away from half an interface with fuse it

00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,180
depends if you're going to try to do

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:01,220
this advanced interface through the file

00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:04,530
system and it basically just defaults to

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:08,099
9p being easier than trying to set up

00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,839
fuse and debug the fuse bugs and it's

00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,849
really it's a simple script called 9p

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:15,420
and it's 9p right there's five there's

00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:16,859
five operations so it's it's it's it's a

00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,490
lot looks a lot more complicated than it

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:22,049
is I guess is what I'm trying to say let

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:26,990
me explain to you a couple of the things

00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:26,990
that I've done with my Acme tools

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:44,530
it's on github I've got a library I'm

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:52,180
gonna look at plus plus code and it's

00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:55,020
actually a sim linked to the plus plus

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:58,330
command so each of these is a sim link

00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,350
that points to this one command so I

00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,880
didn't have to write the command over

00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,020
and over and over again and then it

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,660
looks in the library to know what the

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,520
content it is it needs to wrap so kind

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:10,990
of interesting architecture it's written

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:15,520
in bash you'll see that okay let's make

00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:18,160
it a little bigger so this is plus plus

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,680
and then the same link name knows what

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,920
it's supposed to look for so basically

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,310
this is all of my boilerplate code that

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
I put in every bash script that I write

00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,690
that makes it a little easier to work

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:39,730
with and if we come down a little bit we

00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:42,400
get into the actual content there what

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,250
it's gonna do here is it's going to read

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,310
the content of the name it's going to

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:52,740
run a said command and it's going to

00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:57,610
read standard in so it takes standard in

00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:01,930
runs said for replace me and then spits

00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:04,030
it to standard out the script itself has

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:09,850
no idea that it's being run under acne

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:13,930
this script doesn't anyhow the thing

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:16,540
that it does is because there's a little

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,910
pipe here at the beginning of it what

00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,370
that says is take what I've highlighted

00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:25,330
put that into standard in take the

00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:28,270
output and put it back here I can modify

00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:31,990
that a little bit if I were to do

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:37,470
something like this and highlight this

00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:42,130
word and then change this pipe to a

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,510
greater than if I hit let me make this

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,500
just a bit bigger so you can see the

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,960
output

00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:51,340
if I hit execute on this middle-click

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,230
right the standardout is not going

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,780
through the standard in is still going

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,609
to the script standard out is no longer

00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,230
going back to this buffer it comes back

00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:02,920
to this special buffer that's called

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:05,080
Plus errors so anything that's not

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,140
explicitly rejected reject redirected

00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:14,200
back into the buffer goes into the air

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:17,230
console of acne alright it's just a file

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,900
in the Acme directory called Plus errors

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,920
yeah well it's a little different than

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,930
that easy I mean it does have a

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,670
directory there and you can control the

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:32,740
window but you don't need to fiddle with

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:36,310
yourself if I do it the other way with a

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:39,160
less-than what's going to happen is that

00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:42,010
there's not going to be any standard

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,619
input it's just going to take the output

00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,440
of that command and put it into my

00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:52,530
screen so it's going to actually replace

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,030
gargle splat with a blank code stanza as

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:58,020
opposed to wrapping it as it would do if

00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,520
it were piped does that make sense

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,900
so pipe says standard in and standard

00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:07,330
out are glued to this buffer greater

00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,859
than is standard in comes from the

00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:13,270
buffer goes through the script standard

00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:15,760
out comes over here less then says no

00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:20,050
standard in but the output comes back

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,180
into here kind of a cool little trick

00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:26,339
for running our scripts put them in your

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,339
path and you know and it's good to go

00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:34,810
I've got a couple of other Acme tools

00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,940
that I have written one of them is

00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,609
called a pass there's a bash script

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:44,940
called passive voice I do a lot of

00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:47,500
writing and I am a horrible linguist I

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,420
use passive voice I have a lot of

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:54,640
lexical allusions have you ever seen a

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:57,280
lexical illusion the the brown fox so

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,090
it's it's the lava and the AAA that's a

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,120
lexical illusion you

00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,950
I don't see it when they're together a

00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,350
computer can see that real easy so I

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,390
wrote some scripts passive voice weasel

00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,910
words so if you're doing if you're doing

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:13,660
a paper you don't want to do many of us

00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,890
believe right you want to be you don't

00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,800
want to be passive and you don't want to

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,410
have weasel words so I've written Acme

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,660
scripts that rap bash scripts that a guy

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,660
wrote to check all three of those things

00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:35,320
so if I let me bring this guy up we'll

00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:37,810
delete this column we will let's go

00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:44,290
ahead and delete this window as well and

00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:46,540
then we will do a new one I'm gonna show

00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,560
you how to how to browse files here am i

00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:53,310
doing on time five minutes ten minutes

00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,310
ten minutes all right

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:09,310
I'm just entering a path here also tab

00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,650
if you're used to using tab to do a

00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,510
completion you're not gonna get that

00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,030
knack me that's the thing that's been

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:20,200
the hardest for me you can do file name

00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:22,420
completion if you hit ctrl F so I've

00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:27,570
been bouncing this out with ctrl F to

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:35,500
get file name completion presentations

00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:39,510
capital a ctrl F example ctrl F now I

00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:44,500
put a get in here and I execute it and

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:47,170
now this is a file browser buffer so all

00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:50,770
I did is I put a directory name at the

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:53,980
beginning and then manually entered and

00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:59,310
executed the get command and now this is

00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:02,920
a file browser I'm gonna right click on

00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,660
this bash - app directory and it opens

00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,910
the new window with the directory of the

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,640
bash - app directory so that's how I can

00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:13,089
browse through directories find files

00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:15,970
very easily if I find a file I want to

00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:22,420
edit I right click on its name and it

00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:24,609
pops it open so here we have a story MD

00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,130
so it's just a markdown file with a

00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,500
bunch of stuff here's the lexical

00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,180
illusion who have you saw that right

00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,170
away

00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:37,630
no no one well lucky for us I can run

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,430
the a tag command and then there's a

00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,890
source file that says that this is a

00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:47,140
writing directory use the writing

00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:52,690
directory stuff in my tag and that gives

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:56,440
me the the code slide Nowicki and the a

00:43:52,690 --> 00:44:00,819
pass a Lexi and a wheeze so I want to

00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,859
double check the that this file doesn't

00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:06,280
have any weasel words and it doesn't

00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:09,640
have any passive voice and it doesn't

00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,810
have any lexical allusions so what I do

00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,550
is I right-click on it

00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,320
and what that does is it pits over here

00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,920
in the in the Plus Aires right there's a

00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,540
plus Aires it said this long filename

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,800
it's really hard to read so I'm gonna

00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:30,810
scoot it over just a bit this long

00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:34,860
filename on line 20 has the line were

00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:35,640
swept that's a weasel word or excuse me

00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,950
passable

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,710
that's a passive word were swept so if I

00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:45,630
right-click on it

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:56,540
remember it's plumbing many things were

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:56,540
swept under the rugs so let's do we just

00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:05,290
triggered the passive voice filter we

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,910
will click I'm not going to click put

00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:13,940
intentionally I'm going to back and go

00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:18,859
to execute a pass it says saving the

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:21,890
file it ran put for me and it ran the

00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:23,660
contents of the file through the passive

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:26,119
voice tool and the passive voice tool

00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:38,470
said no passive voice found let me show

00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:43,849
you what that one looks like a pass

00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:47,500
alright I've got some bash libraries

00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:50,270
that I've written that wrap up that 9p

00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,880
command and I can just do is Acme

00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:57,020
running it'll fail if not and then give

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,690
me the Acme window and then I can do if

00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,980
passive voice and the Sam file variable

00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,839
which is some of this one of the things

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,270
that Acme sets as it sends this data

00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:06,790
around it's how you get the access to it

00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:10,490
so this is the file name

00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:13,250
it'll X it was 0 if it passes or it'll

00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:16,579
say no passive voice found so what is

00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:24,770
the actual logic behind this well let's

00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:28,549
look at the library library Acme tools

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:33,890
main Lib and basically it says you know

00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:38,869
is Acme running yes if nine pls Acme

00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:40,280
returns test Acme running says if ask me

00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:42,829
is running we don't do anything but if

00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,760
it's not we're gonna exit where do we

00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:46,790
don't want the script to do anything

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:52,309
else if it's not running create a new

00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:54,020
Acme window and get the actual like five

00:46:52,309 --> 00:47:00,650
the real number of the window so you can

00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:03,650
then fiddle with it get the Acme mount

00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:07,160
point you can put a window so basically

00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:11,270
it says give me a this is the thing that

00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,240
ran put on my buffer so I Acme put

00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:17,590
window

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:20,810
says hey save the file and then go on

00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:22,970
right and then Acme clear tag is just

00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,710
doing a simple command called clear tag

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,990
which gets sent to the actual control

00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,120
file of that window empties the tag out

00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:32,330
and then we can read it or whatever we

00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:35,240
want later on so there's some variables

00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,250
that you can use that the shell scripts

00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,230
will set some environment variables and

00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,510
you use those to interact with your with

00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,670
your window numbers and the actual

00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,950
contents of the file through the filing

00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:47,480
system interface all of this is up on

00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,600
github if you want to look at it at your

00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:55,820
own perusal it's linked in that in the

00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:57,800
presentation as well let me look to show

00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:01,940
you a little bit about how there others

00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:10,850
work lexical illusions online - there's

00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:15,830
an a oh hey sure enough right there then

00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:21,890
let's do weasel words are a number I'm

00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:24,080
just going to take that out trip up the

00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:28,070
weasel words filter and then we will do

00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:30,140
weasel words last thing you need to know

00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:34,970
how to do and that is searching within

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:37,070
your buffer pardon me searching within

00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,320
your buffer is done the same way that

00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:44,380
you do plumbing that's why mouse button

00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:48,380
3 is overloaded quite a bit in your tag

00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:50,480
if you right click if you middle click

00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,240
it tries to execute the command if you

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:57,170
right click it uses what's known as the

00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,540
look command so the look command is

00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:02,090
what's going to do your searching

00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:05,570
through your your directory for that

00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:07,160
string I'm gonna put another to do right

00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:11,660
there in the middle but up here on my

00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:15,050
tag if I right click it goes from where

00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,850
the cursor was down the file and puts

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:19,220
the highlights it and puts my cursor on

00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,840
it I right-click again and it'll move me

00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,390
to the next one and then cycle back

00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,620
through the file so right clicking is

00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:27,100
how I can search

00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,240
highlight something in the buffer

00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,810
right-click it doesn't find another

00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:36,980
instance of canoe but I'm curious for

00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:42,160
all the A's and it'll iterate through

00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:47,440
all the A's alright so that's searching

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,440
you can also do a bunch of other things

00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:58,760
the Acme has a regular expression type

00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:03,080
engine so you can do a global search and

00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,940
replace and of course if you want to you

00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,680
can just pipe things through any command

00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,590
that's on your system use the pipe

00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:14,090
command and you know pipe it through

00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:15,980
said pipe it through your you're pretty

00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,500
printer perhaps you have an enforced

00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,240
coding standard right and you've got

00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,540
you've got some sort of what's the

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,250
what's the word they use for that the

00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,380
lint right you've got a lint system of

00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,910
some sort for your source code you can

00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,460
you can pipe it through your lint

00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:35,080
command or you could write a wrapper

00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:39,730
that has a command that just looks at it

00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:48,050
any other questions or comments yes

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:49,550
right is there a repository of scripts

00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:53,270
that run unfortunately there's not a

00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:57,350
central repository of those scripts your

00:50:53,270 --> 00:51:00,620
best bet however is to use the nine fans

00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:02,540
mailing list there's a searchable

00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,300
archive of the nine fans mailing list

00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:08,090
you search for acne you're gonna find a

00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,100
gob of little things like that I'll make

00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,240
sure there's a link to that there's not

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,650
one on the presentation but I'll make

00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,590
sure there's a link to that before I

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:27,310
push it up today to the nine fans

00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:30,800
mailing list it's like any very esoteric

00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:34,070
open source style mailing list it can be

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,350
a little aggressive rough at times a

00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:40,640
little bit

00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:42,470
I don't want to say uncivilized it's on

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,340
the Internet yes so it's it's a mailing

00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:50,720
list on the internet so plan accordingly

00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:54,590
right or you know put on your thick

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:59,570
leather skin gherkin before you get in

00:51:54,590 --> 00:52:01,460
there they are kind of gruff it's it's

00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,230
very much a oh you didn't look at all

00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:06,290
though or they'll respond with an answer

00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,450
that looks like this

00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:15,620
how do I do such and such an ACME and

00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:26,810
they'll say and the only response you

00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:28,370
will get is that and which yeah and if

00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,530
you're if you're reading your email in

00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,860
Acme all you have to do is right-click

00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,790
and you're you got your your answer

00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:39,140
actually the one thing that's really

00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:43,370
cool is some of the more kind gentleman

00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:46,190
there will actually put a regular

00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:48,650
expression in here to get you to the

00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,270
right word in the man page that you need

00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,510
to which is kind of cool it's cool that

00:52:50,270 --> 00:53:02,180
you can plumb that way right but yeah

00:52:53,510 --> 00:53:04,700
you had a question as well Aaron the

00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,080
question is when I was running the plan

00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,960
nine commands were they running through

00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:13,820
a plan nine shell or a Mac shell the

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:16,520
answer is whatever your profile does my

00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:25,580
dot files do some really magic stuff not

00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:31,180
magic but custom stuff I use a I use

00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:41,420
bash but by default it will open RC

00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:43,040
which is the plan nine shell I use again

00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,810
I do I go through those hoops to strip

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,330
all the color out of the commands just

00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,640
to make it easier on my life and thing

00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:52,680
that's funny you

00:53:48,640 --> 00:54:00,210
is if we do let's open up another window

00:53:52,680 --> 00:54:02,920
my prompt here the command is WI n I

00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,680
need to open a prompt window is how I

00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,240
remember is the Manik I use yeah so I

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,039
just right clicked on it or excuse me

00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,039
middle clicked on wind and it popped

00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:13,630
this up and we know it's a buffer which

00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:21,400
with a shell in it because it has a -

00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:25,779
host name ending on it my ps1 plain text

00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,940
none of the fancy scape codes and it has

00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:30,579
this unicode character in it so it's two

00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:33,210
lines and it has a unicode character at

00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:37,119
the beginning and I've also created a a

00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:42,670
function with this name in my aliases

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:44,859
array my dot files that is a no op why

00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:48,880
would I want to do that so I can cut and

00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:52,990
paste the entire line and have it

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,809
execute so so in my dot files this

00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:58,569
character is a no op so that I can cut

00:54:55,809 --> 00:55:01,920
and paste my entire line and it's a two

00:54:58,569 --> 00:55:06,099
line prompt as well for the same reason

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,609
all right any other questions any other

00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:08,609
comments

00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:23,390
this qualifies yes the the thing that I

00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:25,460
was told when I was learning acne and I

00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:30,829
got to put up a tile I'll put up a slide

00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:32,329
of additional info as well on this the

00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:35,930
thing that I was told when I first

00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:38,990
learned acne was think different no no

00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:41,150
no no different or no you're still not

00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:46,480
deep thinking different enough and it's

00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:50,180
it's true that learning curve is true so

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,289
it's it's definitely worth worthwhile it

00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,760
took me two and a half three weeks of

00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:57,230
forcing myself to use acne before I got

00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:06,380
to the point that I wasn't missing vim

00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:08,480
anymore the answer is is there any

00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:13,309
syntax highlighting and the answer is no

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,200
and that is because of science literally

00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:15,460
like syntax highlighting gets in your

00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,930
way

00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:24,460
it's a it's the it's the this is a kind

00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:26,690
of a dictate of syntax highlighting is

00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:30,020
sugar for your brain and it's not good

00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:33,500
for you you you need to write simpler

00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:35,329
code essentially is the answer sometimes

00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,910
you're stuck using the frameworks and

00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:40,789
tools you're on and I would really like

00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:44,329
syntax highlighting but write simpler

00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:45,589
code is the answer that you're gonna get

00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:50,359
from the plan nine guys and they asked

00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:53,440
me guys anyhow again contact me

00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:56,380
Goo's back comm slash contact

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,710
presentation Goosby comm is not yet live

00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:03,529
still have to add the a record to my DNS

00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:05,900
but it'll be there this weekend and

00:57:03,529 --> 00:57:08,779
it'll have this presentation including

00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:11,109
the actor actor action report that I

00:57:08,779 --> 00:57:15,109
promised you guys I promise you guys a

00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:17,390
list of resources I promised you the dot

00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:20,690
files and was there another thing I

00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:23,230
think that was it right all right well

00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:23,230
thank you very much

00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,060
your customers rely on your website or

00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:19,430
application if it's slower

00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:22,370
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:24,200
and costs you money keeping your

00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:27,690
business critical systems humming along

00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:30,510
requires insight into what they're doing

00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:32,520
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:34,770
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,079
resource limitations and other problems

00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:39,180
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:41,460
your systems performance metrics in real

00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:44,310
time and record this data for a liter

00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,290
analysis enter long view the new way to

00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:48,300
see what's really going on under the

00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,490
hood the long view dashboard lets you

00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,440
visualize the status of all your systems

00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:55,349
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,290
your entire fleet you can sort by CPU

00:58:55,349 --> 00:59:00,990
memory swap processes load and network

00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:03,300
usage click a specific system to access

00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:05,310
its individual dashboard then click and

00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,310
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:10,319
more detail comprehensive Network data

00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:13,020
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:15,000
is available on the network tab and disk

00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,160
writes and free space on the disk stab

00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,349
while the process Explorer displays

00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,900
usage statistics for individual

00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:24,060
processes the system info tab shows

00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,460
listening services active connections

00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:28,589
and available updates adding longview to

00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:30,810
a system is easy just click the button

00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:32,460
copy the one-line installation command

00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:35,130
then run the command on your Linux

00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,990
system to complete the process the agent

00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:38,940
will begin collecting data and sending

00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,490
it to long view then the graphs start

00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,010
rolling

00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:45,200
use Longview to gain visibility into

00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:49,119
your servers so when your website or app

00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,119
heats up it stays up

00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:57,090
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,310
ago we could not have imagined that

00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,530
asterisk would not only become the most

00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:03,630
widely adopted open-source communication

01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:05,700
software on the planet but that it would

01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:07,050
impact the entire industry in the way

01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,700
that it has today

01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:11,070
asterisk has found its way in the more

01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,320
than 170 countries and virtually every

01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:15,420
fortune 1000 company the success of

01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,550
asterisk has enabled a transition of

01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,770
power from the hands of the traditional

01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:21,600
proprietary phone vendors into the hands

01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:24,450
of the users and administrators of phone

01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,770
systems using this power our customers

01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,900
have traded all sorts of business

01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:29,550
changing applications from small office

01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,470
phone systems to mission-critical call

01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,480
centers the international carrier

01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:35,130
networks in fact there's even an entire

01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,140
country those communications

01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:38,880
infrastructure runs on asters the Jim

01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,040
has always been about creating

01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,480
technology that expands communications

01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,670
capabilities in ways that we could never

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,010
have imagined and that's part of what's

01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:49,080
game-changing about Digium today we're

01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:51,600
doing it again this time by introducing

01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,460
a new family of HD IP phones that

01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,350
extends control of the user all the way

01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,030
to the desktop the launch of these new

01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:59,370
products represents the next phase

01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:00,990
indigenous history of innovation these

01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:02,970
are the first and only IP phones

01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,560
designed to fully leverage the power of

01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:06,180
esters when we first discussed our

01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,980
expectations for building a family of

01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:10,140
phones for use with asterisk our

01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,880
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,500
the team to build the phones such that

01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,720
they were easy to install integrate

01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,520
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,100
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,750
that goal user feedback is validating

01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,030
that when it comes to operation with

01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:26,280
astro space systems including our own

01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:28,860
Switchvox based product these are the

01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,420
easiest to use best integrated most

01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,900
interoperable products on the market

01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,150
today

01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,730
the Digium family phones will initially

01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:37,530
include three IP desk phones uniquely

01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:39,840
designed to complement any asterisk or

01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:41,220
switch box based solution these phones

01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,100
are different for a number of reasons

01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:46,530
first there is cluesive Lee designed for

01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,180
use with esters secondly we've made it

01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,610
really easy to auto discover and

01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,720
provision the phones next we've made it

01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:54,240
easy for the phones to access

01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,970
information inside of asterisk allowing

01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,760
tight coupling between an application

01:01:55,970 --> 01:02:01,130
and the phone additionally we've created

01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,260
an applications engine that allows users

01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:06,500
and developers to create and run their

01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:08,270
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,220
done all of this at a very compelling

01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:12,140
price point at Digium were always

01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,000
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:16,580
the best value in business phone systems

01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,109
and also give them the power to create

01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:20,270
their own solutions for any

01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:22,010
communications challenge well continue

01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,450
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:25,490
Astra's cooler and faster more

01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:27,109
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:29,570
asterisk and what communications even

01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:33,280
easier and together will change the way

01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,280
the world communicates again

01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,150
that's the every way this is the way to

01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:53,070
better utilize all your resources and it

01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:56,580
makes managing all your resources pretty

01:02:53,070 --> 01:03:01,260
easy all of the innovation is happening

01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:04,380
in open source the collaborative nature

01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:07,170
and of the you know of the community and

01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,090
the speed at which these these you know

01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,040
these these deficiencies these bugs are

01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:13,440
getting discovered and then fixed is

01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,060
that I think that really shows the power

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,820
of the you know of the open source

01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:19,970
community it is global and it's

01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:23,520
definitely because of the users

01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:29,160
community people are extremely friendly

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,050
and they're always ready to help if you

01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,330
go on tire see any day you'll see these

01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:35,060
guys helping each other out and they're

01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:37,770
all doing it like in a selfless manner

01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:40,760
the product is transparent for everyone

01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:43,380
everyone can look at the codebase

01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:45,450
everyone can see how cloud stack is

01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,440
being built nothing nothing is

01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:51,690
proprietary

01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:54,330
everything is open in many ways it's

01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:58,770
absolutely vital to the to the ongoing

01:03:54,330 --> 01:04:02,970
health cloud stack the most exciting

01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:05,780
event in recent memory for me was our

01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:08,210
first developer boot camp

01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:11,090
and our call gave people I think maybe

01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:14,960
two weeks notice to come attend I was

01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:19,250
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:22,070
up with 87 people and had to go get more

01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:24,590
chairs in the room twice everything

01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:27,860
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:30,890
is open-source and so I don't think that

01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,690
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,720
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:38,420
computing and so I think it's I think

01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,770
it's an assumption I think when you talk

01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,940
about cloud computing you're really

01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:45,890
talking about open source cloud

01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:48,860
computing cloud sack is a robust

01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:50,660
solution for large deployments you'll

01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:52,550
have dozens of data centers and

01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:56,960
thousands of servers in each data

01:04:52,550 --> 01:05:00,740
centers these hardware is gonna fail and

01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:03,620
cloud stack is designed to handle number

01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:05,390
one that mass scale number two it's

01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:08,690
designed to handle the failure that

01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:11,300
inevitably happens in large deployments

01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:16,280
we started working on contact over four

01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:19,160
years ago and it was the original set of

01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,750
people working on it had a background of

01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:24,830
delivering software to telcos and

01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:28,370
service providers lots of QA lots of

01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:32,270
users actually using it high

01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:35,090
availability is a key feature multiple

01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:37,250
hypervisor support different network

01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,660
models we can pick up what I was to see

01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:40,280
better

01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:43,600
well step management server can be

01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:46,400
deployed in different physical machines

01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,050
it definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:53,570
being deployed everywhere there's a

01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:55,210
major movie studio that they were using

01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:58,400
cloud stack they were using it to

01:05:55,210 --> 01:06:00,560
transmit video and I thought that was

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,910
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:05,150
fascinating is what they did during

01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:07,940
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:09,080
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,970
lunch was over they would

01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:14,450
all the instances and get back to doing

01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:16,250
real work CloudStack is vast

01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,810
it touches so many different aspects and

01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,030
there's no one person that's kind of

01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:23,240
like a master of all those realms I

01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:26,180
think CloudStack as a project is going

01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:29,980
to be one of the leaders simply because

01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:36,650
it's some of the most feature fully and

01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:39,880
and robust platforms out there I don't

01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,880
see you're living through the clouds dag

01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,789
most enterprises today realize that

01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:59,440
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:01,059
enough to keep their network safe from

01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,460
unauthorized intrusions

01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:05,680
that's why two-factor authentication has

01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:07,630
gotten so popular lately that adds that

01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,510
extra layer of protection enterprise

01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:12,490
networks need to stay safe but what you

01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,680
may not know is that some two-factor

01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,900
authentication solutions they're better

01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:19,960
than others like two-factor strong

01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:22,210
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,190
beyond other authentication systems by

01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:26,020
being less expensive easier to implement

01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:28,510
and easier to use

01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,490
giving software-based token clients

01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:34,059
built to run on all major devices and

01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:36,339
OSS including iOS and Android these

01:07:34,059 --> 01:07:38,680
tokens utilize a public/private key

01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:40,839
combination that's generated on device

01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,450
so there aren't any shared secrets

01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:45,579
flying around or attackers to hijack or

01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:48,190
which require any special handling

01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:50,260
instead all keys are kept secure and

01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:52,660
private between the requesting token and

01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:55,089
your server which you control in-house

01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,730
making it the most secure way possible

01:07:55,089 --> 01:08:00,339
to perform authentication encryption but

01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:02,410
with an extensive flexible API that

01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:05,170
support for protocols like LDAP and
