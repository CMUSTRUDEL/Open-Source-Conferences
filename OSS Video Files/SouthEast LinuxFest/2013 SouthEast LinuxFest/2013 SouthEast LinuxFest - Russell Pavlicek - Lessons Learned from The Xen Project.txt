the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,810
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000

possible get excellent thank you good

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,570
morning how many woke up this morning

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,320
show fans will wake the rest up before

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,600
you're done my name is Russ pavlicek

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,540
this is hopefully the talk you came to

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,649
see otherwise it's going to be very

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,039
interesting for you so who's the old Fat

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,020
geek up front me I've been around for a

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,219
long time and I've got a great big mouth

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,230
which is why I'm here uh-uh there's a

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,690
short form I've been dealing with Linux

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,900
since 95 I've had a Linux desktop since

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:13,020
97 I wrote a column long time ago for

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:18,000
input and I definitely not sure where

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,409
that came from processor magazine used

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,270
to be a regular on the Linux show

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,640
webcast Famer and remember the Linux

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:30,570
show one closest thing right now is

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:41,460
Linux link tech show and I was actually

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:45,350
on that a week and a half ago so okay

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,060
there's the NSA okay so people actually

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,380
if you go to linux link tech show which

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,909
is TL LTS org episode 5 07 i was on

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,210
there and they let me roll for 90

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,880
minutes so if if you like what I'm

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,700
saying today you can find more there so

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,130
I've been around I was actually in the

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,869
open source world for several years at

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,300
the beginning and then got swallowed

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,900
into the abyss of clothes source for a

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:17,430
few years so I exited purgatory and have

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,459
returned to the light and as I mentioned

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,980
to some of you are here I started with

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:27,930
citrix in January I've never been to a

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,870
citrix office and my job is you folks

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,850
basically is talking with the open

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,840
source community and dealing with the

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:41,989
open source project team there is a

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:45,630
second talk i'm doing sunday afternoon

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,700
that is a more Zen technical tech talk

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,260
if you're interested in zen or you want

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,570
to know more about then that's the talk

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,670
to go to we're going to talk about the

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,079
architecture some of the current good

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,250
stuff that's coming along inside the

00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,620
project and some of the stuff that's

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,610
coming up so if you if you want the

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,650
technical low down to 45 sunday will go

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,260
into that that's not what this talk is

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,810
about this talk I'm going to spend a

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,090
couple minutes just sort of acclimating

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,530
to the projects I don't know how much

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,500
time people are how much stuff people

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,480
know about then then we'll spend a few

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,579
minutes just discussing history of zens

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,340
and project but we're going to try to

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,600
spend a bulk of the time on take away in

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,380
other words what were the lessons that

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,579
we can learn for any project based on

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,299
some of the things that have happened

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,769
with Zen project so that's what I'm here

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,239
for today that's what this session is

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,570
going to be it's going to be focusing on

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,540
what does it take to keep that keep any

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,230
project viable based on what we've seen

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,510
so what is then project premier open

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,070
source hypervisor if you don't believe

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,400
that i can point you the website and

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,689
will use exactly that phrase

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,849
we power some of the biggest clouds in

00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,709
the industry see some up there Rackspace

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,980
open cloud amazon if you're an Amazon

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:05,670
user yours end-user way it is terremark

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,950
just announced a big cloud thing that's

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,329
all Zen based so there's a bunch of

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,329
stuff out there we're on our 10th

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,950
anniversary then it's not a newbie thing

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,139
by any stretch of the imagination and

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,539
about six weeks ago we announced it is

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,090
now part of Linux Foundation as a

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:24,479
collaborative project a really big deal

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,190
for us and in case you don't think

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,470
people care about then just look at some

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,860
of the charter organizations that signed

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:36,270
on at the time all of these have a stake

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,919
in seeing the Zen project grow strong so

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,470
I mean that was actually a really cool

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,710
event and it's a good thing to have

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,060
happened because as we'll see there's

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,880
been some discussion about whether Zen

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,580
is really open source etc etc and we're

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,120
clearing that out right now so Linux

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,000
Foundation great stuff there what does

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,300
it produce Xen hypervisor most people

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,370
I'm sure I've at least heard of that

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,050
including arm servers won't you talk

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,599
about that a little bit more in depth in

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,240
the sunday talk but that's actually very

00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:12,360
exciting it is a type 1 hypervisor and

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,150
we'll talk more about this in sunday but

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,500
type 1 means it runs on the bare metal

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:22,380
it is not an instance sitting either in

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,030
the kernel or a user space to create a

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,550
virtual machine that's not the way it

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,120
works it actually runs on the metal and

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,780
then you have then you have OS running

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,599
in it so it's a bit different in that

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,020
regard and that's also an advantage that

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,250
we can talk about a little bit later but

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,699
we also have things like Zen cloud

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,610
platform and zappy as it is sometimes

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,580
called basically it's cloud out of the

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,930
box it's designed that way in fact one

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,240
of the really interesting thing is if

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,039
you go back to some of the earliest

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,110
documents relating to Zen some of the

00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,639
earliest design documents in late 90s

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,430
when there's just talking about the

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,260
concept they actually talk about a cloud

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,150
concept

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,720
it was engineered for that before the

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,610
term cloud was ever adopted so it was it

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,620
was really breaking new ground at the

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,200
time it was it was very interesting

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,880
there are some subprojects to that once

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,170
again Sunday if you're interested come

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,140
back we'll talk a little bit more about

00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,050
the Mirage project which has to do with

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,920
these teen tiny little dedicated VMs

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,230
that do marvelous things and and then

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,110
the arm hypervisor for mobile devices

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,000
you know it's like you know someone said

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,780
why would you want virtualization on

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,950
something like this well you know I am

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,950
old enough that when I went to college

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:49,760
right after the earth's surface cool

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:52,370
this this would have been like not more

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,190
computing power than the entire campus

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,910
had but several orders of magnitude more

00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,430
computing power than the campus happy

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,880
really amazing so I think that you know

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,930
if you can't think of a use case for

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,250
this having virtualization it's because

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,450
well I've heard a couple proposed but I

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,770
think there's going to be a killer use

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,450
case that no one has actually thought

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,190
about because no one thinks about it I

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,020
mean who thinks about doing this well

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,250
some people are and we're going to see

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,020
something interesting come out of this

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,450
we may have a cloud in your pocket

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,210
before long I think get kind of weird

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,490
but it could be really interested so

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,620
what's the Zen project story the 30

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,330
second version it was the first

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,720
industrial strength open source

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:39,730
hypervisor who very high rate of

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,960
adoption initially excellent technology

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,230
no one's ever really knocked the

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,300
technology it had at the time a source

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,240
friendly corporation behind it zend

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,060
source and yet if you looked at the

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,490
status of things two years ago who was

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,230
at the risk of being basically forgotten

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,030
in the open source world now

00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,020
you know this can leave you shaking your

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:07,420
head it had everything going for it and

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,790
yet it almost became a footnote in

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:15,370
open-source history how did this happen

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:18,910
the project was viable it was doing good

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:22,330
stuff it has good stuff what it started

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:25,570
sort of developing an inward folks it

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:30,180
wasn't really doing all that needed to

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:32,110
do on all levels to reach out beyond it

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,050
the reach out to the open source

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:39,700
community was limited there was some

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:41,950
stuff going on but you know based on

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,810
what I'm actually hearing from firsthand

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,360
from people they're saying we didn't

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,040
hear it like we're hearing it now reach

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,300
out to the user base was minimal and

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,240
that's that's when the frankly we're

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,760
still trying to work on because Zen is

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
you know very intensely you know down

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,150
low it's you know kind of Colonel ish

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,510
you know you're dealing with stuff

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,210
running on metal but that user

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,120
connection was still fairly minimal code

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,880
development was good but the community

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:15,250
itself sort of seemed to develop an

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:17,260
inward focus no one was stepping up when

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,580
rumors started to spread about zens

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:25,060
demise you didn't hear a lot inside the

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:29,010
linux / open source / trade press saying

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:33,790
no no no we're here and we're standing

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:38,380
so there was this cocoon that seemed to

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:41,110
be building to a certain extent the

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,760
project seem to forget the importance of

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,530
working fully within its ecosystem you

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,840
have things like upstream projects the

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:56,620
colonel qmu they were being branched

00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:01,690
rather than rather than having the

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:04,180
patches going in because the the colonel

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,980
and QM you had to be enabled for certain

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,130
things in Zen so they were branched they

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,870
branched those projects but somehow

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,840
those patches weren't getting back into

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,300
the mainstream what does that mean that

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,690
means that other parts of the ecosystem

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:23,260
like the distributions then had to

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,600
compensate how many people remember you

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,490
know whether user or not when you do if

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,650
you would crack open your CD your linux

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,820
CD and there'd be a then Colonel in

00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:36,310
there remember that yeah no more that's

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,200
because for a while those important

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,850
colonel patches weren't going back into

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,290
the kernel so you needed a specialty

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:47,170
patch colonel to play with them and so

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,000
the distributions were the ones out of

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,500
the time that had to deal with the care

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,700
and feeding of these things that's a lot

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,660
to ask and it went on too long and

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,260
frankly the other parts of the ecosystem

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,610
that had to feed this got fed up because

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,040
you'll carry that weight for a little

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,300
while but after a while you have to play

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,400
well with others then the corporation

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,910
backing at Zen source was sold to a

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,860
close source corporation that's not the

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,220
end of the planet but that means that

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:22,120
things change and the new corporation of

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,310
course like the technology but it sure

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,410
wasn't an open source corporation it you

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,040
know and all indications are it didn't

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:33,570
really know what to do with this project

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,570
that it inherited

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:41,480
so the bottom line is not about malice

00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,820
no one was trying to kill zen it's not

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,430
about fear it was about disconnection

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,320
and that's the point I'm going to be

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,779
working with a little bit here first the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,740
project was disconnected from you folks

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,000
there are people going out and doing

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,339
some talk in a little bit here in a

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,910
little bit there but by and large not

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:03,440
nearly as much as needed to be done the

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,660
project became disconnected from its

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,850
users it wasn't getting all the feedback

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,940
it needed about what was going right or

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,440
wrong and then the new company and the

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,889
project had its own sense of

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,720
disconnection and you know in fact i was

00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:19,940
at texas linux fest last week and

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,699
someone was asking about the problems

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,970
that you know canonical ubuntu or going

00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:28,339
through every open source company and

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,899
project combination has to figure out

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,829
what to do and this end the solution I'm

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,260
convinced it's going to be different in

00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,910
every case just slightly at least so

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,500
there is this wrestling that has to

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,040
happen there is this sanity check that

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:47,720
has to happen and for a long time the

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:52,760
citrix relationship was not resolving

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,750
itself the way a chip and the clicker is

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,750
not doing the mothership

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:04,060
thank you two years ago this is more or

00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:08,080
less the status of what things look like

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,020
prognosis wasn't very good hi Xen

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:16,300
hypervisor have been overtaken in mind

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:17,680
share by commercial interests VMware you

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,760
know commercial company doing what a

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,970
commercial company should do it's

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,950
blowing its horn it was also

00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,600
overshadowed by another open source

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:30,130
offering kvm and once again they were

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,380
doing what they were doing you know

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,840
there wasn't any issues about that they

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,850
were doing what they should be doing

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,180
distributions stop facilitating Zen or

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,010
at least we're considering stopping it

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,470
most notable of course has been the

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,290
latest edition of red hat it's red hat

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,320
enterprise linux you know they've gone

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,720
on the kvm they've invested in the kvm

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,750
technology and they've made a business

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,630
decision to go that way but also other

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,250
distributions were following suit and if

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,520
and the open source community be just

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:09,160
began to forget Zen became yesterday's

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:12,730
news and about two years ago people at

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,490
citrix decided you know what something's

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,190
got to change this has to be rescued

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,400
this has to be brought in into the for

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,600
again but we don't know how to do this

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,030
there's actually one of the smartest

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,190
decisions they could do they went ahead

00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,990
and they actually went out and they

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:34,750
found people who understood open source

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:36,220
and said help us fix this you know i'll

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,780
tell you i wish more companies would do

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,950
that that is actually that's one of the

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,740
brightest things that you can do when

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:44,860
you're dealing with it and so they

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,770
brought people in and the net effect is

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,660
that there are several originally citrix

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,850
based owning 'he's which have now gone

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,740
into the open source arena and i don't

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,630
think we're done yet but apache

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,800
cloudstack you'll hear some of those

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:03,870
guys here today you know that came out

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:07,180
of cloud com that was a citrix own

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,300
technology opendaylight just announced

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,830
about a month ago interesting things

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,730
going on there and then of course the

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,680
move of Zen project to linux foundation

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,440
so all these things have come about

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,360
inside the past couple years in order to

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,650
play well within the open source

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:30,940
community and this clicker is driving me

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:35,920
nuts just sing something once I get this

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:40,600
straight okay the clicker has now

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:45,100
officially lost its mind good now let's

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,500
try to get this right two years ago Lars

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,790
Kurth community manager for zen said

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,420
these were the things used to hear when

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:57,970
he would go to meetings like this what's

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,710
then zens dead right isn't that close

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,540
source now is bought by some companies

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,220
closed source and no one uses then

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,960
anymore you know these these were the

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,800
things that were absolutely normal for

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,530
him to hear frightening but normal and

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,390
today is very different right now with

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,390
the linux 3.8 colonel everything that

00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:19,660
you need to facilitate then is in the

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:22,450
mainstream colonel the era of the zen

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,080
kernel is dead because it's part of

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:30,310
linux now most distributions are now Zen

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:33,310
enabled again big exception is rel but

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:35,140
even then actually I was talking to one

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,630
of the centos guys who was involved with

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,420
this just last week in Texas there's a

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:44,770
centos project underway to try to refit

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:48,400
Zen into centos so that if you happen to

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:52,480
be working on a rel then stack with rel

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:55,240
5 and you don't want to go to kvm in rel

00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,060
6 you might soon be able to migrate to

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:02,770
centos 6 then instead very interesting

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,660
project indeed but that's the centos

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,730
guys they are going ahead and doing that

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,930
and I think that's great as I said Zen

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,820
projects part of the Linux Foundation

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,530
and we've got a new web so how many

00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,320
people have been to zend project they

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,630
ought to work the new website I'm not

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:21,700
letting you out of the room till it

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:24,070
until you go then but please take a look

00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,830
at that that was one of the first task I

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,540
have when I got on board working with

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,880
sin is that we knew we had to birth this

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:34,090
website if you've been to the have you

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,990
been to old Zenda org anyone how would

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,420
you characterize the old zend org

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:43,630
forgettable it looks like it's ten years

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:47,170
old and it really is developer focused

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,660
you know I mean that's really it's kind

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,840
of an exchange of high highly technical

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,700
information but not really a good place

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,130
for that person that says hey I want to

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,740
learn about this project come then

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,450
project org we're trying we're trying to

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,160
have that information available for the

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,640
developers but by the same token we want

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,790
something that everyone else can read so

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,260
please please please please go there

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,910
sign up for an account we won't spam you

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,200
with email to sign up for an account

00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:18,280
we're going to have some good stuff

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,680
coming real soon there but then please

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,300
give us feedback please give me feedback

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,050
nothing else you know you don't wanna

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,490
use the form send me email I just want

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,140
to know what that were hitting the mark

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,240
here or what we have to add or change or

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,510
whatever so please it's really important

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,880
but that's part of the thrust is that we

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:41,080
want to be good members of the open

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,970
source community so what have we learn

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,600
through all this this is really the

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,260
heart of the talk lesson one it's

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,490
possible to die while you're winning

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,970
that's not one of those things that you

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,490
think about too often but being first is

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,380
not enough then was pretty well first

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,100
and what it was doing great technology

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,100
is not enough

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:11,360
let's see let's see how many people have

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,360
gray hairs in the temples Windows 3.1

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:24,360
IBM had something else what was

00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:26,670
something else called os/2 warp look how

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,770
many people think 3.1 was vastly

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:34,050
superior to OS to show of hands none and

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,690
that is about the general consensus of

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:42,690
the world which 11 in the marketplace

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:44,880
windows if that was the old illustration

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,160
I had it would be enough but if you go

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,980
back in the history of software the

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,130
greatest ideas don't always rise to the

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:56,280
top so even if you just have a

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:58,920
blisteringly great concept don't assume

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,450
that that's all you need to make a

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,110
splash to make a difference in the world

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,520
and having a open source friendly

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,720
corporation isn't enough then had that

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,050
but things change we'll talk about that

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,740
in another the project itself has to

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:18,900
stay vibrant as a community has to say

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:24,240
vibrant as an organization as an

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:27,090
organism in order to succeed if you are

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,190
disconnected from your users you can be

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:34,290
the walking dead you can be adding

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,360
functionality issuing releases doing all

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,990
sorts a great stuff but if you haven't

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,010
connected with your users properly maybe

00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,930
on the way out and you don't realize it

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:48,480
the connection is essential and the

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,210
focusing on the software alone is not

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,610
sufficient I mean you know we're geeks

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,610
we like playing with the bits it's fun

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:59,640
it's a rush but we got to remember to

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:03,090
reach out and find out how people are

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,440
using our bits because you know the open

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,580
source world of course we're not looking

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,560
about what we got have profits and all

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,960
those no not necessarily but you want to

00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,000
have people using what you call

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,640
you want to have people say hey this was

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,360
cool it solved my problem thank you if

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:23,620
you're there you're good but if you

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,620
don't know you maybe you maybe two

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,900
nights work from giving them something

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,870
terrific and instead they're not

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,610
touching your code you have to reach out

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,289
and you have to have that connection so

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,780
if you're not interaction interacting

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:43,440
with your users inside some ways you're

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:45,850
at risk also this is very zen ish

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,140
reaching out to your developers it's not

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,140
the same thing as reaching out to your

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,360
users you may be doing pretty well as

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,830
far as your project team you know we got

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,490
people all over the world or however

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,380
it's happening but you need to do more

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,030
than just facilitate your developers

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,950
that's fine when you're in an alpha

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,770
stage you know and people aren't really

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,500
trying to use your code yet but you have

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,510
to progress you're going to issue

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,820
something that users can use you've got

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,559
to be talking to your users if they're

00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,500
digging through a whole bunch a

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,640
technical goop to get to the user

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,159
information you're missing something

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,390
once again as geeks be really really

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
nice if you didn't have to worry about

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,440
that but that's actually where you are

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,270
going to learn as you develop that stuff

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,460
you're going to learn what they need and

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,070
that's it that's really important for

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,960
your survival and even the Linux kernel

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,580
you know I mean you think about it when

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,350
people use Linux they're normally

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,419
talking about the stacks of stuff on top

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,179
of Linux you could argue that the links

00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:48,130
colonel serve insulated from users but

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,350
even still if you look at the way the

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,100
colonel sent to develop it has to be

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,690
aware of what users need it may not get

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,150
you know that that really tight

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:01,270
connection that some you know like you

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,700
know gooeys and stuff do but anywhere

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:08,380
any project you've got to have that user

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:12,410
connection lesson three never ignore the

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,700
root structure you know

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,960
I've used this this imagery for years

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,790
how many business people particularly

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,020
you know about 15 years ago and say

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,340
always open source stuff you know the

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,230
technology is great but you got all this

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,180
ugly community just let's just get rid

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,930
of all this ugly community stuff and

00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,810
we'll have something that's really

00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:32,960
beautiful that's the cut flower syndrome

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:35,090
man cut flowers are gorgeous for about

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,600
three days and then you throw them away

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:43,340
because they're dead community needs

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:46,940
roots because it's alive if you don't

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,760
have roots and roots get ugly back life

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,520
if you don't have those roots you're

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,740
going to die so you must foster your

00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,680
roots and that roots has to do with

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:05,030
community and the project team can't

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:06,320
stand alone so pay attention identify

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,080
your partner's I mean if you've got some

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,850
little widget that's just sitting there

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,820
and it's you know kind of like the

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:16,460
quickie calculator you know bc or

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,490
something you know you can kind of say

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,790
well that's my universe is pretty small

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:25,810
but every other you know all these more

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:29,120
elaborate projects you have libraries

00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:32,450
you have distributions it's like who's

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,610
feeding you are you talking to them are

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,820
they giving you what you want will they

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:41,330
continue to give you what you want talk

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,730
to them be involved with what they're

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,710
doing you know you've got your you've

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,630
got colonel issues if it's if it's lower

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,480
level kind of like Zen is if you've got

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,920
packaging issues now how many times have

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,450
you said oh wow you know look at this

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,770
look at this new project I just buy this

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,660
is cool i'm going to download this thing

00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,210
next thing you know you go to you go to

00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,280
install and it's like crap i have to i

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,500
have to upgrade to three levels higher

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,120
in Nome and I have to bring bringing a

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,280
whole bunch of stuff that's that's in

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,890
the alpha stage over here and you know

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,360
i'm gonna i'm going to redline my system

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,460
here let's try not just trying to get

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,020
this thing going you know if we're not

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,620
talking with the other members of the

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,540
ecosystem and giving giving out things

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,390
that can be used by real honest-to-god

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,230
people and not everyone living leading

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,770
at the

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,480
edge we're not going to do so well so

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,520
you got to be aware mindful of your

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,940
libraries and the other things that feed

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,700
you and play well with don't ignore your

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,530
support structure in zend case a lot to

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,690
do with distributions distributions had

00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,870
to play well and we loaded them down

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,340
with too much once again if you have

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,179
something that you can just take up an

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,470
atar ball go and it just installs great

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:55,309
but if you're a project that has any

00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:56,660
more complexity you got to play well are

00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:58,250
you you know you have the right

00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,830
libraries and stuff they're going to be

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,790
usable there and so forth so packaging

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,559
becomes real important is it available

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:09,320
if is the guy on redhat going to have

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:14,270
the same easy experience that the guy on

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,230
a bun do and 12 does for installation if

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,760
you want to get out there and have

00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,160
things used you have to be able to

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,370
address that question if it can be done

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:27,710
great if it's not being done you got to

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:31,340
find a solution in the cases then

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:33,380
particularly you had red hat sort of

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,380
saying well we're going to do the kvm

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,700
stuff and the hell with zen we're not

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,090
even going to facilitate any more

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,860
business decision their choice and as a

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,400
result for a while some of the other

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,440
distributions we're saying yeah why not

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,559
we don't want to do the work either and

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,220
if if people are moving away from it we

00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:56,179
don't want to invest the time so you

00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,549
could find yourself in that situation

00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:01,429
you want to make sure you stay on top

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,530
and not and have to have your friends

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,150
and make sure you're playing well with

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,429
your distributions or other than the

00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,350
other thing so that distribution route

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:12,070
can be absolutely critical depending on

00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:15,130
the type of project that you're working

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:18,110
having corporate backing isn't enough

00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:21,490
you know because any any situation

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:24,110
whether it's open source friendly or not

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,460
the corporation has goals going this way

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,610
the project has goals going this way

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,220
fact of life why because corporations

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:33,020
have to make money they got to do things

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,010
they've got business goals

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,170
the project has project goals if if it's

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,670
really really good you know they might

00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,070
be more or less going in the same

00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,230
direction but they're always going to be

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:49,100
differences and those always have to be

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,840
resolved you got to make sure that you

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,090
understand each other's goals and you're

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,310
facilitating each other's goals and that

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,670
doesn't matter whether you're whether

00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:04,960
you're red hat or whether you're the

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:07,460
abyss I don't sorry about that to anyone

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,020
you know because I mean that that's one

00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,790
instance that you know a lot of people

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,830
aren't too happy with some of the things

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,570
going on there they're making their

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,950
decisions they're living with if you

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,740
want better you got to do better and

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:22,100
it's not about good versus evil it's

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,140
about business goal project goal that's

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,820
why you can't have the dysfunction

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,880
between them you have to figure out what

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,680
it takes to get them both together

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,290
having an open source company behind you

00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,760
is no guarantee you know some people

00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:36,770
think that's the brass ring you've got

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,480
you've got this open source friendly

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,000
company behind you all is going to be

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,020
right with the world right open source

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,100
companies can be sold or they can go

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,870
under or any number of other things and

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,550
that's what happened with zen they went

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,620
from having a you know very open source

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:58,490
friendly company suddenly one of the

00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:02,090
classic old closed source companies well

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:04,400
you know big change some open source

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,230
companies go a gentler ooh you know

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,090
remember jboss was on its own cluster

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,180
was on its own they're all fire red hat

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,800
now one big happy family etc etc but

00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,520
that doesn't always happen that way you

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,990
know mysql zand listed casada i used to

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,000
work for a company called cassatt that

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,130
probably no one has ever heard of it was

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,810
a startup that used to consume a lot of

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,520
open source company actually did some

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:28,790
terrific stuff about cloud

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,660
infrastructure even before the term

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:35,030
cloud was used and it was open source

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,830
friendly and we were kept debating you

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,150
know some of us we're hoping that the

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,770
open they would open source some of the

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:45,750
product didn't happen then then during

00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:48,390
the banking crisis of five years ago our

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:52,050
11 and a half front-month runway became

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,640
three weeks and we got the phone call

00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,430
it's like well you have a job but you

00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,570
don't have a paycheck and we're trying

00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:02,130
to sell off such as we have and so they

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,790
sold off some of the assets and the

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:08,790
human compatible live where to a company

00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:12,330
that was even more classic holds close

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:14,100
source and a company where I swear the

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,620
lawyers probably had a picture of

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,080
richard stallman dressed in a devil suit

00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,160
with a pitchfork uses a dart board on

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,630
the wall they were scared to death of

00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,960
the GPL and anything to do with open

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:30,000
source just petrified so you went from a

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:35,520
situation where there was an open-source

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,390
sensitivity to just nothing that can

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,410
happen that can happen especially in

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,540
open source world because when you

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,340
consider open-source companies you know

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,750
the business model for open-source

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:51,320
company is cast firmly in jello you know

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,300
Red Hat's done about the best job of it

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,670
but when push comes to shove it's kind

00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,380
of rough it is so much simpler to say we

00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,810
own this stuff and if you want the stuff

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,460
you come to us and you pay for it

00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:06,420
classic closed source model easy to

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,760
understand Red Hat's done a really

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:13,290
admirable job of saying well we'll give

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,670
you the bits jordam but if you want

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,610
anything more if you want to support and

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,780
all that stuff you come to us ease of

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,930
distribution you come to us all that

00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,560
sort of good stuff so it's a model that

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,000
isn't you know it still isn't fully

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,220
baked I mean they're doing a good job

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,600
but it's every open-source company you

00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,250
look at just a little different in that

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,330
regard we're still trying to figure out

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:38,370
the right recipe for the pudding so if

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,690
you're in a state where you've got a

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,580
project you've got this open-source

00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,100
company behind you and you start playing

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,070
the game of what would happen if this

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,860
company donkeys and you start saying

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,420
yourself we're in deep sneakers at this

00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,480
company dies then you might want to

00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,800
consider something like a foundation

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,960
route hi chi foundation legs

00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,140
one of these sorts of takes to make sure

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,220
your project if it's you know reasonably

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,290
sizable because they don't they're not

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,510
going to deal with you know five guys in

00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,880
a garage type thing but but if you've

00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,670
got a reasonably good sizeable project

00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,200
and yet it's sort of all hinging on this

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,470
company you might want to actually take

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,850
it the foundation around to make sure

00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,260
that if something happens in the

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,640
economics and God knows what the

00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,280
economics in the world are like these

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:29,710
days that the project is going to

00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:31,630
survive and thrive consideration lesson

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:35,950
7 in open source there's no such thing

00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:37,210
as autopilot this is a real hard lesson

00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,380
for some people to learn we've always

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:43,240
done it that way yeah get over it

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:47,320
yesterday isn't today and today won't be

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,970
tomorrow your intent is critical you

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,310
have to plan to succeed now once again

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,130
in the open source sense succeeding is

00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:55,870
not making noodles and gobs of money but

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,160
succeeding is making code that people

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:02,080
are using solving problems for folks

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,850
well how are you going to do that well

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,050
you start off by doing that neat idea

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,880
thing and you throw it out there and

00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,800
people that is a neat idea i claim with

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,360
this but if you're going to go farther

00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,150
than that you have to start planning a

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:19,000
little bit what's your niche you know

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:21,340
you have to look at software alone you

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,830
know just because you were first in

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,150
another then truism just because you

00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,940
were first in doesn't mean that someone

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:30,310
else's go come on say hey I got a better

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,590
idea than that we'll use that concept

00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:35,050
and we'll add this to it and we'll make

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,000
it a powerhouse of things and watch more

00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,700
we'll get some giant big company with

00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,250
deep pockets behind us to make sure it

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,590
happens well suddenly you can find

00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:48,010
yourself looking at the afterburners of

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:50,530
the guy that came after you so you have

00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,210
to have these things in mind it's not

00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:55,020
enough just to have that good technical

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:57,130
solution you've got to have a plan and

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,780
if you aren't looking at your whole

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,400
ecosystem if you're just sort of

00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,040
throwing it out on the website say go

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,660
you know pick it up if you want well

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,790
what more can you you can talk to the

00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,260
distributions there they're open source

00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,750
guys like you

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,190
say what it take from you know to get

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,260
you interested in you know putting it

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:21,169
inside your code base so that's you know

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,950
it's there in the repository come on so

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,570
it's there in the repository these are

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,220
just you know simple discussions to have

00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,260
and can make the world of difference to

00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:34,159
where your project is going because when

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:36,320
once it gets easy to get it's that much

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,330
closer to being used by that many more

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:43,010
people lesson 8 if it ain't growing it's

00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,190
dying remember this we're talking about

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:49,760
an organic situation living situation

00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:54,159
and if you aren't seeing new blood in

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:57,470
your project start having some questions

00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,100
if you are not seeing input from your

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:03,140
users start having some questions you

00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,750
know we have to be growing and changing

00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,180
because computing today is not the same

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,010
as computing 10 years ago the use of

00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,990
your project today is probably different

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,120
than your use 10 years ago and will be

00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,600
five years from now look at all the

00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:20,150
stuff going on in cloud this is kind of

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,270
a side thing but now I've been with with

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,100
open source stuff long enough I remember

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,160
the echoes well open source you know

00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,930
that's that's good for imitating

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,940
innovation of others but open source

00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:36,350
does not infinite for that we need

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:38,480
appropriation chicken chips if you don't

00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:43,210
believe that look at the cloud where the

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,210
innovations coming in cloud open source

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,920
frankly that's it and the cloud is

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,080
changing things and the clouds going to

00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,370
change probably most of the projects out

00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,570
there one way or another the way they

00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,480
get used is going to be a bit different

00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,400
five years from now have you thought

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,430
about it if you haven't think about it

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,100
now what do you have to do to make yours

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,930
your project more cloud friendly maybe

00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,990
it's nothing maybe it's a simple road

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,550
but maybe it's huge maybe you need some

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,690
sort of like web-based interface or

00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,210
something like this who knows you know

00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,099
but think about it be aware of these

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,289
things

00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,599
you have to make sure that you are

00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:24,049
constantly moving that you're constantly

00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:26,989
growing say some way shape or form and

00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:28,549
that you're seeing new people because

00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:31,789
we're not seeing new people you have to

00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:35,839
ask the question why is it not

00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:38,959
interesting it's not interesting that's

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,200
not good is it that it's too hard to get

00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:43,729
in the door that's not good either that

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,739
means that you've somehow insulated

00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:49,459
yourself you need to bust open a new

00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:50,329
door and the worst thing is if you're

00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,789
not getting new people they're not

00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:54,950
getting new ideas because people come in

00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:57,200
with a different perspective that's one

00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,900
of the beauties of these things you know

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,390
you come to this you sit in these rooms

00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,479
and you talk to people you've never seen

00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:08,719
before and they're coming from a hugely

00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:10,160
different viewpoint than you and if you

00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,660
sit there and you talk with them long

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,969
enough you start getting ideas you never

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,249
had before because their perspectives

00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:19,479
different that's the beauty about open

00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:21,680
source easily slides aside for a second

00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:23,900
how many people have gone to a

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,209
traditional IT sort of presentation and

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,329
the guy who's wearing a suit that's more

00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:31,509
expensive than my car stands up front

00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:36,920
and says look at what we have gotten

00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:39,049
applause applause to me you know the

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:44,390
adulation and worship shall come to me

00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:47,150
now that is the exact opposite of what

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:51,140
we're doing here truth be told the guy

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:54,190
standing up here isn't the guy he is at

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:58,430
best the orchestra leader for the moment

00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:59,930
you're making the music all the music

00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,709
comes from the other people in these

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:07,039
chairs that's the beauty of open source

00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:11,900
we are what matter as a community not

00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:14,959
the guy up front and if you don't have

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,369
that organic community where people are

00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,499
touching each other and talking to each

00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:20,829
other and finding out what's in their

00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:26,299
heads you're missing something

00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:31,039
mrs. so make sure it's happening lesson

00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:32,809
9 kind of a corollary to eight if you're

00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,249
thinking about what it takes to succeed

00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:36,109
what you want your project to be you

00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:39,019
need to understand where is it going to

00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:43,369
fit you may be the only game in town

00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:45,289
right now like zen was sooner or later

00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:47,660
if it's a really good idea someone's

00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:50,179
going to come along and imitate it and

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,549
they may have more bucks than you they

00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:55,160
may have more marketing savvy than you

00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:57,709
they may have some big-ass corporations

00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,509
sitting behind them and suddenly you're

00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:04,880
in the horse race of your life so it may

00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:08,439
not be possible that your solution will

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,599
be the best solution for every possible

00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:13,189
situation that comes along I'll tell you

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,749
right now if you're going to if you're

00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:17,269
looking at virtualization and what you

00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:20,419
want is a little pop-up window so that

00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:22,640
you can put your skunky little windows

00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:23,749
desktop in it because there's six pieces

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,939
of software in there that your

00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:27,799
corporation requires you to run that

00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:32,029
just won't run under wine or whatever

00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:33,199
and that's why you want virtualization

00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:36,949
you probably don't want to deal with

00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,689
Zanna you might want VirtualBox virtual

00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:41,509
box is real good with that you know pop

00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:43,819
it in load it in there you go and then

00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:45,140
you can you know use your special little

00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:46,549
code and everything is right with the

00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,219
world and then throw it back into the

00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:50,929
bin when you're done or throw it in the

00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:55,509
background and let it home whatever you

00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:58,549
got to do but it's not the right fit

00:39:55,509 --> 00:40:00,859
something like Zen really is designed

00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:03,829
for large engagement that's where it

00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:05,179
shines anyway if you've got a bunch of

00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:10,939
virtualization to do you should be

00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:12,140
looking at Zen if you got 1 Z 2 Z now

00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:13,759
you want to look at something else you

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,969
have to understand that though about

00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:19,489
your project what's your weak point

00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:22,039
what's your strong point who do you need

00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:23,630
to talk to about that strong point so

00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:26,749
that even when something eles bigger and

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,900
noisier and glitzier comes along you

00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:31,130
still have your wedge your place in the

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,530
community because you do something

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,360
better than they do

00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,460
you got to think about that you got to

00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,280
know that so if you haven't done that

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,110
think about it you also have to figure

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,830
out what your users are and what they

00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:47,290
need you know that's just basic but it's

00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:51,400
true you want to succeed you want to

00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:55,500
have a future one of a clicker that

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,730
works lesson 10 competition increases

00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,620
innovation you know there are people at

00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:02,410
say all man you know u Zen guys you must

00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,910
really be sore at kvm you must really

00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,210
hate them you must really hate those red

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,010
hot guys no no no you think we may wish

00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,180
that some people would you know choose a

00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,880
different direction about this or that

00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:15,640
but but in the open source world

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,190
especially when you have multiple people

00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,640
going for a similar goal it's iron

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,290
sharpening iron man it's keeping things

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,690
sharp it's that's where the innovation

00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:28,960
comes from because you got it you know

00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:31,060
you have to do better if you don't have

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,990
the competition you get stagnation how

00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:38,350
many people remember CDE the common

00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:40,120
desktop environment you know I asked the

00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:43,180
same question in Texas last week and I

00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,450
got the same real slow show of hands but

00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:51,580
I just got here you almost don't want to

00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:55,090
admit to it CDE for people who didn't

00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:58,810
see it was a standardized unix windows

00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:02,990
experience they standardized on

00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:11,390
mediocrity it was boozing

00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:14,540
it was and if I can tell a story I knew

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,940
one of the fellows that was one of the

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,430
main architects of X 11 the x window

00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,810
system and I knew one fellow who worked

00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:23,780
very closely with me and this other

00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:26,630
fella told me this story he said you

00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,930
know Jim the guy who worked on X windows

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,060
had this magnificent laughs this room

00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,830
filling laughs you know you get him

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,960
started and it's just the whole room

00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,970
lights up he was just really cool about

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,390
that they threw himself into the X

00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,280
Windows specification he wanted

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,470
something that was powerful he wanted

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,410
something that was visible he wanted

00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:52,460
something that was just going to be just

00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:54,610
gorgeous potential to it and so he put

00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:58,850
his heart and soul into it for years and

00:42:54,610 --> 00:43:03,290
then you know it's coming along on unix

00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:05,270
and then suddenly you have CDE the

00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:13,730
episode of mediocrity just sitting there

00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:16,970
looking my friend said Jim just felt

00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:19,280
disgusted all that hard work all that

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:23,330
terrific thought that went into making

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:29,230
this wonderful powerful tool and this is

00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:31,910
what they build said Jim lost his laugh

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,190
it just seemed like he just didn't have

00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,119
his laughing

00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:39,310
and then Jim went on to other things and

00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:42,099
then in time Linux came along and then

00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:44,079
you had the genome KDE Wars remember

00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:46,000
that from a few years ago and it was

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,069
fighting to see who could make that that

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,290
better that really gorgeous looking

00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:52,119
black the desktop environment the

00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,250
powerful thing and we can do better we

00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:55,390
can do better we can do better and

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,160
someone came and said hey Jim have you

00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:01,150
seen what they're doing with X these

00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,310
days so what do you mean so they plugged

00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:07,119
in a linux disk and they said look at

00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:10,420
your desktop gym and my friend said you

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,670
know what Jim God is laughing he got his

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,079
laugh back because they were using it

00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,849
they're starting to have the idea that

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,400
they could do the stuff that he always

00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:22,780
dreamed that they could do they were

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:28,089
finally tapping into it so if you don't

00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:31,720
have competition wonder you know good

00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:35,740
ideas green competition they do so be

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:39,640
ready for it and when it comes embrace

00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:41,680
it it's the call to the race man this is

00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,700
the chance to go further than you are

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,730
that you already are so be aware of that

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:51,790
it keeps the ball moving zens

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:55,240
competition with kbm vmware has pushed

00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:57,400
the hypervisor ball along tremendously

00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,890
because each of us are trying to do

00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,339
better than the other guy it keeps the

00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:06,490
ball moving it's good and it keeps the

00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:09,329
project sharp because you can get dull

00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:11,920
in a hurry man rest on your own laurels

00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:17,680
so embrace that competition when it

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:20,290
comes to 11 new features you know we

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,900
don't think about it two minutes real

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,790
quick new features are real important

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,210
because if you're not having new

00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:31,230
features I thought we had till the top

00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,230
of the hour am I mistaken

00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:44,050
okay okay well let me let me take celery

00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,700
new features you don't think about that

00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,390
being important but that's part of the

00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,530
heartbeat that tells people you're alive

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,740
if you're not creating something new

00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:59,020
then it's like you must be old new

00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:01,630
things are important I want to get into

00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,450
12 here real quick and sometimes

00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:06,490
perception really is reality you know

00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,260
that's hard for tech guys like us to

00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:11,650
consider we think of things the real

00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,660
things are the bits but someone comes

00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:17,770
along said well you know your your pass

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:20,290
a your old hat you have to change that

00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,270
because otherwise that becomes the truth

00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:24,640
whether you believe it or not you don't

00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,830
believe that move up to DC where I am

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,560
man there's a whole thing of cult of

00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:33,880
perception is reality it's scary is crap

00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:36,040
for a technical guy but it's true so you

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,830
have to be ready to stand up and fight

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,190
when it comes your way as an aside kvm

00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:45,610
Red Hat kvm IBM when all that came down

00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:49,630
and red-hot bought kumrah net which was

00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:51,400
doing kvm they did it right they managed

00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,060
the perception why because they were

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,800
doing the right things they did it right

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,710
and now you don't have people saying

00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,380
okay BM that's our that's a red hat red

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,300
hat owned thing no it's out there it's a

00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,770
project they are shepherding it along

00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:10,960
correctly it's important that the open

00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:15,640
source world see that you're doing it

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,530
correctly and that is perception this

00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,570
slide spend time with this slide when

00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,310
you see it on the deck because I don't

00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:25,960
have time to go over it now but you can

00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:28,740
do a whole lot shoot your mouth off at

00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,870
places like this about your project oh

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,090
speaking is hard no no calculus was hard

00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:37,300
engineering was hard speaking you had

00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,130
mastered by the age of five you're just

00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,710
not used to doing it in front of people

00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,880
get used to it it's not that

00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,079
because if you're gonna especially if

00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,079
you're gonna make a fool eat up make it

00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:51,710
fool yourself in front of your friends

00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:55,579
you know other people like you do it

00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:56,900
it's not that hard get an or glue that

00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:59,329
you know these little that these

00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,789
regional shows sometimes they're free

00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:03,259
sometimes you know fifty bucks Cuban

00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:07,160
have a bake sale for crying out loud

00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:08,869
fill it with you know CDs God people

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,880
love the cds you can do them for cheap

00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:12,920
you know business cards you go to

00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,960
vistaprint get 100 million bits of

00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,950
business cards for five dollars or

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,150
whatever that or whatever they're doing

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:23,690
you know that stuff's easy a website

00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:25,970
blogs pennies man that's a spending the

00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,970
time to do it podcast go to legs link

00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,769
tech show great people over there and

00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,240
even if they've never heard you if they

00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:33,519
if you got something interesting on the

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,839
web and say can you give me 10 minutes

00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,759
some Wednesday night to talk about it

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,480
chances are they'll do it if it looks

00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:44,059
cool a whole new outlet for you so and

00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,210
then of course the whole social media

00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:48,950
thing demos and tutorials you know

00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,180
youtube videos when you're talking about

00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:52,099
something that users are going to use

00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,900
you may think it's the worst thing in

00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,789
the world it's the greatest thing since

00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,740
sliced bread as far as a lot of those

00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:59,900
people are concerned get yourself a cool

00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,140
mascot but what we got dibs on the Panda

00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:10,279
and just shout out live or shut up and

00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:12,470
die man talk about it and the final

00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:14,630
thing is that you have to work this

00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:16,579
corporate connection if you have a

00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,920
corporation that's dealing with you you

00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:21,049
must understand what are you doing what

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,710
are they doing what do what do each one

00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:26,470
expect from the other and it's going to

00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,240
look different in just about every case

00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,859
so you have to have a grip on that

00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,730
situation if you're living with that

00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:36,230
situation and you have to manage that

00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,460
relationship between business and the

00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:41,539
project because man if your project

00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:44,000
looks owned almost in the cracker sort

00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:46,230
of sense if it looks owned people back

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,170
away from

00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:52,140
you need to have that proper respect

00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:55,050
distance understanding not simple but

00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:58,920
very important and if you don't have it

00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:02,040
that image may become reality for you

00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:06,180
but it's not right and suddenly you

00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,250
become on right so you have to have that

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,080
symbiotic relationship otherwise you can

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,900
end up in a fake open source situation

00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,170
there is a portal that my last job that

00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,540
was nominally open source so great we'll

00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,720
use this then we went to try to hire a

00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,910
couple contractors to do stuff trying to

00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,890
find someone who either didn't wear the

00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,650
badge of the company behind that portal

00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,210
or hadn't recently worn a badge of the

00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,560
company behind that portal almost

00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:36,690
impossible because they weren't dealing

00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,190
with it as an open source community they

00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,270
were dealing with it like closed source

00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,490
and then kind of throwing it over the

00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:43,170
wall so suddenly you wanted anything

00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:45,480
done you had to go to that company or

00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:49,320
someone who was you know an alumnus of

00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:52,520
that company that's not the way it's

00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,390
supposed to be that's not why we're here

00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,760
so make sure you've got that

00:50:54,390 --> 00:51:00,390
relationship correct final thoughts

00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,859
because we're out of time here is your

00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,869
code good you're reaching out to your

00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:06,390
users is the development community

00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:08,700
active engaged in growing are you

00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:11,900
reaching out here laterally to other

00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:14,369
people inside the open source community

00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:18,060
you have you worked with your your

00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:20,310
libraries and support system is that

00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:23,040
corporate entity if there is one is that

00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:26,010
relationship really healthy are there

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:32,040
healthy lines between them and whatever

00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:34,320
you do don't give up don't give up Zen

00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,119
had some big hurdles to come to overcome

00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,880
we've done some great things and we're

00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,590
continuing to go forward you don't have

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,650
to go this direction and if you're

00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:45,600
having problems solve them we're geeks

00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:48,619
we're used to solving problems just

00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,619
recognize them and solve

00:51:49,570 --> 00:52:11,900
questions inside the remaining three and

00:51:52,130 --> 00:52:16,450
a half minutes okay yeah I don't know if

00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,450
there's a we basically author

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:29,860
oh yeah but I don't have that support

00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:34,420
you guys are coming back you're putting

00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:36,300
effort what kind of other projects going

00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,020
to help me be able to my great thanks

00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,880
now that I have this infrastructure

00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,890
where I'm using version libvirt and what

00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,480
not and okay so now you have Colonel

00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:48,430
support but what about the other tools

00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,900
and things I probably want to talk to

00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,730
you a little bit offline here so if we

00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:55,030
don't tie it up too much but we actually

00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:56,500
do have support for rubber slipper it's

00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,570
not quite as good as some other tools

00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:03,670
tax but we have multiple tools to talk

00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:05,290
about that on Sunday too but yeah let me

00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,540
let me take you off long as that's a

00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:09,820
little on specific site but yeah we we

00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,890
also have just so people know we go to

00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:14,290
Zen project or you got the mailing lists

00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,270
we've got the IRC channels you got all

00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:19,750
that QA infrastructure all the things

00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:21,250
that you're expecting I'm hoping for we

00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,540
have and if you don't see something we

00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:25,060
have let us know and we'll get it

00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:28,960
because that's the way things like this

00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:33,670
have to be answered but you sir well um

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:37,330
oh nice dangerous what would you say

00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:39,190
then is a very hardware level oriented

00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:41,020
company on this side have you reached

00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:43,360
out to your hardware vendors on that

00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,820
side or people on that side or even

00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,950
conversely on the software side building

00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,210
into the cloud stacks like OpenStack and

00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,430
working with cloudstack any other

00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:53,350
vendors so your integrated i already

00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:56,050
amazon cloud for you did you do to that

00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:57,670
yeah there's guys we've done some of

00:53:56,050 --> 00:54:00,250
that we're doing more I mean the

00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,900
cloudstack guys in fact a couple of the

00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,910
cloud sack evangelists that you'll see

00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,830
here at this show are technically in the

00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:08,740
same group I am so I mean we

00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:10,930
occasionally like have lunch but beyond

00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,190
that you know there is to reach out to

00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,590
OpenStack there is to reach out to

00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:18,250
cloudstack that is we're very mindful of

00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:20,410
that stuff now on the hardware side I am

00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:24,250
will touch on this Sunday things like

00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:26,260
the ARM arm architecture there is a real

00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:29,620
interesting lot of work going on there

00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,330
and you know really a hand in glove fit

00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,010
between Zen architecture and arm

00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:35,950
architecture that turns out

00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:37,600
and you know if you ever seen a ever see

00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:39,490
a geek get real excited about

00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,780
architecture man that I was the guy was

00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,130
talking with who was doing a lot of this

00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,690
work he said this is this is fantastic

00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,700
it looks like they're designed for each

00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:47,890
other and that as a result we're going

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,530
to happen we have and we continue to

00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:52,720
develop a nice tight integration between

00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:55,240
the two but yeah we are mindful that in

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,280
fact we're part of linaro I think we

00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,470
just announced which is you know part of

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,480
the armed group so I mean we are trying

00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:04,060
to work with that certainly in in our

00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:08,110
side to AMD and Intel are both on board

00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:12,790
with the Zen project as far as you know

00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:14,710
backing members so yes we're trying if

00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,010
you are representing someone that we

00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:21,190
should be reaching out to and we're not

00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:22,930
let us here because we're we're mindful

00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,390
doing it may not be doing it perfectly

00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:28,210
but sure yeah absolutely we want to be

00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:30,430
part of the game let's see I think we

00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:35,710
got like 30 seconds or something left

00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:36,970
any other questions or issues want to

00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,280
thank you all for coming for staying

00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,020
awake for being here for rending an arc

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,540
or whatever it took for you to get here

00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:49,380
in all the rain I hope you'll come back

00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:49,380
to the talk on Sunday have a good show

00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:06,390
prospects I every way this is the way to

00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:08,340
better utilize all your resources and it

00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,400
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:16,260
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:19,590
in open source the collaborative nature

00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,050
and of the you know of the community and

00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,850
then the speed at which these are these

00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,590
you know these these deficiencies these

00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:28,380
bugs are getting discovered and then

00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:30,330
fixed is it like that really shows the

00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,060
power of the you know of the open source

00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:35,240
community it is global and it's

00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:38,760
definitely because of the users

00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:44,760
community people are extremely friendly

00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:46,470
and always ready to help if you go on

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,660
tire see any day you'll see these guys

00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:51,300
helping each other out and they're all

00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:53,010
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:56,000
product is transparent for everyone

00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:58,950
everyone can look at the code base

00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,660
everyone can see how close darkest is

00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:06,540
being built nothing nothing is

00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:09,180
proprietary everything is open in many

00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:13,380
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:17,160
ongoing health cloudstack the most

00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:21,029
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:23,699
was our first developer boot camp

00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:26,339
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:30,299
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:34,469
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:37,319
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:39,839
chairs into the room twice everything

00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:43,199
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:46,169
is open source and so I don't think that

00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,939
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:50,969
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:53,519
computing and so i think it's i think

00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:55,019
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,159
about cloud computing you're really

00:57:55,019 --> 00:58:01,679
talking about open source cloud

00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:04,739
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,869
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:11,130
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:13,799
in each data centers these hardware is

00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:17,309
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:20,009
to handle number one that mass scale

00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:23,189
number two it's designed to handle the

00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:26,009
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:30,239
deployments started working on cod tech

00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:33,509
over four years ago and it was the

00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:35,279
original set of people working on it had

00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:39,390
a background of delivering software

00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:43,619
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:47,249
lots of users actually using it high

00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:50,339
availability is a key feature multiple

00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:52,499
hypervisors support different network

00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:55,499
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:58:52,499 --> 00:58:57,269
better while step management server can

00:58:55,499 --> 00:59:00,959
be deployed in different physical

00:58:57,269 --> 00:59:02,640
machines it definitely has a huge

00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:07,619
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:10,199
there's a major movie studio that they

00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:13,499
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:15,479
to transcode video and i thought that

00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:17,130
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:20,400
more fascinating is what they did during

00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:23,189
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,539
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:59:23,189 --> 00:59:25,160
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:28,430
the instance

00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,980
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:32,750
vast it touches so many different

00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:34,609
aspects and there's no one person that's

00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:38,000
kind of like a master of all those

00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:41,150
realms I think CloudStack as a project

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,430
is going to be one of the leaders simply

00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:48,530
because it's some of the most feature

00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:52,579
fallen and and robust platforms out they

00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:55,119
were Adam senior living through the

00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:55,119
clouds dag

01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,000
you

01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:18,380
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,329
ago we could not have imagined that

01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,550
asterisk would not only become the most

01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:24,680
widely adopted open source communication

01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:26,720
software on the planet but that it would

01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,240
impact the entire industry in the way

01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,220
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,859
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:35,810
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:37,880
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:39,319
transition of power from the hands of

01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,569
the traditional proprietary phone

01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:43,970
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:45,920
administrators of phone systems using

01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,150
this power our customers have created

01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,099
all sorts of business changing

01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,930
applications from small office phone

01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,450
systems to mission-critical call centres

01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:55,069
to international carrier networks in

01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,839
fact there's even an entire country

01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:59,240
those communications infrastructure runs

01:00:56,839 --> 01:01:01,369
on esters the gym has always been about

01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,079
creating technology that expands

01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:05,240
communications capabilities in ways that

01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:06,440
we could never have imagined and that's

01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,839
part of what's game-changing about

01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,540
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:13,640
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,740
IP phones that extends control of the

01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,510
user all the way to the desktop the

01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,220
launch of these new products represents

01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,319
the next phase indigenous history of

01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,720
innovation these are the first and only

01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:25,430
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,960
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:29,030
our expectations for building a family

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,160
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,900
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,520
the team to build the phones such that

01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,740
they were easy to install integrate

01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,569
provision in use I think you'll soon

01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:41,150
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:42,770
that goal user feedback is validating

01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,900
that when it comes to operation with

01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:47,300
astro space systems including our own

01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,880
Switchvox based product these are the

01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,200
easiest to use best integrated most

01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,780
interoperable products on the market

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,780
today the digitally phones will

01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,829
initially include three IP des hommes

01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:59,780
uniquely designed to complement any

01:01:57,829 --> 01:02:01,640
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:04,310
these phones are different for a number

01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,950
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:08,390
designed for use with esters secondly

01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:10,000
we've made it really easy to

01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:12,380
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,089
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,770
to access information inside of

01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:18,040
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:20,000
between an application and the

01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,160
additionally we've created an

01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,290
applications engine that allows users

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,530
and developers to create and run their

01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:29,300
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:31,250
done all of this at a very compelling

01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,930
price point at digium we're always

01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:35,030
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:37,550
the best value in business phone systems

01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:39,260
and also give them the power to create

01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,300
their own solutions or eating

01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:43,010
communications challenge will continue

01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,420
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:46,490
Astra's cooler faster more

01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:48,109
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:50,600
asterisk and what communications even

01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:54,310
easier and together we'll change the way

01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,310
the world communicates again

01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:05,880
your customers rely on your website or

01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,250
application if it's slower

01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:11,190
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:13,020
and costs you money keeping your

01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:16,520
business critical systems humming along

01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:18,830
requires insight into what they're doing

01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,810
your system metrics tells stories

01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,820
stories that can reveal performance

01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:25,130
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:26,690
other problems but how do you keep an

01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:29,360
eye on all of your systems performance

01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:32,360
metrics in real-time and record this

01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:34,130
data for later analysis enter longview

01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,170
the new way to see what's really going

01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:38,300
on under the hood the long view

01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:40,370
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,830
of all your systems providing you with a

01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:46,220
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:48,800
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:50,540
load and network usage click a specific

01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,940
system to access its individual

01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:55,450
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:57,860
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:59,540
comprehensive network data including

01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,850
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,410
available on the network tab and disk

01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:05,330
rights and free space on the disk

01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:08,180
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:10,700
displays usage statistics for individual

01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:12,890
processes the system info tab shows

01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:15,140
listening services active connections

01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,270
and available updates adding long view

01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,950
to a system is easy just click the

01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:21,110
button copy the one line installation

01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:23,540
command then run the command on your

01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:25,250
linux system to complete the process the

01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:27,440
agent will begin collecting data and

01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:29,280
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,830
start rolling

01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,200
used longview to gain visibility into

01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:37,940
your servers so when your website or app

01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,940
heats up it stays up

01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:24,020
most enterprises today realize that

01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:25,670
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,040
enough to keep their networks saved from

01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:30,110
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,150
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:34,280
popular lately that adds that extra

01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:36,950
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:38,720
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:40,910
know is that some two-factor

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,130
authentication solutions they're better

01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:46,190
than others like two-factor strong

01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:48,440
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:50,420
beyond other authentication systems by

01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,690
being less expensive easier to implement

01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:55,940
and easier to use getting software based

01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,790
token clients built to run on all major

01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:01,390
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:03,740
Android these tokens utilize a

01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,960
public/private key combination that's

01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:08,090
generated and on device so there aren't

01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:10,610
any shared secrets flying around or

01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:13,460
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:15,320
special handling instead all keys are

01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:17,810
kept secure and private between the

01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:20,000
requesting token and your server which

01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:21,610
you control in house making it the most

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,290
secure way possible to perform

01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:27,080
authentication encryption and with an

01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:29,870
extensive flexible API and support for

01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:31,850
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:34,040
works with any enterprise network
