the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,769
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,740
possible ok this is bring your own pc i

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:37,170
am ben francis and this is the ninth of

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:41,070
jun 2013 at southeast linux fest and we

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,010
got a nice cozy group here so we can

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:50,750
tailor the debt the presentation to what

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,750
to Roger wants to hear and your name sir

00:00:51,170 --> 00:01:02,760
Klaatu okay and to what Klaatu wants to

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:04,589
wants to hear also so BYOP see maybe i

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,229
miss named this presentation because

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,700
it's maybe it should be bring your own

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,960
laptop because that's really who it's

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,010
tailored for and what to what got me

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,540
thinking about this is that i've been

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:22,080
doing net building for a long time for

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,640
the military and recently retired from

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,340
the military work at bluecross

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,740
blueshield right now just started with

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,090
them and but the net booting is my

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,369
specialty and i started thinking about

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,380
this and said well you know for large

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:40,079
organizations that want to protect their

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,450
information and also protect their

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,820
employees for and protect their own

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,689
infrastructure from stuff that employees

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,930
want to bring in you know is it's a

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:55,740
difficult trick and gartner just came

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,930
out with an article just a like a month

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,649
ago or couple weeks ago saying that most

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,930
corporations are going or the majority

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,369
of corporations are going to require

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,830
bring your own device by 2017 who knows

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,010
that's going to play out but the idea is

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,230
out there and

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:20,890
well you know this is this is one way to

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:26,650
do bring your own device and this so I'm

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:30,040
going to show that and I'm not hptm and

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,650
then or any of the great other great net

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,470
booters out there but I have figured out

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,810
how to boot from a web server and and

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,099
i'm going to show you that here today

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,170
and just the solution that I figured out

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:47,620
the reason for why a company would like

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,690
to like you to bring your own laptop to

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,909
work is obviously because they don't

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,159
have to pay for it but they do have to

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,319
worry about the viruses that you're

00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,069
going to bring into the workplace

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,970
especially if you run windows put up but

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:08,170
I don't have a drummer nation that would

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,819
have been where he does that and so but

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,639
first of all employees like their own

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,620
laptops and if their power users so like

00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,540
people in this room that you're going to

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,150
be running your favorite operating

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,699
system and you really don't want to have

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,949
to switch back to a nut the work the

00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:26,560
work laptop or the work desktop just

00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:29,260
just to get your work done because it is

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,790
kind of a mental thing when you're

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,129
having to switch and go into work mode

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,310
and then you know switch to go back to

00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:43,480
your to your laptop I can get anything

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:45,879
done mode ok so the pxe has a has a

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,060
history what is it PhD stands for a

00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,120
pre-boot execution environment it was a

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,280
specification invented by Intel in the

00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:02,470
late 90s and the initial implementations

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,060
of pxe left a lot to be desired the the

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,430
main part being that they're they're

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,859
tftp implementations were all buggy and

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,079
sometimes they just they would work on

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,389
some devices and network on others and

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,590
it was just it was just kind of a big

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:19,570
mess so it was a propriety it was an

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:23,580
open specification but everybody

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,480
implemented it in a proprietary way so I

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,880
left a lot

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,410
desired for you know we just we're just

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,350
going to design this to work on just on

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,610
our our chipset in our laptop and you

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:39,310
know nobody else's so we don't have to

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:42,610
worry about everyone else well that led

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:46,180
to ether boot org or the ether boot

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:50,560
project either mood has its own open

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:55,600
source project to manage all this stuff

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:59,830
in that that led to GP XE g PX e is the

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:04,060
open-source version of PX e or pre-boot

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,280
execution vironment this is what this

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,990
this is the the version the version of

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,910
the program that loads right after right

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,860
after the bios runs so it grew out of

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,500
the ether group project and give us a

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:26,520
whole lot of new protocols that that we

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:30,610
can use protocols like HTTP I scuzzy AoE

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,940
what else a a fibre channel all this

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:38,280
stuff came out of the GPA the GPX he

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,420
project so it allows you to boot from a

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,250
web server like i'm going to show you

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,200
not only that but you could boot off a

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:51,430
storage area network and support all the

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,710
machines that you want okay so a little

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,240
bit about the the pogoplug that that you

00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,490
see on the desk over there I'll just

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,730
have any wires show you what the

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,070
pogoplug is this is the pogoplug and

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,540
I'll get back into camera view so in

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:14,770
case the camera was just on me that is

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,870
just a $25 box i bought on amazon it

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,380
used to be the version of the pogoplug

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:23,380
before the penguin came out but I happen

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,590
to get lucky and that Ellen actually has

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,440
the furrow she on easier to processor in

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,380
which is the normal processor for most

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,180
of the pink polka plugs so you know

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,080
sometimes you get lucky they were just

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,460
channel stuffing in

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,880
just happened to get lucky and got a

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:45,090
good good machine but anyway that

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,630
machine is running arch linux arch linux

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,930
is a distribution of linux tailored for

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,990
small machines just enough to get you by

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,810
and of course modular and allows you to

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,640
load a whole bunch of stuff the the

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:04,020
package manager that comes with arch is

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:10,320
called pac-man and it works a lot like

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:14,010
yum and app get under the Debian side or

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,950
aptitude so it so it's very good

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:21,060
distribution work with you have to SSH

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,470
into the into the box that to operate

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,350
because obviously it doesn't have a

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,010
doesn't have a monitor or anything it's

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:34,110
just got a ethernet port and for us be

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:39,840
four USB ports and that's it sir I'm

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:44,300
sorry I'm going to cover that yes great

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:48,230
question to answer it right off the bat

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,480
Angie pixie is is chain loaded from the

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:57,510
the regular pxe distribution on your lap

00:07:51,480 --> 00:08:00,900
on a laptop so you can have G pixie just

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,880
on a wrong card say I could burn it to

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,830
this laptop right here but let's say

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,570
let's say I don't want to take that risk

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,180
you know I know pixie works with this

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,190
laptop right here there's a there's a

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,280
technique called chain loading where you

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,470
can tell the laptop say ok boot from the

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,400
network because I know you got pxe and

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:29,400
then the network says oh you got pxe you

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:31,380
need I pixie which is oh ok I GPX see I

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,760
thought I had a slide for it but I don't

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,590
but the next slide should have been

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,130
should have said I pixie and said I

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,860
pixie is the new g of g p XE g PX e

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:44,099
hasn't been updated since 2011 has had

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,040
one one commits an action in exactly two

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,830
years and all the developers from GPX ii

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,940
have

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,550
I pixie and the reason is is social the

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,320
person that owns ether booth Oregon and

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:01,180
GPX sea org he doesn't want to give

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,130
anything up and he's very he's

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:12,040
apparently is a very controlling type

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:15,610
person so now it's I pixie yes sir chain

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:19,180
loading yes it's a Chandler so pxe loads

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,970
I pixie and then I pixie lows and says

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:27,220
okay the real I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:29,980
get into it and we saw that about the

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,350
pogoplug all right yeah here we go the

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,150
network boot process so bugging the

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,430
laptop you change your BIOS to boot from

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:42,580
the network and usually your laptop is

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,470
not is configured to boot from probably

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,390
the CD first and then and then the hard

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:50,470
drive you want to change the order of

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:53,560
that to say there'll be a land boot at

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,790
the bottom or pxe boot different

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,120
manufacturers call it a different

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:01,210
different thing but just make sure that

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,920
your your bio says boot from the network

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,220
before the hard drive or else it's going

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,630
to load linux or windows or whatever

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,820
operating system you have on a hard

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:15,640
drive okay so pxe starts the adult in

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,310
this case the old pixie from the old

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,460
pixie proprietary one that came with a

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:24,250
laptop it asks for a dhcp server because

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,170
it doesn't it doesn't know it all it

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,090
knows is that it's got a mac address and

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,640
that's it so it says I I need an IP

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,800
address and each and the dhcp server

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,270
that you have configured says oh you

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:41,290
need I pick C and then it gives it I

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:44,910
pixie and then it loads that I pick

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:48,460
Seelos up then says the dhcp services

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:51,370
okay what do you want and he says well I

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,220
needed operating system I beg z says

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,830
okay well you need vmlinux and then it

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,910
does a little switches you know here we

00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,910
go how does it know

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,990
the DHB server is the one that the size

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,180
says if you if you don't have I pixie

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,290
i'm going to give you I pixie if you

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:15,280
have I pixie then load vm lynus and this

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:17,890
initial ram disk and this is exactly how

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,410
it looks on the boot line two if you're

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,290
running grub it'll say in it rd it will

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,530
say load vm lettuce and then the Annette

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:30,340
our d-line is specifying the initial ram

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:32,860
disk will have root equals dev RAM RAM

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,800
disk block size of 4096 and then the r

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:41,980
and s size is some huge number in this

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:46,510
case it's 300 and 340 megabyte ram disk

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,980
size and that's needed because that that

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,900
last line right there was the magic

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,780
sauce that got me over the hump and

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,750
actually got this version of Linux to

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:59,920
load and I've been playing with this for

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:04,180
a couple years now so that's the magic

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,700
sauce right there dns mass i'm going to

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:11,140
talk about this a little bit because you

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:16,120
have to have a tftp server and anna web

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:19,510
server okay Anna dhcp server dns mass

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:23,200
actually functions as both the tftp

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:26,560
server a dhcp server in a dns kasher so

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,990
all that stuff is loaded right on the

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,820
the pogoplug in arch linux itself and

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,560
we're going to see how this shakes out

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,850
in the demo that I want that i'm going

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,500
to do so dns masters is a very nice

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,830
implementation of combining two

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,050
technologies that you're going to need

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:48,790
it's probably not robust enough for

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,950
booting thousand clients at the same

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,720
time so in that case he would have to

00:12:50,950 --> 00:13:00,970
use a tftp server by H Peter and VIN

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:05,110
called tftp HP a HP a saying for an H

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,420
Peter MN but there's also a way you

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,130
could do it with a microsoft dhcp server

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,130
also it's a different set of procedures

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:19,019
alright so that's how you boot from the

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:22,050
network now if you're not inside your

00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,790
network how is that going to work if

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,709
you're at a hotel room or something and

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,720
you and you say well you know I really

00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:31,649
like that that that set up that work

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,480
gave me for you know just having a real

00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,339
light distribution that I can use to the

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,709
browser web and not worry about security

00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,839
or anything like that how would you

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:44,990
manage that well in that case you would

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:49,410
give your employee a CD or a USB stick

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:52,499
that you have boot that has the same vm

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,509
linis and the same initial ram disk but

00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:57,660
it's on the US it was just it's just on

00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:00,689
the USB and in this case since you've

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,220
loaded the all the instructions for you

00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:04,470
know whether he's got out you've already

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,230
loaded I pixie on the USB you don't have

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:14,759
to do that dhcp trick where you switch

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:17,420
from pxe to I pixie so let's say that I

00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,379
cover all that I pixie is already on it

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,499
you boot the computer for them some

00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:26,249
drive and peter gets to move house from

00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:29,040
the company's web server the computer

00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:32,029
gets the boot files from the company web

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,339
server so you could have your company's

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:37,529
you know play distribution for just

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,449
going in accessing the web you could

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:42,029
have it on linode somewhere somewhere in

00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:45,749
the cloud as long as it's a web server

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:48,509
and you've got those two files v mls and

00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:50,610
in the initial ramdisk on that web

00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:53,839
server it's going to find it because

00:14:50,610 --> 00:15:00,480
you've told this USB stick that it's at

00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:02,910
you know 20 dot 4221 that's 68 and it

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,720
will find it so this this is a good way

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,519
to give a USB thumb drive or CD to your

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,740
employees say okay if you want to surf

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,240
securely and make sure that none of your

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,429
stuff is getting to the hard drive and

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,540
none of the none of the viruses on the

00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:21,360
on the hotel's desktop computer is

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,720
getting to your USB stick this is the

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,720
way to do it

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,480
okay yeah the references where did I get

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,269
all this stuff I got a whole bunch of it

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,110
from I pixie org which was the old jeep

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:39,870
exe org the net boot many people are

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,360
great they they came out in about two

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:48,149
thousand nine with a distribution based

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:51,839
on based on the kernel.org boot

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:56,250
kernel.org people John warthog nine

00:15:51,839 --> 00:16:00,720
holly was one of the main instigators

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:03,810
behind that effort unfortunately is the

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,720
the kernel.org server got hacked last

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:10,230
last year and it's dead dead dead right

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,060
now so that's why I don't have them up

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,250
there otherwise i would mention them but

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,519
if you went to boot kernel.org right now

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,839
it'd be just I don't know what that is

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,190
then spi that DOD that mill is the

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,779
distribution that we're going to load

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:31,440
right now it's it is a DoD website but

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,690
they publicly publish a version of Linux

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,519
that everybody can use and it's pretty

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,699
cool it's a small distribution of length

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,490
about you know when i start with it was

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:44,070
about 130 megabytes and now it's about

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,110
it's a little over 200 now but it still

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,970
loads in a decent amount of time over a

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,399
gigabit network that you wouldn't note

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,350
you would notice it from a regular hard

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,370
drive boot and you're going to see that

00:16:52,350 --> 00:17:00,930
when we when we do the demo right here

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:03,510
corbeau org is notable for they are the

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:07,520
people that are creating open source

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:12,169
boot firmware to replace the proprietary

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:15,799
biases and the proprietary UEFI firmware

00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:19,319
that is currently coming out with with

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,140
today's laptops in fact there's been a

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:25,589
lot of discussion that you know it is

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:28,079
Microsoft using UEFI to try lock linux

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:32,429
distributions out of being loaded on a

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,230
on a regular laptop and that is the case

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,140
with with many laptops that are coming

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,730
out there right now so coreboot is an

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,190
effort to kind of science that that and

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,250
say okay let's just have everything out

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,919
and open instead of having proprietary

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,950
biases and proprietary you fees loading

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,919
to open operating systems let's just

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,260
start you know from let's start open

00:17:52,919 --> 00:18:04,820
from square one and that's what coreboot

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:07,169
is all about ok so let's want to move

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,720
that's the end of the PowerPoint stuff

00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:17,429
so and I want to be able to configure

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:21,919
this uh I got a crazy laptop where I

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:26,549
can't see the pointer okay here we go

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,769
I'm going to try to mirror the display

00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:31,250
setting so that you can see exactly what

00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:31,250
I'm seeing

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:46,620
as this will come back in a second and

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:53,180
then we'll go ahead and so we don't want

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:57,270
to keep it yes all right good good

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,070
bye-bye and so what I'm going to do is

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,620
I'm going to use this laptop right here

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,870
as the test laptop so all this stuff and

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,510
the presentation is going to go away

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:11,010
this is Harper he was a detective chief

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:16,820
technology officer for the for the Obama

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,820
the reelect Obama campaign sorry Jeremy

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,420
but he gave one heck of an awesome

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:27,950
demonstrate of presentation at paz con a

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,360
couple months ago in Colombia and it so

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,440
you know get rid of the politics or

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,160
everything what this guy had to do to to

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,170
get the Obama campaign get to work out

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,440
it was just amazing he hired 50

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:46,230
developers and put in in three months

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,970
and you know I asked him well how in the

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,930
world did you make sure one of those

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:56,580
guys wasn't a mall and he said I hired

00:19:51,930 --> 00:20:00,930
from friends okay all right that's one

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:03,390
way to do it so anyway I'm a big fan vez

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,940
obviously I got his mug on my desktop

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:10,470
but let's go ahead and and do the

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:15,600
rebooting and we will see how our little

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:18,570
tiny little web server can serve as how

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:27,770
we can boot from a web server so shut

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:32,250
down restart I guess I did I'm listen uh

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:36,210
cancel and school oh we started up

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,570
another one yeah yeah look at that this

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,570
card

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:51,560
well yeah thank you 12 for not telling

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,030
me exactly what's going on all right you

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,020
start again yes I really do want to

00:20:53,030 --> 00:21:02,120
restart okay good so what we're

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:03,950
expecting here is for the the pxe

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,440
version that came with a laptop to load

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:16,480
and it's going to it's going to chain

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:18,560
load right into the I pixie version of

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,780
pre-boot execution environment here we

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,060
go it's on my laptop you're not seeing

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,250
how are there you go okay so down at the

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:29,660
bottom here you can see it loaded boot

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:33,650
dot PHP pH it's just a web file that has

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,510
to has a little menu in it says okay go

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:39,110
ahead and load vm lenis and then load

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,020
the initial ram disk and you can see the

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,970
the initial ram disk is is kind of a

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,550
huge file it's like two hundred megabyte

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,930
it's greater than 200 megabytes and it's

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,880
sloping pretty quickly I mean this is

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,710
this is about what you would expect from

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,590
my hard drive okay now here's the fun

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,840
stuff here is Linux song loading quick

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,120
quick quick fast fast fast redo Lex all

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:04,430
right here we go

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,040
and bam okay we're here just say yes to

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:11,140
the user agreement and this is

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:13,970
lightweight portable security from oh

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,280
there okay here we go this is

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:21,650
lightweight portable security from the

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:24,980
DoD Department of Defense the party is

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,920
almost exclusively a window shop on an

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,809
army side anyway the Navy plays a lot

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,790
with linux and this is actually a

00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,770
product of the Air Force they have a

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,179
small little lab that says okay we're

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,370
going to we're going to see what we can

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,740
do with linux and this is one of the

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,520
distributions they've done and it's kind

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,200
of neat they instead of a window they

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,720
made it on a windows theme right here

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,580
I'm going to get the cursor over here

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,090
and instead of the windows logo they

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:57,020
replace it with a penguin hard to see

00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,140
from back there sorry Jeremy but a

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,179
couple of features that there are

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:07,280
notable is has got a little encryption

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:10,580
wizard pull that up and you can drag

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:15,080
drag and drop files in here and it'll do

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,940
the encrypted for you another major

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,980
feature of this distribution of linux is

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,350
that it doesn't have any drivers in it

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,760
whatsoever that that talk two hard

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:27,410
drives okay so even if you wanted you

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,090
know the hack on a hard drive or

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,290
something it being possible because it

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,340
just it just doesn't have the drivers

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:38,990
that's what keeps the distribution lean

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:43,070
and mean it's based on a version of thin

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:48,800
station to point to point to point one I

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:51,200
believe thin station came out about 2005

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,250
his it's it's a good good ol

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,740
distribution very configurable and it's

00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,270
it's a hacker distribution but this one

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:04,100
I didn't have to hack at all all i did

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:07,390
was was was get the the CD image 44

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,390
lightweight portable security

00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:15,549
pull it up in a it was just the iso file

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:17,799
pulled it up in an archive manager saw

00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:21,070
the two files for vm lettuce and the

00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,860
initial ram disk and just said ok what

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,509
happens if i take those things out and

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:30,399
put them on the network and see if i can

00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:32,679
boot from well the short story is that i

00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:35,019
couldn't at first until I figured out

00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:39,879
that I needed to make the the initial

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:42,070
ram disk size a lot larger than you know

00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,230
10 megabytes or whatever whatever the

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,639
initial value was because what it wasn't

00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,850
it would definitely wasn't like in the

00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:50,200
130 Meg in RAM disk that was pulling

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,250
down and we're trying to pull down at

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,340
the time soon as I bumped that up to 300

00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:01,029
Meg as a ram Desai's than everything's

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,730
running swimmingly notice also that this

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:07,929
kind of a distribution is running

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:11,379
entirely in RAM no swap no nothing like

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:13,809
that is just all running and ram so is

00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:17,649
it's as fast as it as a distribution can

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:22,899
run and you got your you got your

00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:24,490
firefox normal stuff there is a version

00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:27,850
of this distribution that has open

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:31,029
office with it also but also that that

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:37,840
causes the files to get bigger by about

00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:42,000
100 and about 150 megabytes so I chose I

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,000
just chose them the lighter one case

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:50,169
just to make the presentation shorter ok

00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:52,720
so that is enough about lightweight

00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,460
portable security again as built it was

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,720
built off with penn station so if you

00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:00,009
wanted to do something like this and

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,559
your organization as you know i just

00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:06,610
want a web be able to give my employees

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,259
a web browser and maybe a small ball

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,080
shooter i want to give them open office

00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:14,360
and all that then you could do that it's

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,700
just the enabling options in the

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:22,730
yeah in the in the thin station

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:25,190
configuration pile so with that I I like

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,380
to have a allow allow a lot of time for

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,410
questions so I'm going to stop

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:44,720
presenting and start asking you all what

00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:48,800
what questions you have sir it's not

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,900
that easy the ISO has two files in this

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,320
case the iso I had two files with it one

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:57,320
was vm lentes which was a compressed

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,330
version of the Linux kernel okay and

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,340
then the other one was the initial

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:08,270
ramdisk in that rd the anent rd has all

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:10,730
the device drivers that the system

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,070
administrator believes are important the

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,050
one that compiled thin station that he

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,930
thought were important to be able to put

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:20,540
into into the ramdisk to be able to

00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,970
support as many machines as possible so

00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:26,720
there's drivers in there for you know

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:29,500
realtek there's drivers in there for you

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,330
know II 1000 Intel cars there's you know

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:37,250
and it's it's also a way to to make your

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,380
your distribution of linux more secure

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:43,040
because if you knew that your

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,900
organization only has intel a 1000 cards

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,280
then you could leave all those other

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,100
drivers out and says I we're only

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:53,150
supporting intelli one thousands and you

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:57,530
know if if somebody brings in a guy with

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:59,360
a with an unsupported card you could you

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:03,860
could configure the bios to say hey your

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,390
car doesn't is doesn't work here in and

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:10,150
you got to you know get one of our

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:13,150
machines that answer your question okay

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,150
sir

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,640
it's already got I'm pixie loaded on it

00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:34,350
so you had so you have taken this

00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:37,760
version I'm yes yeah yeah you've you've

00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:40,290
configured I'm pics I pics you to say

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,420
this is exactly where the web server is

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,370
this is IP address it doesn't have to be

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:48,360
an IP address it could be you know

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:51,300
something up Leno com Leno com wherever

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,050
your server in the cloud is and yeah

00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,850
you're you as your USB stick says that

00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:06,300
we're definitely using I pixie and that

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:10,910
is where your initial boot files are it

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,910
gives you the HTTP protocol

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,080
that's right yeah exactly

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:36,220
any other questions I have not worked

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:40,390
with the question was have a scene

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,490
support for I pixie in cobbler and I

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,440
haven't messed with that software at all

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,530
so I'll just put it out to the group is

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:51,850
anybody else seeing support forward and

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:58,510
cobbler no is cobbler kind of like

00:29:51,850 --> 00:30:00,850
puppet or a pixie okay college with

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:05,830
pixie provisioning tool all right you

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:07,300
would think I would know that but no I I

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:18,070
haven't messed with that one at all

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:18,930
sorry okay so I want to hold you up if

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,710
you want to get to any other

00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:34,230
presentations or Roger the interface for

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:38,740
the router sure this is an almond router

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:43,180
it has it's the first router with a

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:45,280
graphical display that you can touch and

00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,470
configure the router just by you know

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,620
touching the router itself instead of

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:53,970
having to go to a web administration

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,970
page or something like that

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:10,010
yeah okay good question so I think I can

00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:16,169
um on your web server i'll just send

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,940
answer it quickly and try to get to it

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:23,039
later on your web server you're going to

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:27,030
have a directory for your HTTP route and

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,280
then under there in this this example

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:32,669
I've got a folder called el LPS and

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,240
inside LPS is just two files is vm

00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:38,850
awareness and the initial rammed is

00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,669
which i had built from the sensation

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:46,470
package so instead of having you could

00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,830
just have another folder let's say you

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:52,380
wanted to Red Hat Enterprise Linux you

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:55,860
could just have the vm lettuce and and

00:31:52,380 --> 00:32:01,520
whatever Mitchell Rambis comes with that

00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,520
in a separate folder for you know rhel

00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:24,649
the whole library system is sitting in

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:26,389
those two files yeah so yeah it's pretty

00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:28,159
impressive the you know load a whole

00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:31,639
operating system from from two files

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,769
from a web server and and that's why

00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,379
reason I got interested in in the first

00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:38,830
place linux is small enough and light

00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:41,539
enough as a kernel to be able to just

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,979
you know live out that modular promise

00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:46,099
and say well I don't need all this stuff

00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:49,099
I just need you know a decent array of

00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:51,470
network cards maybe open office and

00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:54,619
webster and a web browser and hey that's

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,659
all I need for my employees right or in

00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:58,129
this case you know well let's give you

00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:00,559
the encryption wizard too and let's

00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:03,289
let's give your employees some security

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,239
by not loading all kinds of disk drivers

00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:09,049
and you know allowing them to get

00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:12,109
viruses that way now can you get a can

00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:16,789
you still get a virus with LPS in this

00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:19,700
setup yes but the virus is limited is

00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:21,229
living in RAM and you would you could

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:27,470
solve it just why turn the computer off

00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:33,279
and reboot but but well if you've been

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:33,279
to some of the other security talks here

00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:37,340
viruses are getting sneaking in and

00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,429
sneakier and they're figuring out ways

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,080
to get in the RAM also so you know maybe

00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:44,359
that's a bigger consideration than it

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,950
used to be but most system

00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,769
administrators in the past would would

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,269
be happy you know as ducks in a pond to

00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:53,919
just be able to turn off a computer and

00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,919
reboot it and everything be fine

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:06,230
okay so any other questions all right

00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,800
well I hope I've communicated the power

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,159
of Linux booting over a network from a

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:16,010
web server web server doesn't have to be

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,220
a monster web server or nothing you can

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:24,919
see the pogoplug right there is 256 meg

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:32,200
machine running on a 40 c on processor

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:32,200
which is a are based on arch linux arm

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:52,220
actually that little box is running ntp

00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:55,520
and it's got postfix on i would say that

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:59,869
you could run it and i have run it from

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,140
a decently slow router or us I mean I

00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:04,820
specialize in 10 year old boxes because

00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,180
I get a lot of them donated to me and i

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:11,150
put linux on them give them to you know

00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:16,130
people that need them generally you know

00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:18,740
poor members of it there you go yeah

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:26,150
broken hard drive I don't care just give

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:27,500
me a cpu and a network card right so you

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,490
know you can just take your broken

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:34,849
laptop screw it to your to your coffee

00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:37,099
table and you know boot for the network

00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:48,140
and not worry about your friends

00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:51,320
screwing anything up yeah so

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:57,530
okay so we're going about 45 minutes and

00:35:51,320 --> 00:36:01,550
I want to get my friend I forgot your

00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:04,670
name time to set up yeah okay so thank

00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:12,290
you for listening and come back to self

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:14,390
next hear your customers rely on your

00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,760
website or application if it's slower

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,670
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,530
and costs you money keeping your

00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,020
business critical systems humming along

00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:27,870
requires insight into what they're doing

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,850
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,100
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:34,260
resource limitations and other problems

00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,180
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,790
your systems performance metrics in

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,640
real-time and record this data for later

00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,620
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,660
see what's really going on under the

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,790
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,770
visualize the status of all your systems

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,500
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:55,620
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,080
memory swap processes load and network

00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,660
usage click a specific system to access

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,670
its individual dashboard then click and

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,670
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:07,650
more detail comprehensive network data

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,350
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,940
is available on the network tab and disk

00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,830
rights and free space on the disk

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,680
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:19,230
displays usage statistics for individual

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,390
processes the system info tab shows

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,640
listening services active connections

00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,770
and available updates adding long view

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,450
to a system is easy just click the

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,610
button copy the one line installation

00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:32,040
command then run the command on your

00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,750
linux system to complete the process the

00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,940
agent will begin collecting data and

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,790
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,340
start rolling

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,710
used longview to gain visibility into

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:46,450
your servers so when your website or app

00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,450
heats up it stays up

00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,520
most enterprises today realize that

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,200
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,570
enough to keep their network saved from

00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,640
unauthorized intrusions that's why

00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,680
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,780
popular lately that adds that extra

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,450
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,220
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,440
know is that some two-factor

00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,630
authentication solutions they're better

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,690
than others like two-factor strong

00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,520
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,770
beyond on their authentication systems

00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,170
by being less expensive easier to

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,600
implement and easier to use giving

00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,670
software-based token clients built to

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,090
run on all major devices and OSS

00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:11,730
including iOS and Android these tokens

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:14,310
utilize a public/private key combination

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,290
that's generated on device so there

00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,840
aren't any shared secrets flying around

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:21,780
or attackers to hijack or which require

00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,850
any special handling instead all keys

00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,310
are kept secure and private between the

00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,500
requesting token and your server which

00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,140
you control aim house making it the most

00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,790
secure way possible to perform

00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,610
authentication encryption and with an

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,400
extensive flexible API and support for

00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:40,350
protocols like el dev and radius wicked

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,950
works with any enterprise network

two-factor authentication for the first

00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:55,810
time or just ready to ditch your

00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:58,300
existing expensive key fob system we can

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:23,540
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:27,060
happening in open source the

00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,860
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,960
of the community and the speed at which

00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,970
these are these you know these these

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,280
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,860
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,590
that really shows the power of the you

00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,210
know of the open source community it is

00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:46,410
global and it's definitely because of

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:52,740
the users community people are extremely

00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:54,630
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,940
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,640
guys helping each other out and they're

00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,350
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,340
the product is transparent for everyone

00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:07,500
everyone can look at the code base

00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,770
everyone can see how close that is being

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:15,270
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:17,880
everything is open in many ways it's

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:22,350
absolutely vital to the the unborn

00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,550
health cloudstack the most exciting

00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:29,400
event in recent memory for me was our

00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:32,040
first developer boot camp

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,680
and our call gave people a gave me two

00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,640
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:42,840
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,660
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,210
chairs in the room twice everything

00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,540
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:54,510
is open source and so I don't think that

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,280
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,310
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,860
computing and so i think it's i think

00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,360
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:07,100
about cloud computing you're really

00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,100
talking about a source cloud computing

00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:13,440
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,810
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,830
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:23,100
data centers these hardware is going to

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:26,310
fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,800
handle number one that mass scale number

00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,530
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,380
that inevitably happens in large

00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:38,580
deployments started working on cod tech

00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,880
over four years ago and it was the

00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,620
original set of people working on it had

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,730
a background of delivering software

00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:51,960
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:55,590
lots of users actually using it high

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,680
availability is the key feature multiple

00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,840
hypervisors support different network

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,870
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,610
better while step management server can

00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:09,330
be deployed in different physical

00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:10,980
machines it definitely has a huge

00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:15,960
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:18,540
there's a major movie studio that they

00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,840
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,820
to transcode video and i thought that

00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,470
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,740
more fascinating is what they did during

00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:31,530
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,880
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,440
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,430
the instances and go back

00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,869
doing real work CloudStack is vast it

00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,400
touches so many different aspects and

00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:43,619
there's no one person that's kind of

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,069
like a master of all those realms I

00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:49,770
think cloudstack as a project is going

00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:53,569
to be one of the leaders simply because

00:43:49,770 --> 00:44:00,210
it's some of the most feature Folan and

00:43:53,569 --> 00:44:03,470
and robust platforms out they were Adam

00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,470
senior living through the clouds dag

00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,350
you

00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,740
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:28,690
ago we could not have imagined that

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,880
asterisk would not only become the most

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,040
widely adopted open source communication

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,080
software on the planet but that it would

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,600
impact the entire industry in the way

00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,580
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,190
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,170
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:46,240
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,650
transition of power from the hands of

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,930
the traditional proprietary phone

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:52,330
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,250
administrators of phone systems using

00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,480
this power our customers have created

00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,430
all sorts of business changing

00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,290
applications from small office phone

00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,780
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,400
the international carrier networks in

00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,200
fact there's even an entire country

00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,570
those communications infrastructure runs

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,700
on esters the gym has always been about

00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,410
creating technology that expands

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,600
communications capabilities in ways that

00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:14,800
we could never have imagined and that's

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,170
part of what's game-changing about

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,869
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,970
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:24,100
IP phones that extends control of the

00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,840
user all the way to the desktop the

00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,550
launch of these new products represents

00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,530
the next phase indigenous history of

00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,050
innovation these are the first and only

00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:33,760
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,320
power of esters when we first discussed

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,359
our expectations for building a family

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,490
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,230
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,880
the team to build the phones such that

00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,070
they were easy to install integrate

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,930
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,480
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:51,130
that goal user feedback is validating

00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,230
that when it comes to operation with

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,660
asher space systems including our own

00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,240
Switchvox based product these are the

00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:59,530
easiest to use best integrated most

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,140
interoperable products on the market

00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:04,119
today the Digium family of phones will

00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,160
initially include three IP desk phones

00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,109
uniquely designed to complement any

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,000
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:12,640
these phones are different for a number

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,310
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,720
designed for use with asterisks secondly

00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,359
we've made it really easy to

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,740
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,420
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,839
to access information inside of

00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,390
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:29,279
application and the phone additionally

00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,559
we've created an applications engine

00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:33,749
that allows users and developers to

00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,509
create and run their own apps on the

00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:38,579
phone and finally we've done all of this

00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:40,319
at a very compelling price point at

00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:42,509
Digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,880
give our customers the best value in

00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:46,170
business phone systems and also give

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,269
them the power to create their own

00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,069
solutions or eating communications

00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:51,749
challenge well continue to push the

00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:53,519
boundaries not only to make Astra's

00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:55,380
cooler faster and more technologically

00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,969
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,160
what communications even easier and

00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:02,059
together we'll change the way the world

00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,059
