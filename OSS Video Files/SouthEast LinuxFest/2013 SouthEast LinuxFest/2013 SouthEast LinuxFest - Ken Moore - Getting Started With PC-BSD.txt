the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,340
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,860
charlotte north carolina it is licensed

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,509
under a creative commons license for

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,619
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,830
linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,600
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,150
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,710
possible okay thank you very much for

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,349
coming to my talk my name is ken morph

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,700
part of the PG pc-bsd project and i'm

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,530
just going to present to you getting

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,079
started with PCB a basic introduction

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,640
for how to install and run it and what

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,390
some of the unique applications are

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,420
within the pc-bsd desktop environment

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,780
alright so first off pc-bsd is based

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,850
upon an operating system entitled

00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,230
freebsd so at linux conferences like

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,079
this we always get the question well

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,360
what is freebsd so here's just a couple

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,789
you know key points the good it's a

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,730
unix-like operating system descended

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,920
from a tnt unix legal for legal reasons

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,390
it can't be called unix specifically

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,320
instead they have adopted the moniker

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,479
bsd or berkeley software distribution

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,270
all right it has legendary stability and

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,700
security people will run vs DS from you

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,409
know six or seven years ago they'll

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,090
never upgrade off with like the version

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,770
4 even though we're already past version

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,299
9 it still runs and still works great

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,170
for running web servers and stuff it's a

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,210
very secure very stable operating system

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,479
it has what is called the port system

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,939
this is a collection of over over 23,000

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,890
at the current moment instructions for

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,840
building applications from source and

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,100
these can be any applications most of

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,600
them are the same open source

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,820
applications that you know and love in

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,189
the Linux community pretty much any open

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,290
source application with GPL license BSD

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,659
license you know whatever you've got so

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,180
you have your mozilla firefox is you

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,159
have your Apaches you have your ngin x

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,509
servers you've got you know pretty much

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,969
everything that you expects you to have

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,860
a unified development model its

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,229
development structure is a bit different

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,119
from Linux in that it's designed and run

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,340
more like a business you have a central

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,080
team a central core team that's elected

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,000
every few years and they're the ones

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
that make the decisions about okay this

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,280
is the direction that we're going

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,170
to go which is what we're going to

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,180
pursue will hire developers to do this

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,710
and this on it but then they also accept

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,420
all the donations from other developers

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,860
who say hey I want it to do this I'm

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,000
going to write it and say here it is and

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,010
they'll say okay then we'll go ahead and

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,330
put it in and implement it so just for

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,950
that reason that's one of the reasons

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,380
it's so stable and secures they try to

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,000
make sure from that format that

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,950
everything that's done and added to the

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,570
operating system keeps backwards

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,220
compatibility with everything else that

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,830
is previously run they try to make sure

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,720
not to constantly break formats as they

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,920
proceed it has excellent documentation

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,890
FreeBSD is known for having their

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,390
handbook if you go online its massive

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,370
handbook for covering pretty much

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,200
everything related to freebsd so if you

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,820
have a question and you go on the

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,410
mailing list to the foreign people say

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,600
oh well did you read the handbook page

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,010
on whatever it is that you're having an

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,100
issue with is excellent documentation

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,260
sources for freebsd and then lastly it

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,310
actually has the bsd license for those

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,840
of you that don't know what the BSD

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,760
licenses I'll show it to you here in

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,060
just a moment but let me talk about the

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,500
bad for a moment one it is command line

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,500
only this is good for server

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,510
applications but for graphical

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,310
applications where you actually want to

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,930
have a desktop environment it makes it

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,370
kind of difficult because it's not

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,680
designed for that it's more of design

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,450
just for command line servers and then

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,890
it's also because it was designed more

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,590
for command line servers it's lacking

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,480
some of the more PC oriented device

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,030
drivers and stuff like graphics drivers

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,230
ati drivers particularly while they're

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,910
getting a lot better on this they're

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,890
still missing some support for a lot of

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,350
the ati drivers they just recently added

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,670
the Intel graphics driver sets and those

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,200
work pretty well there still might be a

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,930
few mugs because they're pretty new but

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,880
the nvidia graphics drivers are

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,550
excellent we actually have great binary

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,250
blobs from the nvidia people themselves

00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,320
specifically created for freebsd so we

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,160
always recommend nvidia graphics drivers

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,450
if you're going to get started with

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,000
freebsd just because they have the

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,030
absolutely the best support a TI it's

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,130
getting there okay now let's go ahead

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,330
and talk about the bsd license a little

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,330
bit so here is the bsd license this is

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,150
the official bsd license the three claws

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,590
bsd license and basically as you can

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,290
read it's just three little clauses

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,670
first one says you have to include our

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,230
be right and anything that you use that

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,640
uses the software if you're going to

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,220
develop off of it just you know make

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,080
sure to keep our copyright in their

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,840
second one or sorry second one is

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,450
reproduced to cut right no both

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,400
basically reproduce copyright in there

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,710
don't sue us if it breaks and then the

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,920
third clause is usually you can't use

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,630
the name of the application without the

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,170
users consent without the author's

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,910
consent in more recent days if this has

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,760
actually been shrunk down to just two

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,770
clauses they've removed the

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,750
redistribution of involving the name and

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,310
of the organization and stuff they've

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,600
kind of removed that clause and said we

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,880
don't need that we'll just restrict it

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,440
to two claws so include our copyright

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,150
and don't solicit for breaks that's

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,510
pretty much it nice and easy for the BSD

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,220
license for the GPL license that's the

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,950
standard Linux license that a lot of you

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,370
are familiar with this is for comparison

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:25,530
the GPL license in the same font GPL

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:30,960
version 3 and it goes over many many

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,640
many many pages and I can't even tell

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,860
you everything that's in it because I'm

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,450
not a trained lawyer all I know is that

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,000
it kind of has stuff that says you can't

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,260
do this you should do this and then I

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,790
believe there are some things in it that

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,080
says you must do this if you're

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,480
developing off of it from a user

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,220
perspective I don't think it does that

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,150
but again I'm not a lawyer don't take my

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,320
word for it you're probably going to

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,700
want to go hire somebody to read through

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,520
it and make sure you're compliant with

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,710
with it bsd license is much simpler so

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,930
the freebsd always prized to push the

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,580
bsd license whenever possible and pcbs

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:04,170
he takes this approach as well licensed

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,540
under the bsd license all right so what

00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,510
is pc-bsd then we've covered a little

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,550
bit of what freebsd is pc-bsd takes

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,860
freebsd and tries to make it simple

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,110
tries to take all the hardship and pain

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,180
out of configuration out of the way and

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,450
make it simple to use specifically for

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,280
desktop environments and workstations so

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,560
as i have here it is a pre-configured

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,820
desktop or server installation i'm not

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,860
going to go into the server side aspect

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,440
of that we call we refer to that as true

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,930
OS that is the pc-bsd server and

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,820
and the desktop environment it is also

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,660
desktop environment agnostic we do not

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:43,450
care if you run KDE or known or LXDE or

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,550
xfce or a host of the other unsupported

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,320
what we classify has unsupported or

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,210
advanced window managers that are

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,690
available you know take your pick it

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,670
doesn't really matter to us the pc-bsd

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,160
editions will run desktop independent

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,690
should run on all of them all right so

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,900
what are some of these additions that

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,360
the pc-bsd project brings to the table 1

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,130
they have a graphical installer this is

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,290
quite different from the FreeBSD

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,510
installer which again is text-based and

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,490
gives you very very basic install

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,830
instructions but if you want to install

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,540
things such as the ZFS file system which

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,150
is one of freebsd s great strengths

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,250
using the freebsd installer you would

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,530
have to just go to the command line look

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,850
up a handbook and spend an hour more

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,980
trying to figure out what the proper

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,920
commands are to manually create your ZFS

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,300
pools with pc-bsd there's a graphical

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,890
installer makes it very simple to get

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,380
through it and it will automatically set

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,790
up ZFS filesystem for you as well as all

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,440
the other options and we'll go through

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,180
the installer more details here in a

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,220
little bit but this is one of the

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,870
enhancements that pc-bsd brings to the

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,630
table is simplifying the installation

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,030
process to very very simple alright

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,890
second one is warden freebsd has a

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,930
system called jails that basically lets

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,480
you run very very low footprint

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,890
virtualized environments on FreeBSD

00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,510
systems we're talking easily running

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,780
thousands of these at a time rather than

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:04,030
tens for other virtual environments so

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,620
the warden is a utility that was created

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,120
specifically for managing and setting

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,860
this up again so you don't have to go

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,150
look through tons of documentation and

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,800
handbooks trying to figure out what the

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,320
proper commands are to set up a single

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,120
jail it'll let you set up and do tons of

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,030
them very easily and manage all of them

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,160
install packages into them etc all right

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,890
pbi package format I'll go into this

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,110
later pc-bsd is also added an additional

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,570
package format in addition to the ones

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,330
offered by freebsd this is more of a

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,099
standard executable a single file that

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,270
you can just download and install and

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,589
run and it keeps it separate from

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,469
everything and as i said i'll go into

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,240
more detail about that later easy ppi a

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,030
graphical application for producing your

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,209
own pbi packages in case our repository

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,439
doesn't happen to have the one that

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,499
one particular application you're

00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:51,420
looking you're looking for excuse me

00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:53,009
system meta packages a nice safe way of

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,600
changing around your system

00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,600
configuration so for instance a meta

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,920
package for the KDE desktop a system

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,029
package for the gnome desktop you don't

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,829
have to worry about getting all the

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,389
individual pieces yourself you can just

00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,129
say oh I want that one and it'll grab

00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,660
the whole thing for you and install us

00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:09,149
that you have compatible versions of

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,610
everything and then there's many other

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,410
graphical system administration things

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,939
for things like such as networking and

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,959
wireless connections and stuff like that

00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:20,399
that's specific to freebsd all right now

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,490
let's go through the installer for

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,379
pc-bsd so this is the first screen that

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,540
you would appear when you load up the

00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,949
disc in the Installer if you hit the

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,600
button in the bottom left corner it

00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:32,100
brings up a nice hardware compatibility

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,779
wizard it will actually check your

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,480
hardware and tell you what will and what

00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,129
won't work this is on my desktop system

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
where I took a screenshot you'll tell I

00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:41,220
don't have a Wi-Fi card in my system so

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,439
that's not going to bother me that says

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,819
there's no Wi-Fi not a problem but as

00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,800
you can see that all the rest of those

00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,449
work I have video drivers I have a

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,999
proper video resolution which is the

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,589
right one for my monitor so 1600 x 900 i

00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,910
have an ethernet device and i have a

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,920
sound device so i'm going to be

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,660
perfectly fine before I even do the

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,269
installation of pc-bsd I know ahead of

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,920
time it'll all work fine if there are

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,019
any issues here it might mean that's

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,850
just some additional configuration will

00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,709
be needed after the edit after the

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,490
installation of pc-bsd in order to get

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:13,319
that device working properly alright

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,689
here's the next screen on the pc-bsd in

00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:18,869
skul installer this is where you select

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:20,069
what you actually want to install so on

00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,049
the top screen these are just kind of

00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,670
the options on the top screen you can

00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,499
see the different desktop environments

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,319
we have available lxde know them and

00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:30,809
xfce then on this one I tried to show

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:33,299
them all you got KDE true OS which is

00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,670
the server option and then plain freebsd

00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,929
on the left as well so these are just

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,059
where you can pick those are the easy

00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:41,999
selections just say oh I want that one

00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,199
and then click Next or if you want more

00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,749
control you can actually click the

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,999
customize button and say I want xfce and

00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:50,879
gnome or you can you know start adding

00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:53,269
and making your own system and adding

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,510
putting all of them in there if you want

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:59,340
the next screen

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:02,650
the disk selection this is by default

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,810
pc-bsd wants to use the entire disk that

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,700
you give to it so I highly recommend

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,320
hitting the customize button if you are

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,730
going to install it to a single

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,760
partition of wise you'll blow away your

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,250
entire computer all right so this is a

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,170
warning always check this is right there

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,480
the entire partition it says also that's

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,980
using the entire disk okay that's just

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,900
the default for this will always hit the

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,070
customize button so let's go into the

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,370
customize button and see what's there

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:29,140
really quick first one there are three

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,240
different modes basic advanced and then

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,530
what's called freebsd experts basically

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,060
it drops you to a command line and says

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,140
okay if you're an expert you should

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,530
already know the commands you want to

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,850
run have at it okay but for most of us

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,640
we just want something that can be

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,510
managed easily by the wood by the UI so

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,850
we're just going to go to through

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,530
advanced mode right now as soon as you

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,390
hit next after advanced mode you can say

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,580
ok there's the specific hard drive and

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,660
it'll show you any partitions on that

00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,220
hard drive as well and you can select

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,880
the particular partition that you would

00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,220
like pc-bsd does require a primary

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,650
partition it does not work on logical

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,660
partitions so I know many Linux distros

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,660
do use logical partitions but no pc-bsd

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,830
requires a primary partition so when you

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,360
need to set up your partitioning

00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,430
beforehand before you load into the

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,250
Installer because it does not do any of

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,630
the partitioning for you okay and then

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,950
if you need to you can partition the

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,840
disk with GPT there as well next select

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,700
your file system ufs has been the

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,040
standard UNIX file system that's been

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,960
around for a good long time however if

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,090
you're running a system that's 64-bit

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,160
with more than two gigabytes of RAM we

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:36,220
highly recommend and we default to

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,990
running the ZFS filesystem this gives

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,960
you all sorts of strengths and abilities

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,150
for such as snapshotting and backups of

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,590
your data and allowing you to roll back

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,900
and do tons of really really cool

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,570
features so we highly recommend

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,280
installing ZFS if your system is capable

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,080
of it again if you got more than two

00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,240
gigabytes of ram and specifically for

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,520
your 64-bit system it's starts to have a

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,310
few issues on 32-bit systems and then

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,560
install bootable MBR that is checked by

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,510
default if you are dual booting this

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,950
with something else like linux or

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,870
windows or you know whatever other

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,660
operating system you want you probably

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,210
want to uncheck that because the freebsd

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,760
bootloader isn't as smart as a lot of

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,650
the ones like grub and easybcd and

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,090
things like that for windows so i would

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,040
recommend not installing the bootloader

00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,840
and then at simply editing grub or

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,080
whatever and adding an entry for pc-bsd

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,640
if you're going to dual boot so i highly

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,930
recommend that stuff so that's that's an

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,910
important one as well you don't want to

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:35,140
blow away your MBR if you don't need to

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,600
and then the last screen is if you have

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,370
ZFS which i selected here you can set up

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,880
for instance mirror and do software raid

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,350
if you have additional hard drives in

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,390
your system you can set up you know

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,070
however many and how you want to mirror

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,600
them do I want to mirror it so I have

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,270
two of them so one of them can fail

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,010
before I you know so i can put one in so

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,480
i have one can fail safely or don't want

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,250
to set it up with three drives so too

00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,170
can fail safely before have issues

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,430
things like that so this lets you set up

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:05,280
a lot of that stuff and then there are

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,660
 out there are a couple more things

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,360
do you want to encrypt your hard drive

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,240
this it uses freebsd s jelly encryption

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,460
layer it goes on the entire drive or the

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,280
entire partition if you have it on a

00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,080
single partition so that before it will

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,570
even mount the partition or hard drive

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,010
it just on the prompt it says oh you

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,020
need to provide your encryption password

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,820
and then it will unlock the drive and

00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,560
then it will proceed to load the file

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,040
system and load everything else on top

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,700
of that so it's on the block is block

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,410
level encryption you can or cannot do

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,900
that as you can see there if you go to

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,880
the next screen again for ZFS it lets

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,680
you actually set some of this special

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,690
options for ZFS as well for instance do

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,970
I want to encrypt particular data sets

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,980
or particular categories the freebsd

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,530
ports tree again is over 23,000

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,420
applications so you're not going to be

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,330
using it all the time so if you have it

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,590
on your system it's kind of nice to

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,780
compress it down so it takes up a lot

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,310
less disk space just because it's not

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,750
there but whenever you need it and go

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,520
into it and just go into the directory

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,160
it'll automatically uncompress it for

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,840
you for access alright so ZFS handles a

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,700
lot of that very very nicely ok that's

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,320
the end of the initial setup once you

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,769
hit next it'll drop you back down to the

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,929
main screen

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,519
it says I'm done hit finished fit

00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:23,019
continue to do it and then you get a

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
nice loading bar I didn't make

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,769
screenshots of that you don't think this

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,420
kalisi more loading bars okay so after

00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,009
that it'll do the installation say all

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,660
right go ahead and hit finish to restart

00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,429
your computer and remove your drive

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,319
after you restart your computer so once

00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,879
that is done it goes to phase two of the

00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,379
installation all right after you've

00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,809
restarted your computer and performed

00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,549
all the installation this goes into what

00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,709
we call the post installation but

00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:47,259
initial setup phase this will only come

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,209
up once and only the first time that you

00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:52,420
go boot into the system after an

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,249
installation okay again just like before

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,939
what language you want that way

00:15:54,249 --> 00:16:00,910
everything is set up for you now time

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:02,319
zone this lets you and if you install

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,910
the system give it to somebody who might

00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:05,499
go across the country and then when they

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,350
get there they boot it up and they can

00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:10,149
set their local timezone okay root

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,529
password so basically your administrator

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:16,029
password password you're all familiar

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:20,079
with that create a user an initial user

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:22,959
now freebie pc-bsd by default the login

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,939
managers do not let you login as root so

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,529
you have to have an initial user and it

00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,360
has to be in the wheel group so that it

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,759
can't use root permissions and switch

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,439
over to root is necessary okay and

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,299
that's all there is for the initial

00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:38,110
configuration and as soon as you hit

00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:40,540
next it loads you into your desktop so

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,519
welcome to pc-bsd this is the LXDE

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,399
desktop this is what we default to on

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,610
lower-end system so under two gigabytes

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,559
of ram so this is alex de in there

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,569
notice they're just just a couple icons

00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,189
on the desktop one for the app cafe

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:55,749
which I'll talk about in just a moment

00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:58,360
but that's where if you want to go get

00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,189
more software for your system without

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,569
interfering with anything else in your

00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:03,750
system that's where you go get it that's

00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:06,579
where you install web browsers because

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,139
some desktop environments don't come

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,169
with a default web browser so you might

00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:12,909
need to go get one first that pc-bsd

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,250
control panel that's where you want to

00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:17,889
go to actually manage anything on your

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,860
system and then pcbs see just like

00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:22,720
freebsd has a handbook with a copy of it

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,279
on your system right there so if you

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,319
ever have any questions about how to do

00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,360
something in pc-bsd we have a

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,620
comprehensive hand

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,179
book with a link right there on the

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,559
desktop so you can just open that up and

00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:41,880
look it up if we have tons of

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:44,820
information in there yes that is the

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,250
symbol that lxde decided to give to pdfs

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:52,140
apparently so adobe reader is not

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:54,720
installed by default I believe lxde has

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,860
a program called ii.pdf view I believe

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,740
is what it's called and that's what it

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,870
will use for pdfs again it's pc-bsd

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,730
desktop system agnostic so whatever the

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,080
desktop environment installs for the

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,970
different formats is what you're going

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,290
to get with initially unless you go into

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,230
the app cafe and install something else

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,390
okay so let's go ahead and continue and

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,530
we'll go through some of those things I

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,870
just mentioned here's a view of the

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,700
pc-bsd control panel those of you that

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:21,120
are familiar with KDE will say hey this

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,270
looks very familiar yeah it does pc-bsd

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,220
uses the QT toolkit for all of its

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,600
graphical interfaces and so does que te

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,980
so a lot of the widgets will end up

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,720
looking rather similar even though we

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,299
don't and specifically intend for that

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,559
but this is the control panel as you can

00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,720
see there's blinks again for the app

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,429
cafe easy pbi which I mentioned earlier

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,860
and we'll discuss some more as well as

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:43,890
things for like setting up Active

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,570
Directory or setting up nvidia cuz i

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,570
have an nvidia card in the system so i

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,370
get into the nvidia settings setting up

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,320
your firewall there's the warden at the

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,910
bottom and life preserver which i'll

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,340
actually talk about here in just a

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,020
moment but first let's go into the

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,030
system configuration the system manager

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,530
on the control panel this is where

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,970
during the installation you know how I

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,200
mentioned that you could install if you

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,940
get the customize button you could

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,350
install any of the desktops or all the

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,390
desktops that you wanted or configure

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,799
your system any way you want going into

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,169
the system manager presents you this

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,370
exact same options this is the exact

00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,140
same tree that you would see in the

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,940
installer and as you can see you can

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,470
select or unselect any of the desktops

00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,990
up above there's tons of unsupported

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,220
desktops what we call unsupported but

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,360
they're really more advanced desktops

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,460
where you might need to know some

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,750
terminal not not great for new computer

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,120
users that aren't familiar with the

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,540
command line not recommended okay as

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,830
well as some stuff like XBMC and some

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,419
additional drivers if you might need

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,419
them for specific devices

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,180
some of the other utilities that we have

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,140
here again I mentioned these earlier but

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,420
I'll just run through them really quick

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,070
app cafe if you want to manage end user

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,840
applications you go into the app cafe

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,880
and that will use the pbi system which

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,560
we'll discuss in just a moment and to

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,060
install applications this keeps it

00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,920
system independent so that you don't

00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,120
have to worry about touching anything or

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,010
messing up your system just because you

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,750
want to upgrade your fire your web

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,550
browser and I'll go into that life

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,000
preserver this is a utility that pc-bsd

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,760
includes to remotely back up all of your

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,410
user data to some off-site server the

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,170
only requirements for that server is

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,240
that it runs SSH and our sink so this

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,550
could be a freenas box this could be a

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,590
linux box you know any kind of server as

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,290
long as it runs SSH and our sink you can

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:28,090
set up life preserver to say oh I want

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,800
to store all of my data over there and

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,270
you can even tell it how frequently you

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,590
want to backup all your data you can do

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,170
it every day you can do it every week

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,270
however you want and if you go to a new

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,950
system and you have your data all backed

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,560
up you can open life preserver and say

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,780
ok I'm here now on a completely new

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,010
system I want to go to my server and I

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,600
want to pull all my data from that

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,210
server and put it on this system too and

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,160
you can have it do that as well so

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,630
that's a utility that pc-bsd provides

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,950
specifically for backups demit just to

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,330
make it easy but you don't have to set

00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,140
us up if you don't want to it'll just

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:01,450
sit there ok mount tray so freebsd is

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,400
not linux we can't use a lot of the

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,410
device mounting applications that are

00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,530
available in linux because of that we

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,450
wrote our own application which we quite

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,210
unimaginative lee called the mount tray

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,590
for mounting external devices and it

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,090
just sits in the tray and whenever you

00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,530
plug in a USB stick or whatever it will

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,090
pop up a little notification saying hey

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,010
I detected that something was plugged in

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,450
you click on that you can click mountain

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,820
will automatically mounted for you and

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,270
open it up in your file manager so that

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,620
you can add do whatever you want with it

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,210
system configuration the network manager

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,010
as I mentioned if you want to change

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,800
your network configurations wireless

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,030
wired or wireless you would go into

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,310
there and you could find all the common

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,660
settings for that as well and then

00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,940
there's also a sound configuration

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,550
device pc-bsd will try to automatically

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,990
set up your sound device to one of them

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,690
as it said on the thing it's mindless

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,340
PCM for I believe it was that isn't

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,220
always right so I always recommend going

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,750
into that

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,799
right after an installation just to make

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,150
sure it is there's a little button in

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,350
there to test your sound as well so you

00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,990
can just click on each device and hit

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,580
test sound until you find the right one

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:06,020
ok let's go on all right now I've been

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,580
leading up to this for a while the pbi

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,690
package system this is kind of what I

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,770
deal with quite a bit so I want to go

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,440
into this just a little bit longer

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,030
basically the purpose of the pbi package

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,730
system is to provide a safe system

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:23,659
package independent method of installing

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:25,429
and updating applications it also makes

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:26,960
sure the applications do not require an

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,760
internet connection for a plethora

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,159
installation we have a lot of people use

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,960
pc-bsd go to them go to the library for

00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,610
internet and so they just bring a USB

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,559
stick but they want to get applications

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,510
as well so this left them simply

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,000
download the application on some public

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,799
computer somewhere move that pbi file

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,360
onto their USB stick and then take it

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,340
home and once they're at home then they

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,630
can extract and install that application

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,720
on their local computer without ever

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:53,270
requiring an internet connection what's

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,980
on their main box and then it also

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,500
minimizes library duplication to

00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:03,890
preserve disk space pbis will share

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:05,360
libraries among all of the pbis so yeah

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,770
let's go and continue that would those

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,700
were the goals and the purpose let's go

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,240
into some of the implication

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,909
implementation if for pc-bsd 9 and later

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,480
it was written in pure shell not bash

00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:19,730
its you know bin slash ice age this

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,289
allows for simple compatibility and it

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,549
lets it work on our server additions as

00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,470
well because it doesn't require any

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:26,240
graphical tool kits or anything else

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,990
that it just all it requires is the base

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,520
SH that's included in freebsd it

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,980
intelligently shares libraries between

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,530
PBIS as I said it'll basically install

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,110
copies of all of the files into what's

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,700
called a hash der it doesn't see any

00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,950
other ones and then it manages and make

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,990
sure it is only one version of each of

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,190
those libraries on disk so any

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,360
application that requires that

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,210
particular version of that particular

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,140
library will all share that library

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,929
because there's only one copy on disk a

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,630
single TV I contains all the libraries

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:02,480
files and data needed for an application

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,550
to run this means that a single pbi file

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,180
will be larger than you

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:11,060
spect on Linux for instance the Firefox

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,530
pbi is about a hundred megabytes the

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,820
surprise is a lot of the people who come

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,260
from Linux because the same wait a

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,120
minute it should only be about 20

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,520
megabytes well the reason for that is

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,380
includes all the dependencies all the

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,030
graphical tool kits all the files all

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,210
everything else that it needs is

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:30,500
contained in that pbi so it's a much

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:33,320
larger instil initially but once you

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,300
have a PB I installed as soon as a new

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,630
version is available there is also Delta

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,600
upgrades for that so the update pbi or

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,970
dot PBP it might be like two megabytes

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,890
to upgrate to the next one so the Delta

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,660
there are Delta upgrades once you have a

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,070
PB I initially installed so you only

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,550
have to do that massive download once

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,290
and then as I mentioned earlier it is

00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,000
completely independent of the local

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,070
system packages and other pbi

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,900
applications PB is are a separate

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,940
package they go into a separate area on

00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,860
the hard drive they do not mix with

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,330
system packages or any other type of

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,460
package that you have on the system and

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,650
they do not mix with the operating

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,840
system itself as well they're kept

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,050
completely separately so you can add add

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,250
them remove them upgrade them all

00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,810
completely safely without touching

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,610
anything else on your system so you

00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,020
don't need to lose a weekend trying to

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,340
fix your computer just because you

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:27,770
wanted to update your web browser easy

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,290
pbi this is a graphical utility generate

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,590
to use for generating your own ppi

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,210
packages if for instance one you're some

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,550
particular application that you really

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,420
need is not available in our repo our

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,860
repo has over 11,000 1100 ppi so most

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,060
stuff is in there but you know just in

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,550
case there's that one thing you need

00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,430
it's just a simple UI to go through and

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,870
generate it and PBIS require a set of

00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,330
build instructions before the actual

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,830
build easy pbi lets you automatically

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,300
generate those build instructions and

00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,700
you can have that done in less than five

00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,590
minutes the actual build time will vary

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,330
depending on the speed of your computer

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,710
and how much RAM you have and stuff like

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,660
that but that will go through and build

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:10,280
the pbi in a clean environment on your

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,660
system alright the warden I mentioned

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,160
this earlier but again we have a

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,480
graphical interface for this as well

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,330
there's both coming online versions

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,269
implemented again and pure

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:22,090
and a graphical version specifically for

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:24,309
pc-bsd that lets you set up many of the

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,320
different types of jails pc-bsd also

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,940
lets you set up three types of jails in

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,919
particular one is the traditional

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,679
FreeBSD jail that lets you install a

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,840
freebsd command-line server into the

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,850
jail that's what we call it traditional

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,279
FreeBSD jails the second one is a ports

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,620
jail this is a nice clean sandbox

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,450
environment that's not quite as secure

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,710
as a traditional jail because it's meant

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,179
for you to be able to run applications

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,500
in it from your host application use the

00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,760
graphical system so it's a great

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,639
environment for if you're developing

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,289
applications and you want to have a

00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:57,639
testing environment basically a

00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,740
development environment where you can do

00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:01,240
whatever you want in there it won't mess

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,539
up your host system but you can still

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,639
run it from your host system and then

00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,070
finally we have linux jails as well you

00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:10,630
can install particular Linux this into

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,630
the jail right now we have scripts to

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,539
install I believe it's gen 2 and debian

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,029
it's the second one so those are COI

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:20,769
versions of Linux only no graphics

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:22,750
whatsoever we're still working on a

00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,580
Linux port jail there been a lot of

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,289
people asking for that and we'll see

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,110
what we can do with that not nothing

00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:30,730
nothing guaranteed there there's also

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,159
the ability to export and import jails

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,590
between systems so once you get up get a

00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,480
jail all set up that you want you could

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,330
export it and then import it on some

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,950
headless box somewhere else if you want

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,929
to once it's all set ups this makes it

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,850
very nice for manually setting up and

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:51,279
interfacing with servers that you might

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:55,090
manage elsewhere as well and then coming

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,370
soon we have package ng system this is

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,210
the next generation package management

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:04,059
system for freebsd it is has been

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,190
developed and is continually being

00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:08,200
developed and pc-bsd has jumped on the

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,639
bandwagon a bit early is providing a

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,200
whole lot of the testing and additional

00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:16,960
development testing of package ng we're

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,600
constant contact at the developer of the

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,850
package ng system so this will allow you

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,409
to instead of building from ports which

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,240
is building from source all the time to

00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:28,370
actually let you download and install

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,080
binary packages similar bit similar to

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,370
if you're familiar with that and Linux

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,160
and some of the other package managers

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,490
in linux freebsd is just finally getting

00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,910
there with binary packages for all that

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:43,490
stuff however with that pc-bsd has also

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:46,010
added a full graphical package manager

00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,720
as well so in addition to the meta

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,040
packages that I referred to earlier that

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,720
we had early just for desktop

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,890
environments and stuff like that if you

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,960
go into the advanced mode you can

00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,000
actually do each individual package

00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,710
piece by piece if you would like to so

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,470
it gives you that full capability using

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,330
the package system and then we still do

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,640
have in the basic mode those meta

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,800
packages available for again safe system

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,059
configuration if you're for instance my

00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,170
wife who just wants to switch to a

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:10,820
different desktop because she doesn't

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,620
like how que te keeps breaking on you

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,950
know that kind of thing if that happens

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,340
happens to happen so you still have that

00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,890
safe mode as well as the Advanced Mode

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,530
plus pc-bsd is just moving to a rolling

00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,870
release distribution framework this

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,910
means that our packages that we provide

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,340
are going to be updated pretty much

00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,990
every two weeks I believe is the plan so

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,120
you can get update notifications

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,350
whenever you have new packages available

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,090
for what's installed on your system

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,010
every two weeks and you can keep up with

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,290
that as well as keeping up with new

00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,730
versions of any of the pc-bsd utilities

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:47,780
and tools you'll be prompted when those

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,550
are available as well plus once that is

00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,970
all set up we're also planning on

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,380
creating a tracking freebsd stable there

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,360
if you don't know there's a few

00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,090
different tracks of freebsd this freebsd

00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:03,230
release which is 9.1 currently which is

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:05,840
why pc-bsd is 9.1 freebsd stable starts

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,360
working on not quite 9.1 but not quite

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,730
you know the next 19.2 but helps you to

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,800
get in there and get some of the

00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:14,630
additional freebsd improvements before

00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,700
they've officially been released in

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,200
freebsd this is useful for if you need

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,030
some additional drivers or things like

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,850
that that the older versions of freebsd

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:28,460
just don't work quite right for all

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:33,320
right well that's again the general

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,690
overview of pc-bsd it's very very very

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,010
low level so do you have any questions

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,309
about it this is where the strength of

00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,539
it comes in just showing you the basics

00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:53,200
do you have any questions about pc-bsd

00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:55,749
yes sir yes freebsd by default includes

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,120
a compiler in the actual operating

00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:59,980
system itself so not even if you don't

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,710
have any packages on on the system at

00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,830
all the free the operating system itself

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:08,769
has a default compiler in it it has been

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:11,919
GCC but with the newer versions it is

00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:22,210
switching over to claim which is llvm I

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:23,830
believe yes yes as he mentioned GCC and

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,210
many other compilers are available

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,799
imports are just not included in the

00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,679
base operating system effort Lodi

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,590
believes a version right now with 9.1

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,970
both GCC and clang are actually built

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,039
into the main OS but they're going to be

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:42,909
dropping support for GCC in the main OS

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:44,769
with future versions yes the question

00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:46,450
was about Haskell support FreeBSD and

00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:47,769
yes there is ports available for that as

00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,840
well so you can get the Haskell compiler

00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:54,659
you just need to install the package or

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:57,549
go to ports and compile yourself yes

00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,330
java development environment we do have

00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:04,179
some Java support in freebsd

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:06,519
specifically in the form of OpenJDK all

00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:09,730
right we have OpenJDK version 6 and

00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:12,549
version 7 and this pulls from and uses

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:17,230
java versions six and seven respectively

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:19,029
but the official java application we do

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,490
not have the latest versions we have an

00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:32,169
older outdated version of that of the

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:35,440
diablo jdk yeah any other questions ok

00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:38,799
questions about wine yes we do have port

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,570
for wine it is a 32-bit only port though

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,159
which again I believe is because the

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,460
application itself is only designed to

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,100
be 32 bit for pc-bsd we actually have PB

00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,980
is available for wine and a special one

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,460
called wine 64 so if you're running a

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,020
64-bit system and

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,710
still want to use wine even though it's

00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,420
32 bit if you install the wine 64 pbi it

00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,670
will install both wine as well as a

00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,350
bunch of the 32-bit compatibility stuff

00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:12,620
to make sure that it runs perfect on a

00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:14,540
64-bit system as well yes yeah the

00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,720
question wasn't in general is freebsd

00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,820
more general more stable than Linux and

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,820
I I have heard it said so yes

00:33:46,480 --> 00:34:10,700
yes yes yes yes many FreeBSD users hate

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,010
having to reboot their computer so one

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,690
of the stability aspects of freebsd is

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,010
just seeing how long you can run it

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,770
before you actually have to reboot the

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,389
box and i have heard cases of years

00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,940
going by before somebody had to reboot

00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,740
their box so again that's a your mileage

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,020
may vary situation but those are the

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:45,520
kind of things we hear here and as to

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:45,520
how stable is any other questions yes

00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,610
the question was what do you have in the

00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,429
way of virtualization stuff we do not

00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,640
have kvm at the moment we do have

00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:01,850
VirtualBox both imports and in PB is an

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:06,290
MP bi form and I believe do we have any

00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:21,530
other major virtual issue we can run in

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:24,950
zent Oh in Zen okay yes so the bsd

00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,890
version hypervisor beehive is coming but

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:32,960
it's not there yet all right so stay

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:36,920
tuned for that and we'll see yes how

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,920
about vmware support and yeah you can do

00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:44,570
it as a client all right any other

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,980
questions all right well thank you very

00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,210
much for your attendance and if you have

00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:56,869
any other further questions will be

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:59,000
around your customers rely on your

00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:01,369
website or application if it's slower

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,280
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:06,140
and costs you money keeping your

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,630
business critical systems humming along

00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:12,450
requires insight into what they're doing

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,460
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,710
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,019
resource limitations and other problems

00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,789
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:23,400
your systems performance metrics in

00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:26,250
real-time and record this data for later

00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,230
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,240
see what's really going on under the

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,369
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,380
visualize the status of all your systems

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:37,109
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:40,230
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:42,690
memory swap processes load and network

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,269
usage click a specific system to access

00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,250
its individual dashboard then click and

00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:50,250
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,259
more detail comprehensive network data

00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,960
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:56,519
is available on the network tab and disk

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,440
rights and free space on the disk

00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:01,289
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,809
displays usage statistics for individual

00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:06,000
processes the system info tab shows

00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:08,250
listening services active connections

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,380
and available updates adding long view

00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,059
to a system is easy just click the

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,220
button copy the one line installation

00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:16,650
command then run the command on your

00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,359
linux system to complete the process the

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,549
agent will begin collecting data and

00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,370
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:24,950
start rolling

00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:27,320
use longview to gain visibility into

00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:31,060
your servers so when your website or app

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,060
heats up it stays up

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:39,309
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,260
ago we could not have imagined that

00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:43,450
asterisk would not only become the most

00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,609
widely adopted open source communication

00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,650
software on the planet but that it would

00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:50,170
impact the entire industry in the way

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,150
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,760
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,740
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,809
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,220
transition of power from the hands of

00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,500
the traditional proprietary phone

00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,900
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,819
administrators of phone systems using

00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,049
this power our customers have created

00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:10,000
all sorts of business changing

00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:11,859
applications from small office phone

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,349
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:15,970
to international carrier networks in

00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:17,770
fact there's even an entire country

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,349
those communications infrastructure runs

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,270
on Astor's the gym has always been about

00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,980
creating technology that expands

00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,170
communications capabilities in ways that

00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,369
we could never have imagined and that's

00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,740
part of what's game-changing about

00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:32,440
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,539
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,670
IP phones that extends control of the

00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:38,410
user all the way to the desktop the

00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,119
launch of these new products represents

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,130
the next phase indigenous history of

00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,619
innovation these are the first and only

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,970
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:47,650
power of esther's when we first

00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,880
discussed our expectations for building

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,770
a family of phones for use with

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,990
asterisks our requirements were pretty

00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,339
simple we asked the team to build the

00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,680
phones such that they were easy to

00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:58,839
install integrate provision and use I

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,910
think you'll soon agree our engineers

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,710
have delivered on that goal user

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,329
feedback is validating that when it

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:06,760
comes to operation with astro space

00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:08,710
systems including our own Switchvox

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,380
based product these are the easiest to

00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:13,720
use best integrated most interoperable

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,400
products on the market today the Digium

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,130
family of phones will initially include

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,049
three IP des hommes uniquely designed to

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,910
complement any asterisk or Switchvox

00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:24,010
based solution these phones are

00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,200
different for a number of reasons first

00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,480
there is clue sively designed for use

00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,099
with esters secondly we've made it

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,500
really easy to autodiscover and

00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:33,670
provision the phones next we've made it

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,190
easy for the phones to access

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,430
information inside of asterisks allowing

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,950
tight coupling between

00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,839
application and the phone additionally

00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:44,119
we've created an applications engine

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,339
that allows users and developers to

00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,069
create and run their own apps on the

00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:51,170
phone and finally we've done all of this

00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:52,880
at a very compelling price point at

00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,099
Digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,440
give our customers the best value in

00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,760
business phone systems and also give

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,829
them the power to create their own

00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,630
solutions or any communications

00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:04,309
challenge will continue to push the

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,020
boundaries not only to make Astra's

00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:08,000
cooler bastard more technologically

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,400
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,720
communications even easier and together

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,220
we'll change the way the world

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,220
communicates again

00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:44,940
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,100
way to better utilize all your resources

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,550
and it makes managing all your resources

00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:54,380
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,900
happening in open source the

00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:59,730
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,830
of the community and the speed at which

00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,810
these are these you know these these

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:06,119
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,970
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,970
that really shows the power of the of

00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:14,420
the open source community it is global

00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:17,970
and it's definitely because of the users

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:23,940
community people are extremely friendly

00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:25,680
and almost ready to help if you go on

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,869
tire see any day you'll see these guys

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,510
helping each other out and they're all

00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:32,190
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:35,210
product is transparent for everyone

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:38,369
everyone can look at the code base

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:40,610
everyone can see how close that is being

00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:46,140
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:49,050
everything is open in many ways it's

00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:55,170
absolutely vital to the tiangong health

00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:57,630
CloudStack the most exciting event in

00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:00,270
recent memory for me was our first

00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,910
developer boot camp

00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:05,550
and our call gave people I gave me two

00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:09,510
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:13,740
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:16,530
with 87 people and had to go get board

00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,050
chairs in the room twice everything

00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,380
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:25,380
is open source and so I don't think that

00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,120
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,150
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,880
computing and so i think it's i think

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,230
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,340
about cloud computing you're really

00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:40,890
talking about open source cloud

00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:43,920
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,050
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,340
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:53,010
in each data centers these hardware is

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:56,490
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:59,190
to handle number one that mass scale

00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:02,370
number two it's designed to handle the

00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:04,920
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:08,460
deployments started working on college

00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:11,790
attack over four years ago and it was

00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,490
the original set of people working on it

00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:18,600
add a background of delivering software

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:22,830
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:26,430
lots of users actually using it high

00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:29,520
availability is the key feature multiple

00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:31,530
hypervisors support different network

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,230
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,480
you better while steck management server

00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:40,170
can be deployed in different physical

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,820
machines it definitely has a huge

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:46,800
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:49,380
there's a major movie studio that they

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,710
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,690
to transcode video and i thought that

00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,310
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,580
more fascinating is what they did during

00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:02,370
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,750
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,290
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,440
the esta

00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:09,840
system go back to doing real work

00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,340
CloudStack is vast it touches so many

00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,230
different aspects and there's no one

00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,220
person that's kind of like a master of

00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:19,680
all those realms I think cloudstack as a

00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,930
project is going to be one of the

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,980
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:31,410
most feature fallen and and robust

00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:34,310
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,310
living through the clouds dag

00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:22,900
most enterprises today realize that

00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:24,580
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,950
enough to keep their network saved from

00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,990
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,030
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,160
popular lately that adds that extra

00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,830
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,600
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,820
know is that some two-factor

00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,010
authentication solutions they're better

00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:45,070
than others like two-factor strong

00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:47,320
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,300
beyond other authentication systems by

00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,360
being less expensive easier to implement

00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:54,820
and easier to use giving software-based

00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,670
token clients built to run on all major

00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,270
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,620
Android these tokens utilize a

00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:05,020
public/private key combination that's

00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,970
generated on device so there aren't any

00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:09,490
shared secrets flying around or

00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:12,370
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:14,230
special handling instead all keys are

00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,690
kept secure and private between the

00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,880
requesting token and your server which

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,500
you control a mouse making it the most

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,170
secure way possible to perform

00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:26,020
authentication encryption and with an

00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,750
extensive flexible API that support for
