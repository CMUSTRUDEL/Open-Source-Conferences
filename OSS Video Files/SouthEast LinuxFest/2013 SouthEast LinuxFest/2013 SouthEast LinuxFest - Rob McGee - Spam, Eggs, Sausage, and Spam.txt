00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:09,200
1997 era website Rob 0 no dns for us I

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:12,000
do try to do mail and DNS consulting and

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,420
various things set up VPNs whatever

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,840
people need i do linux geek work when i

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:26,360
can find it and i am the postmaster for

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:29,759
the slack builds org organization and

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:34,320
run the mail server there which kind of

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,329
small but but small enough to be able to

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,549
learn more than i ever wanted to learn

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:48,149
about spam and what we are dealing with

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:51,720
in the threats now I I should go to the

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,710
next slide here that's a page down in it

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,820
yeah

00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:03,170
okay though it helps to know who

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:06,680
spammers are do we have any of before we

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,690
go on I talked to at least a couple you

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,990
here or any of you run your own mail

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:14,020
server awesome good deal then this might

00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,640
be a partial interest you or any of you

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,270
foolish enough I mean fortunate enough

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,350
to catch my presentation last year no

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,640
good well I don't know if anybody

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:33,350
survived it I think I put them all to

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:35,690
sleep all right the spamhaus project

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:40,790
maintains a register of known spam

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:45,110
operations called rockzo and these are

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:52,280
the unrepentant the hardcore spammers of

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:55,700
the world this I haven't checked

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,040
recently but least as of last year they

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,140
said and i'm pretty sure it's about the

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,930
same number they said 100 known spam

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,380
operations are responsible for eighty

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:10,010
percent of the spam in the world in the

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:14,380
world there's a tiny number of people

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,380
are wrecking the internet for all of us

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:25,550
for many people email is just unusable

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:29,470
because of this garbage they figure that

00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:32,380
each of these spam gangs they call them

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,959
typically consist of 125 people so

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,690
you've got approximately 300 to 400 in

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,820
the world that do this so if you think

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,410
you've ever seen a spammer in person

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,410
chances are you have not

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:55,410
let's move on I had two whole days to

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,390
prepare for putting off my last minute

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,850
preparations and I managed to succeed at

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:07,980
that so I haven't really been over this

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:10,950
since last year okay now spammers what

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,880
they do they evolve in their tactics to

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:19,590
or their strategies to get into our

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:23,250
mailboxes and it's a cycle as the slide

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:26,150
shows the spammer start spamming male

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:30,500
administrators and in users identify

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:34,130
that is a source of spam the spammer

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,919
adapts to how we managed to avoid them

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:39,510
and it just goes on then we have to

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,750
change our strategies and that's what

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:49,320
this is about the changing strategies in

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:54,240
the recent past and still to a large

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,610
extent these are what spammers were

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,260
using these the set of tools here

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:04,440
they've got botnets of malware or rat

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,000
where Microsoft Windows machines you

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:13,370
know might as well say it that's what it

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,120
is it's windows they they get infected

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:24,560
in various attack vectors and usually

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,560
from les savy users

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,470
they do use free mail accounts to some

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:37,210
extent this is not as as Big the botnets

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:42,139
or their main vector I believe the last

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:46,400
credible estimate I saw was something

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:50,120
like 90 some percent of spam is coming

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,410
from botnets what we're going to get to

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,310
hear is how the botnets are evolving

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,320
anyway they've got the free mail

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,760
accounts they can sign up for they have

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:06,440
a software that has learned to how to

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:11,840
sign up for yahoo hotmail gmail accounts

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:14,210
and they get them in bulk some of them

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,080
will actually offer those accounts for

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:25,970
sale to other spammers when they in

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:30,740
their back channel forums some spammers

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:36,949
run their own mail services this is the

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:39,110
the can span people they actually these

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,060
are the ones that are easiest to block

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:45,080
because we can identify where they're

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:50,090
coming from almost all the rule of thumb

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:54,010
is if spam comes from an IP address only

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,010
span comes from that IP address

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,910
there has been known that spammers are

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:10,400
using cheap and unpaid labor in the

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:17,990
third world and via online games that

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:22,070
are solving CAPTCHA now this stupid

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:27,220
thing coming up here ok that worked okay

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,220
i need at five again and paint

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,750
um

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,670
alright

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:55,699
hey there we go that's that's the right

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:57,830
one in it yep okay this is about the

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,590
spam networks and as I said the direct

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,389
sending is is not as common anymore it's

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:08,840
probably under ten percent of all the

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:12,560
spam you're going to see and the what I

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:17,120
call you can spam law in the USA tried

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,789
to it was a law bought and paid for by

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,710
email marketers that tried to specify

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:28,460
certain ways in which theft and trespass

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,470
can be legal go figure I don't know I

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:34,729
mean I have not given these people

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:37,909
permission to use my mail server but

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,849
they say it's legal to be legal they

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:44,810
have to provide unsubscribe links in the

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:48,320
spam they have to provide a real sender

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:52,760
address for the spammer instead of that

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,820
it's coming from david's address at

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,029
hotmail com it's got to have a real

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,250
sender address that that they can

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:04,790
monitor and it has to have other contact

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:08,620
information like telephone and postal

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:12,550
mail if they meet those requirements

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:17,660
then they can use harvested list and

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:20,500
commit criminal trespass without somehow

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:24,040
being guilty of that I don't know how

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm not the lawyer

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:37,880
there are pink or what we call grey hat

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:40,610
spammers who they may have websites

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,080
where people can sign up for their

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:49,190
marketing or possibly email of interest

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:58,630
in some way like I know I had a user who

00:09:49,190 --> 00:10:04,130
signed up for some religious emails and

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,840
what these people do is they try to keep

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:12,140
their list clean but they they're not

00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:15,490
really doing it right the only real way

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:19,250
to maintain a mailing list is to confirm

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:23,930
the address the person submits their

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:27,560
contact information to you as the as the

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:31,780
sender you send a confirmation mail to

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,780
that address and nothing else nothing

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:40,940
the pink spammers will actually

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:45,320
subscribe you to the list with just the

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:47,270
web form this is not unusual the problem

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,040
with dealing with them is that some

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,260
people actually do subscribe to that

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,820
like I said my user with the religious

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,740
emails sometimes they're going to get

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,070
harvested addresses sometimes they're

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:05,330
going to get hostile people in Turing

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,920
addresses that don't belong but what

00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,720
they do when they get complaints as they

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,230
try to remove those what we call list

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,230
washing

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:26,839
snowshoe spam is a thing where spammers

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,749
have a large net lock this is getting

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,339
much more difficult for them that's what

00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:33,410
I said last year and it's even more

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:38,779
difficult now that we've run out of ipv4

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:42,800
their network space but what they try to

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:45,170
do is get a large net block and spread

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,100
out the sending over various IP

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:53,870
addresses in that Network I see these

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,339
people on IRC all the time and it's it's

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,040
frustrating of course they insist

00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:05,509
they're not spammers but they probably

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:09,860
are these networks are harder to be

00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:11,420
detected by the DNS block list that we

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:19,399
rely on like i mentioned Spamhaus

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:22,970
earlier and they're going to use if they

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:28,790
use a I said well camouflaged meaning if

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:33,350
the reverse DNS pointers of that net

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,120
block look respectable then it's hard to

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,519
identify and they're not going to get

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,579
listed and these people are likely to

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,559
end up in your mailbox but like I said

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:46,490
it's getting more expensive to have

00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,079
those large net blocks and it's not

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,970
working as well for them as it had in

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,970
the past they're moving away from this

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,420
briefly we're in touch on the free mail

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:06,139
accounts here the accounts that were

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:09,679
created to be used for spam a lot of

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:12,559
times that an account will just be used

00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:19,999
for a single spam run they can pump in a

00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:23,120
a mailing list to that account it's

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,329
going to take a while for the for the

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,500
free mail provider to detect it oh hey

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:33,740
we're being we're sending spam

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,450
and when they do detect it well they're

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,310
going to lock out the account and then

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,110
that spam run ends doesn't matter

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,770
they're going to just continue on the

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:50,330
next account and keep keep on doing the

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:52,880
same thing the more what we're seeing

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:58,580
now though are the accounts was stolen

00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:03,440
credentials we've had I run I'm one of

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:07,990
the co administrators of a spam mailing

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:12,920
list called spammers don't like us and

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:16,370
we've even had them I accidentally

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,640
approved one as moderator when it came

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,530
in it was from a colleague of mine in UK

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,420
and I recognized his name and I thought

00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:27,110
well that can't be we should have had

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,940
him unmoderated so I just didn't even

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,640
read what was there and clicked sinned

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:36,020
and and i spammed people all over the

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,430
world on a spam mailing list but it it

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,650
actually set off an interesting

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,770
discussion and he did not realize i

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:49,640
believe it was a gmail account this guy

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:52,160
is a dot edu k a very savvy user he's

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,530
not your typical person we never did

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,250
figure out how his account got hijacked

00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:00,410
but it did when they do get into

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,320
somebody's account what are they going

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,910
to find there they're going to find

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,940
addresses of everyone you've sent mail

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:14,690
to you don't suppose they're going to

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:18,220
use that of course they will recipients

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:23,360
may have whitelisted the sender address

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:29,420
sender addresses in email are not safe

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:33,530
for white listing the thing is you

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,930
anyone can send mail as any email

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,480
address you can set up your client to do

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,800
that that's getting more difficult with

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,720
things like SP

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:48,700
and DKIM and if you don't know what

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,800
these are that's sender policy framework

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,870
which I'm not much of a believer in so

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,160
that's why it took me a while domainkeys

00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,200
identified male which was yay whose

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:06,320
standard which is a more worthwhile but

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:09,380
does the same thing so it's getting more

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,829
difficult to do that but a lot of times

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:16,459
you're going to see a sender address

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:26,990
that isn't that cinder in fact that's

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:29,269
the case with most spam we now into the

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:35,029
botnets this is as I said this is the

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:39,290
big tool that they're relying on the

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:42,350
most and it's evolving but they are

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:47,000
Microsoft Windows machines with one of

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:50,930
two basic types of malware I said rat

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,630
lair that's a little maze I put on there

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:57,680
so I thought that looked appropriate

00:16:53,630 --> 00:17:02,930
when I slap that together last year the

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:08,949
first kind of this is waning the direct

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:14,050
to MX sending that is where a spambot

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:19,040
looks up the mail exchanger address for

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:27,199
their victim list and they connect

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:32,050
directly to port 25 on the MX host well

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,050
a lot of these windows machines are at

00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:47,499
end-user IP address there there at

00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:49,929
dynamic ISPs in there in many cases the

00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:52,210
port 25 is being blocked by a lot of

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:57,249
ISPs I don't know exactly how many i

00:17:52,210 --> 00:18:01,720
believe comcast does now AT&T my own

00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:04,659
little ISP does at home you can't get

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,369
out on port 25 from most home

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:11,109
connections anymore is that something

00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:17,679
you all are familiar with or any of you

00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:22,330
yeah bellsouth right we have verizon

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,820
does to charter of residential yeah some

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,739
of them will unblock you on port 25 if

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,379
you have a reason to ask but generally

00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:31,840
you've got to have a business class

00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:33,190
internet connection to do that and if

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,100
you have a business class connection

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:41,799
you're going to get custom reverse DNS

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:43,480
set and you have other than that they're

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:52,059
just say you don't have reason to be

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:54,909
sending me yeah charter says its

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:57,999
violation of terms of services to run a

00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:02,320
server at your house which you know I

00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:04,029
have opinions on that but I mean you're

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,950
not doing much different with a mail

00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:09,639
server at your home than you are doing

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:15,279
with Thunderbird you're using the same

00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:17,230
protocols but you know it's just they

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,970
could come on you for a Terms of Service

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,840
violation as you said now the new threat

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:28,060
and

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,840
and I say new this actually it's a cycle

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:35,410
this this was the way they used to do it

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,780
back in the in the 90s it was more

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,380
common and then it faded out in favor of

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:47,140
direct to MX sending but they are

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:52,050
relaying through the Microsoft mail user

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,940
agents usually Outlook Outlook Express

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:59,920
windows mail or whatever they call it I

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:03,850
don't know but these I call the enemy

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,160
within this is when you have as a mail

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:10,150
server administrator if you've got these

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:17,530
windows users and they get infected you

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:20,260
have a big problem it's happening on

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,600
phones now too I personally seen clients

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,340
phones get it and next thing you know

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,100
they're leaking and financials and

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,230
relaying over there okay phones getting

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,140
root kitted and relaying imap

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,590
credentials you know what kind of phones

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,590
those are

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:46,869
android and iphone more commonly the

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:55,090
Android okay with direct to MX rat where

00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:57,820
who has the problem the originating site

00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:05,919
does have a problem they're spewing out

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:09,529
spam from their hosts they they are

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:14,480
likely to get blacklisted in fact that's

00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:20,869
what many of the blacklists exist to do

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:24,919
is to focus on these zombies that are

00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:27,379
currently relaying outbound but it's not

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,799
a big problem for the original

00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:34,100
originating site usually all they need

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:38,149
to do is block their port 25 outbound

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,549
like most ISPs are doing already I've

00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:45,460
had this happen at a small business site

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:48,409
i worked at in dallas texas that

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,830
suddenly one day we wake up and find out

00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:53,299
that our users are getting rejection

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,779
notices that they're not their mail

00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,960
isn't going out oops i forgot to block

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:03,350
port 25 on the firewall okay i fixed

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,359
that I fixed that and two days later we

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,359
were pretty much off all the black most

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:21,730
users of remote mail services should be

00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:25,100
using the submission port 587 like

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:29,779
there's no way you can connect to gmail

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,820
on port 25 for most isp's you need to be

00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,929
using 587 and you shouldn't have any

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,389
problem now you're going to have to

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:37,480
authenticate there you're not going to

00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:41,560
be able to they're not going to take

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,930
direct to MX spam that way it's not

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:48,820
mail to gmail users but they're going to

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:49,810
take mail from gmail users the next

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,630
thing you're going to have to do when

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:55,150
you got this direct DMX rat where it's

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,230
your signage is clean up your viruses as

00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:01,690
I mentioned the site in Dallas I just

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:07,060
blocked 25 out and i set the firewall to

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:09,340
log hits from it and soon enough we had

00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:14,040
a list of about five IP addresses inside

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:17,470
that were the problem we went and

00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:22,480
applied the lard to the users and

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,190
everything was fine as I mentioned

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,510
before to the receiving site isn't going

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:31,240
to have any big problems with this

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:35,310
because of the DNS block lists that are

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,310
very effective at detecting these

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:50,980
spamhaus Zen list includes the CBL the

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:53,620
composite blocklist it which is going to

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,810
list all these the Barracuda BR BL is

00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:02,200
the Barracuda reputation blacklist which

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:06,310
is compiled by Barracuda devices that

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,870
they sell they have created lots of

00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,290
problems with those devices but now

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:19,920
they're given something back with a good

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:19,920
usable DNS blacklist now

00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:27,909
behavioral property detection refers to

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:31,809
the fact that a spam zombie is not like

00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:38,169
a real mail transfer agent it is not

00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:42,519
going to behave as well in in speaking

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:45,070
the SMTP protocol to your server the

00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:52,350
ways you could trip them up include the

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:56,200
grey listing which is where an unknown

00:24:52,350 --> 00:25:00,429
client connects you simply give it a

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,080
temporary failure try again later then

00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:03,510
when they try again later you let them

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,909
through because you've seen them before

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:09,760
most many of these direct dmx zombies

00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:15,789
did not try again I don't recommend gray

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,980
listing these days but it it was

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,590
effective in its day and it still does

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:24,279
trip up a lot one thing you can get from

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:27,179
gray listing is you give the DNS block

00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:29,710
list a little more time to detect it and

00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:37,600
often times in a half hours time they're

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:42,600
going to know greet pause is according

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:46,149
to the SMTP protocol the server gives a

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:50,380
banner greeting to the client the client

00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:53,529
is not allowed to speak before that it

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,139
sees that banner many of these zombies

00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,429
are not even capable of seeing the

00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,289
banner they're just one way

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:01,029
communication and they're just going to

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:05,260
try to spew it out as quickly as they

00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:07,630
can they may have built-in delays or

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:12,870
they may not but we see this regularly

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:16,720
in the logs is that some zombie has

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:19,269
spoken out of turn that's what it

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,000
amounts to if they speak out of turn we

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:27,760
know there is Ombey real mail servers

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,740
don't do this I find on the vast

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,360
majority of those by the way that

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,360
they're already listed in the blacklist

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:42,890
MX priority violations a lot of people a

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:46,540
lot of sites will use different priority

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,650
levels of their mail exchanger the

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:52,610
protocol says you're supposed to go to

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:55,150
the lowest numbered priority but

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:58,360
spammers got the idea a long time ago

00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:00,950
hmm maybe these higher priority ones

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,430
they're probably just a backup and they

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,760
don't really do the same sort of spam

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:11,750
control that the lower the main MX is

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,700
going to do that still works a lot a lot

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:17,030
of sites you're going to get through by

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,130
going to that secondary MX and this is

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,200
something i also see on IRC all the time

00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:24,020
and tell people you don't want a

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:29,780
secondary MX it is what we call a spam

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:34,630
magnet it doesn't work now mine I use

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:39,290
and I don't have this on the slides but

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:42,500
I'm going to give you a link to my post

00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:45,740
screen configuration but mine I have two

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:49,310
IP addresses on the domains I host and I

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:53,990
have one of them dot 211 is the primary

00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:56,540
and dot 214 is the secondary post screen

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,250
will detect if the connection comes to

00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,070
the secondary before it has seen you

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:04,130
before if you hit the secondary it's not

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,340
going to consider you a candidate for

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:10,120
whitelisting it's going to just tell you

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,120
to come back later

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:20,520
alright this is about dealing with the

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:24,090
direct TMX rat wareham it's as I said

00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:29,550
it's pretty easy to do port 25 is being

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:34,170
blocked by most increasing number of

00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:36,180
end-user ISPs the IP reputation of the

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:41,730
connecting client is pretty easy to

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:48,210
determine the spam house pbl is the

00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:52,290
policy block list and ISPs are going to

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:55,670
submit a whole large net blocks to them

00:28:52,290 --> 00:29:00,240
that they say should not be sending mail

00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:03,090
most isp's and even even some hosters I

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,480
don't know if like leno does this we

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:09,990
have any linode people in here Andrew

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:16,760
you might know you don't know but a lot

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:21,300
of the these sites colocation sites and

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:24,960
VPS providers are going to have their IP

00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:27,120
space in the policy block list which

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,250
means it doesn't really mean that you

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,960
can't send mail from there but it means

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,110
that you're going to have to go to the

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,600
trouble to set it up right you you've

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:42,230
got to you've got to get your reverse

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:45,720
DNS setup you've got to go to spam house

00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:48,240
website you've got to submit your

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,680
information to them and they're going to

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,900
check it out and they'll remove you from

00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:57,450
the ppl and then you'll be able to send

00:29:51,900 --> 00:30:04,200
mail the detected spew CBL as I

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:07,050
mentioned before go ahead it they have

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,020
does this get propagated with a DNS list

00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:14,880
he says propagation is not a real DNS

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:19,390
term it

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:22,029
right yes it is distributed they have I

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:26,520
don't know I think it's about 13 or

00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:28,539
maybe more in s hosts worldwide and

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,240
actually it's probably much more than

00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:34,440
that because I think each of their NS

00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,669
records has multiple IP addresses

00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,399
Spamhaus is probably one of the biggest

00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:42,450
in the world in terms of the DNS queries

00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:42,450
that they hit and

00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,340
is there a threshold of are you are you

00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:06,740
asking how spamhaus determines they are

00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,900
very tight-lipped about how they

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,740
determine this I have figured out a few

00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:16,340
things that I know that if if you have a

00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:19,210
legitimate mail server using a non fully

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,070
qualified domain name as your hello

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,990
value if anybody is familiar with smtp

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:30,860
that's what the client says client says

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:35,090
hello I'm this is my hostname if that

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:37,850
host name is not fully qualified if in

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,130
other words like my host name is Harry

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:43,100
or slack builds org if it was just to

00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:46,820
say hello Harry er no that's not going

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:51,350
to work it has to say hello harrier

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:56,000
slack builds org and that was that is

00:31:51,350 --> 00:32:00,820
one of the criteria that CBL uses to

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,870
detect they also but more more than that

00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:09,650
they've got thousands of spam trap

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:13,730
addresses throughout many domains in the

00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:17,210
world and these are highly secret nobody

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:19,790
is supposed to know these addresses they

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:23,090
end up they get published on web pages

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:28,480
and use net and they get harvested by

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:31,550
the by the address harvesting BOTS and

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,840
soon enough they're going to be getting

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:43,450
spam and and the client list is sending

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,450
it gets listed reverse DNS is another

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,140
tactic we can use against the director

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,430
MX rat where because some of them have

00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,430
no pointer value set at all

00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,760
many of them are going to have a dynamic

00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:04,250
looking one like oh I don't know or I

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:11,060
can't think of a good example but dot

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:25,790
res dot RR com and it's going to have

00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:29,320
pieces of the yes yeah right yeah the IP

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:32,690
address itself or portions of it and dot

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,090
city state or whatever whatever each ISP

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,430
has their own ways of doing this but you

00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,340
can tell at a glance that hey that's a

00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:47,150
that's an end-user IP address that's not

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:49,370
a custom pointer for a mail server and a

00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:53,990
lot of time now this pointer in a

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:57,230
mismatch this is a not really a safe way

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,760
to block spam but it's it is very it's

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:05,060
effective it's going to take out a lot

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:10,640
of non spam but a lot of sites don't

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:14,810
have what we call fully or forward

00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:17,090
confirmed reverse DNS so when they get

00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,640
the you get the point of value when you

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,460
look up the IP address in the reverse

00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,460
DNS you're going to look up the mail

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,690
server is going to look up the that host

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:31,580
name also and ideally that IP address is

00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,330
going to be one of the ones returned for

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:39,200
that hosting if not there's a mismatch

00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:43,399
and that could be a reason that more

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,780
aggressive sites could use to block like

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,590
I said you're going to lose some real

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:51,590
mail doing that but it is effective um

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,840
and as I mentioned before the behavior

00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,600
the Miss implementation of standards

00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:00,950
that these zombies have to do it's a big

00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:04,460
challenge to these programmers of the

00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,319
rat where to get something that is going

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:10,359
to

00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:14,019
be small enough to hopefully not get

00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:16,180
detected right away and not getting the

00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:19,089
user's way too badly although they don't

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,839
really care much about that because they

00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:28,779
know they have limited time in their

00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:31,269
window of opportunity basically now we

00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:36,489
get to the subject of the talk is the

00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:41,410
relaying rat where the enemy within this

00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:43,209
is a sticky situation when you are the

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:51,309
mail server administrator and one of

00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:53,589
your users has this stuff the denial of

00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:56,440
service now some of you may have seen me

00:35:53,589 --> 00:36:01,839
around the Convention and I've been

00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:04,690
packing heat this is my squirt gun some

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,459
of you may also know that in my spare

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,410
time I'm a volunteer firefighter and I

00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:15,489
get to drive the great big pumper truck

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:18,609
lots of fun those two devices serve the

00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:22,589
same basic purpose do they not it is to

00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:28,209
deliver a stream of water at a target

00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:33,910
okay this is aunt betty sending you an

00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:39,130
email my fire truck is what this rattler

00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:42,190
is going to do and it literally is going

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,589
to pump out as much as it can as fast as

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,049
it can they know they've got a very

00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:49,690
small window of opportunity and they're

00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:51,789
going to take advantage of that they're

00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:55,509
going to they know that you are a

00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:57,640
legitimate mail server they've got some

00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:03,729
real credentials that they're being able

00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:06,459
to use to relay and remote sites are

00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:09,039
likely to accept that mail at least at

00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:14,410
first before they have detected that

00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:16,150
that is a spam source so you're going to

00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,500
get a denial of service simply by your

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,540
your pipe is going to be

00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,240
saturated you can get more denial a

00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:26,890
service because you very quickly become

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:30,760
listed and you find that when you have

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:34,960
legitimate mail to send nobody wants it

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,960
you're going to get everything rejected

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,109
both sites have the problem with

00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:46,550
relaying rat where as i said the

00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:48,349
originating site is going to get

00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:52,609
blacklisted and the fixes are not easy

00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:54,589
you've got to block that that sender you

00:37:52,609 --> 00:38:02,690
got to revoke those credentials you've

00:37:54,589 --> 00:38:04,250
got to stop your spew going out you've

00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:09,619
got to get yourself off those black

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:11,599
lists which in the case of CBL and

00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:14,359
Barracuda it's probably going to take a

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,140
day or two I don't know exactly they

00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:24,710
don't want to tell you these details an

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:26,270
hour to okay not item shows right if

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,250
you're still spewing you're going to get

00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:32,180
relisted with more stringent

00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,359
requirements to get off the list go

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,359
ahead

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:44,960
really is no excuse curing out spam ever

00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,970
when is simple this block you know the

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,460
only thing about us and email out how is

00:38:46,970 --> 00:39:03,740
your spam filter using the sonicwall and

00:38:52,460 --> 00:39:08,960
i can't i use that if the messages okay

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:10,880
no it's exactly it rather than repeat

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,830
all that i'm just going to say you're

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,540
getting ahead of me here but yes you're

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:18,800
right you're right there's no excuse to

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,970
be spewing this out it's it's there are

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,250
things you can do and we're going to

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:30,550
cover that here bro momentarily thanks

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:33,220
for coming Bob let's see you okay

00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,640
now the receiving side has different set

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:40,170
of challenges also the DNS block lists

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,140
are not going to help you at first and

00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:47,230
suppose that you're using DNS whitelist

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:52,450
also which is something that is also

00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:57,100
growing in use you're going to cancel

00:39:52,450 --> 00:40:01,030
out these DNS BL hits with your with

00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:04,090
your whitelist the behavior problem

00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:06,400
detection you're not going to have your

00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:16,240
your early talker you're not going to

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:21,040
have your i'm trying to think those

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,290
other well anyway the protocol

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,610
violations that many of these zombies do

00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:28,810
are just not going to happen because

00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:33,340
this is a real MTA this is well written

00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:38,580
software running on a real internet

00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:40,780
hosts so anyway in the first hour to a

00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:44,320
lot of this is going to end up in some

00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:49,090
users in boxes so you're going to have

00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:55,210
unhappy users as the receiving side how

00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:57,010
do we mitigate this this is what you

00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,260
were talking about here is is how you

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:05,760
mitigate this at the sending the

00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:11,230
originating site first step and this is

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,810
really very important a lot of hobbyist

00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:18,070
sites probably don't do this but but you

00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:20,760
should you need to separate your MX

00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:24,130
strain the inbound from other sites

00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:29,050
across the world from your submission

00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:30,970
stream which is your users they have

00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:35,190
different filtering requirements you're

00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:39,010
going to have to do you can't apply

00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:41,380
things like non fully qualified hello

00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,920
checks against your users because well a

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,230
lot of these

00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:52,010
male user agents might not do that they

00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:54,750
might not do that right you have to

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:57,779
require authentication from your users

00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,690
what this is going to do is help you a

00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:03,809
lot in pinpointing where your problem is

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:07,819
you've got to know if you're just

00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:14,700
allowing relay from an IP range which

00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:15,809
many sites still do you don't know it's

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,299
going to be harder for you to identify

00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:20,010
the user with the problem it's going to

00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:25,230
be harder to get them disconnected and

00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:29,130
shut off rate-limiting is what you were

00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:32,029
mentioning you said 200 per hours what

00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,029
you use and

00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:53,010
200 and our is probably difficult for

00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:58,160
most humans to reach really if you if

00:42:53,010 --> 00:43:02,160
you send a reply in your Thunderbird 2

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:08,190
if you hit reply all that's going to be

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:18,990
a single email oh it counts each

00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:22,050
recipient okay okay right rate limiting

00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:24,210
at the firewall not the MTI um did I get

00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,760
this thing plugged in I don't think it's

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:32,990
so I'm afraid I'm running low on battery

00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:38,780
there it says it's plugged yeah ah

00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:41,660
that's the problem right there sorry

00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,059
okay

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:49,609
well better get this done before the

00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:51,500
battery dies content filtering now

00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:54,260
there's different requirements of

00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,420
content filtering what you're going to

00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:01,579
get from outside versus what you're

00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:02,809
going to send out when you stuff that

00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,039
comes in from outside you're going to be

00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,839
able to look at your received headers

00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,510
and determine which ones look like

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:12,710
forgeries for one thing you're going to

00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:14,180
be able to well there's numerous more

00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:17,180
tools you can use I'm not really

00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:20,150
familiar with that the content side of

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,339
things but I do know that on the on the

00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:27,680
submission stuff what you want to look

00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:30,710
at is a URI BL the URI block list most

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,099
spam is going to have an HTTP link in it

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:44,030
that they want the victim to click you

00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:47,599
can look that up and that will that will

00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:50,240
be listed in one of these URI block list

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,770
that's a real effective way of detecting

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,079
that this is spam coming from your user

00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:59,119
and bottom line this is going to go over

00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:03,109
well at a Linux conference discouraged

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,940
use of Microsoft moods well as as has

00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:08,299
been pointed out we were having problem

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:11,720
with Android devices now to anti phones

00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:17,420
so that's not going to be a silver

00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:19,849
bullet but it doesn't hurt if you can

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,400
promote thunderbird thunderbird behaves

00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:26,240
pretty well under most operating systems

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:30,279
and that's going to be a lot less

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,279
vulnerable to compromise

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,170
you know I think I got ahead of myself i

00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,790
went over these later slides i said we

00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:49,800
need to separate the MX mail from

00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:52,230
submission you support 587 is going to

00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,310
get around the firewall blocking that

00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:58,859
these ISPs are doing some people are

00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,609
going to have like and I suppose you're

00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:04,680
an ISP and you've got you did it wrong

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:07,260
20 years ago and you've got users that

00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,910
are on port 25 and it's going to be a

00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,080
big political issue to get them off it

00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:14,609
it's not hard to separate your stream

00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,859
anyway because all you have to do is put

00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:19,710
them on a different IP address they

00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:22,470
don't that doesn't need the name that

00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:34,530
your users are using does not need to be

00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:37,770
the same as your MX host name okay when

00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:40,440
you require authentication for your

00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:44,420
users to send mail it makes it slightly

00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:48,420
more difficult for the for the Rattler

00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:52,350
this is why what a lot of it does is

00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:55,770
they've got an API that controls outlet

00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:57,869
from behind the scenes and they're going

00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:00,900
to be able to there's still going to be

00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:04,140
able to send mail just as the user does

00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:07,080
but some of it might not do that quite

00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,300
right so it doesn't hurt and as I

00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,940
pointed out you're going to be able to

00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:16,200
identify the affected user much more

00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:18,420
quickly and accurately and easier to put

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:25,260
a stop to the spew that you're going to

00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:31,710
be sending now on the rate limiting how

00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:33,869
much does typical user sinned well it's

00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,030
pretty hard to type out even if you're

00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:36,859
going through an inbox and forwarding

00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,410
everything

00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:44,720
to a whole bunch of people it's really

00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:51,549
hard for a limit like 200 an hour to be

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:53,930
reached by a human user what I say you

00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:56,599
shoot first and ask questions later

00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:59,329
you're going to just tell your users

00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:00,799
that you're limited to 200 or you don't

00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:05,630
even have tell them what the exact limit

00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:07,940
is just say that if you exceed what we

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:11,390
consider a normal usage you're going to

00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:12,920
find that your account is suspended now

00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,920
they could maybe they're not sending

00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,480
spam but it's not likely if they're

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,730
going to be hitting something like 200

00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,730
an hour they are likely a spam zombie

00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,809
you check it out that's what that's when

00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:35,029
you read the logs and find out what's

00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:37,970
going on I'm a postfix user myself and

00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:43,400
these are the rate-limiting tools that

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:45,349
we have available now you mentioned a

00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,249
firewall sonicwall now this is not

00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:56,210
something that I've messed with but I'm

00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:58,839
going to look into that okay okay spam

00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:02,619
filter in front of the mail server

00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:06,049
there's a milter limit which these are

00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:12,880
milter zar from send mail originally but

00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:16,160
postfix has added support for those and

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,880
then postfix has its own policy protocol

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:25,910
and I listed three policy services that

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:31,989
are available post FWD I believe stands

00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:36,259
for firewall demon which post FWD org

00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:37,970
that's written in Python and it's able

00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:39,980
to do various intelligent things and

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:44,780
it's very simple to figure out you just

00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:48,840
you just give it criteria if

00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:52,880
authentication user has been seen more

00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:58,650
than 200 times an hour you it will

00:49:52,880 --> 00:50:03,860
refuse the mail from that user policy d

00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:07,500
is there's two versions of that and I

00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:13,530
think the original was in Pearl and I

00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:15,990
think the replacement is in c that's not

00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:22,260
what I've used but it's it's also able

00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:26,340
to do these type of decisions nice ql

00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,920
gray is actually great listing demon and

00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:30,870
I'm not oh yes it does do rate limiting

00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,800
also that's why I put it up there

00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:39,810
because throttling is the feature they

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:44,600
call it but SQL gray exists for gray

00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:44,600
listing but it they have added that on

00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:58,170
I'm going to quickly go over some do's

00:50:50,520 --> 00:51:00,540
and don'ts of content filtering for mail

00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:02,190
from your users you one thing you

00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,850
definitely want to do as I mentioned is

00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:09,410
the URI BL test another thing is you can

00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:13,410
look at the content and spamassassin

00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:17,520
guys have spent way too many hours

00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:22,950
reading all this junk and trying to find

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:27,450
patterns signs that indicate that this

00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:29,940
content is spam what you don't want to

00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:35,520
do is look at the received headers and

00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:40,280
apply DNS BL test to that your user is

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:44,760
submitting from say they're in a hotel a

00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:48,510
lot of these hotels get their wireless

00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,890
access listed on these block list but

00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:53,619
they don't block 25 because they

00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:56,769
high paying customers that they want to

00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,390
be able to reach the Internet well if

00:51:56,769 --> 00:52:05,440
you're looking at the received headers

00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:08,019
from places like that it's going to it's

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:13,180
going to be meaningless and you can

00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:16,599
actually block real mail that way white

00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:20,710
listing is not a good idea your sender

00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:23,160
addresses are this is what the rat where

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:26,200
is going to use and said it knows the

00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:31,089
real sender address to use and that's

00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:36,700
what it's going to do and known good

00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:39,640
clients would be hit by that now we're

00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:42,160
going to quickly go over the content

00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:46,240
filtering tools that are available for

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:51,660
postfix and it there's others as I said

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:57,190
mill ters for send mail are supported

00:52:51,660 --> 00:53:05,069
but these are the tools that I use and

00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:05,069
recommend a Mavis T new is a pearl based

00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:11,740
content filtering framework it's not

00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:18,579
actually a content filter but it invokes

00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:24,400
the spam assassin perl modules within

00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:30,220
the same emmaus process am a dusty spam

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,950
assassin which is an Apache project blue

00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:39,759
on blue didn't work out too well did it

00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:44,309
sorry about that spam assassin is the

00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:49,299
brains of the content filtering of

00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:51,130
emmaus d new and you can also use anti

00:53:49,299 --> 00:53:57,330
viruses like clam

00:53:51,130 --> 00:54:01,420
AV in my own experience I have not

00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:04,330
gotten much from clamavi but it's free

00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:09,040
software it's good stuff it's worth

00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:11,230
having you're going to catch a few clam

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,390
used to be good but at this point is far

00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:15,400
more likely to actually break your

00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,740
filtering process because they

00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,890
deliberately broke the binary once you

00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:25,120
get new updates I remember that yes he

00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:27,490
points out that clam did is that every

00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,920
version upgrade they have no it's just

00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:31,270
whenever they get a while yes I know

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,220
they've done that before and that was

00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:36,430
pretty irresponsible but they had a

00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:39,030
version where they didn't maintain

00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:42,940
backward compatibility and if you

00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:45,010
weren't paying close attention it was

00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,630
the the database update wasn't it yeah

00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:52,930
that didn't work with the older version

00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:55,810
of the software they deliberately

00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:58,150
crafted it to crash the older binary at

00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,680
least as importantly I finally just

00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,210
people that was the last straw for me

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,730
because I look at my stats in the last

00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:07,690
two years in client I was running clam

00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:10,390
behind spamassassin chain and clam had

00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:14,380
caught a whopping two bales two males

00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:18,850
officiousness gets the batsman yes yes I

00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:22,480
had similar experiences to you that yeah

00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:26,970
now I was running clam in front of Mavis

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:30,640
the new runs it considers the virus a

00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:32,890
higher priority to block but I wasn't

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,450
finding as much what was blocking the

00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:39,970
viruses was my post screen my MTA

00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:45,610
filtering they just weren't getting to a

00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:48,190
Mavis d and yeah I agree it's it's a was

00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:50,180
the Maytag repairman sitting around

00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:55,010
doing nothing back when when

00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:57,950
running man but ok I'll love I'll

00:55:55,010 --> 00:56:03,590
rethink that for next year from going to

00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:08,590
do the same boring presentation again ok

00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:14,210
if you get caught unprepared by all this

00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:17,930
what are you going to do well the first

00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:22,940
step to do and pointy head bosses don't

00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:27,920
like this but you got to do it stop your

00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:32,800
MTA do not send your junk out everything

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:35,240
in your queue has been rejected by

00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:41,840
legitimate mail servers all over the

00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:44,990
world you must stop the abuse if you

00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:50,600
don't you're not getting mail out anyway

00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:53,510
so what's the point stop it those logs

00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:56,720
are going screaming by faster than

00:56:53,510 --> 00:57:00,680
anyone can possibly read them you just

00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:05,060
can't you've got to get the abuse stop

00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:08,270
right away the way smtp works is you're

00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:10,970
going to find your legitimate sites are

00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:14,510
going to cue the mail that they have

00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:17,570
coming to you so you're not likely to

00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:21,530
lose much if anything at all if you can

00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:27,230
get it back running soon another thing

00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:30,050
you can do relatively safely is to just

00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:36,020
stop the outbound sending just turn off

00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:42,430
your smtpclient in your MTA in postfix

00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:42,430
their means of doing that would be Oh

00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:48,710
differ transports but there's other ways

00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,180
you can do it if you want to do the

00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:54,970
quick and dirty thing you can just block

00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:58,320
your port 25 going out that is

00:57:54,970 --> 00:58:02,370
connections to port 25 from your server

00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:05,790
that works too but like I said your logs

00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:07,560
are going to be screaming by and it's a

00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:11,130
whole lot easier if you can just get it

00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:13,740
stopped for a little while you're going

00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,650
to have to get those logs to where you

00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:20,790
can identify the offending user if

00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:25,170
you're logging who authenticated this

00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:27,650
will be real easy to do you disable that

00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:29,520
account and then you go to that user

00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:35,310
assuming that you're the one responsible

00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:38,910
for their MTA you remove their rat where

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:42,510
from their machine or phone as the case

00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:44,790
may be next thing you're going to need

00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,590
to do well not necessarily in order but

00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:49,980
you're going to have to identify and

00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:51,840
delete or hold the the spams that are in

00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:58,260
the queue they're all going to be from

00:58:51,840 --> 00:59:00,390
the same user most likely not

00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,400
necessarily though you're going to have

00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:09,500
to look at what's in your queue and it's

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:12,600
it's a big job before you restart your

00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,670
outbound sending before you restart your

00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,490
MPA you're going to have to look at

00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,800
these spam lists and see if you're still

00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:24,630
on it because if you are what's the

00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:27,330
point Spamhaus Zen is used by a large

00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:31,290
number of sites worldwide and and you're

00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:34,740
not going to get much mail out if you're

00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:36,150
on it then for a while after that you're

00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:39,450
going to have to just keep on top of

00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:40,830
things and watch logs for other

00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,210
rejections you can get what if you've

00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:45,470
been added to private block list

00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:47,850
somewhere some people will do that some

00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:49,830
small usually smaller and more

00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,390
aggressive sites but sometimes bigger

00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:53,310
sites are going to have automated ways

00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:56,700
of detecting this and they're going to

00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:58,320
blacklist you there you got to set up

00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:04,280
the mitigation strategies that we

00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:04,280
discussed that's your last step and

01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:10,330
and that other step is to contact rob 0

01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:15,220
and I help you with this but it won't be

01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:18,570
cheap all right we have completed and I

01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:23,950
think everybody survived without pillows

01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:35,349
are there any questions any to mate

01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:39,190
Rotten Tomatoes yes sir yes mail

01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:41,290
forwarding what are my thoughts on mail

01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:46,450
forwarding my thoughts are you can't get

01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:48,690
away with that in 2013 people he says

01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:51,880
that they're at an edu and they got

01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:54,940
users that want to get all their mail in

01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:58,450
their gmail mailbox here's what's going

01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:00,609
to happen you're going to you're going

01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:02,020
to relay spam you're going to you're

01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:06,640
going to get spammed for that address

01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:08,770
even if you're doing really good spam

01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:12,750
avoidance nothing is going to be perfect

01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:17,800
you're going to relay some spam to gmail

01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:20,410
and gmail is going to say you're the

01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:24,000
spammer it's difficult to get away with

01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:28,359
that these days you could I suppose

01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,180
encapsulate you know resubmit it as your

01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:35,380
own local sender in like I'm attached

01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:38,349
the message to and resubmit it through

01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:43,270
your own send mail in the doc go and

01:01:38,349 --> 01:01:44,830
file it depends what kind of delivery

01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:47,140
agent you're using whether you're going

01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:49,359
to be able to do that very easily but no

01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:52,200
these days that's very difficult same

01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:54,970
envelope forwarding is going to break

01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:59,280
dkim it's going to break SPF that a lot

01:01:54,970 --> 01:02:02,280
of people are are using to determine

01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,280
spam

01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:12,520
span out of your dress to be warned

01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,520
about getting blacklisted

01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:25,299
that's true I mean if you you could what

01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:28,660
you could do is just apply a whole lot

01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:31,650
more aggressive spam filtering to these

01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:33,969
males that you're going to forward

01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:37,509
you're going to have to say that some

01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:39,189
false positives are acceptable and and

01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:41,739
then you could possibly be reasonably

01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:45,309
safe you're going to have a few that are

01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:47,799
going to get through but you can work on

01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:49,660
develop you can have a awesome ated way

01:02:47,799 --> 01:02:52,749
of detecting that I've got something

01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:55,109
that's being rejected I need to take

01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:57,549
some action on that and you can suspend

01:02:55,109 --> 01:03:00,339
you can set something up that's going to

01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:01,839
hold these suspicious males and so

01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:03,279
you're not going to keep bombarding them

01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:09,939
with the same content over and over

01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:12,039
again yeah anything else I just want to

01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:14,589
point out there's just because I've run

01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:16,029
into this it's been giant in the but if

01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:18,819
you do end up an issue you get

01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:22,420
blacklisted with spew my common tools go

01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:24,910
to Antibes org the multi rbl check there

01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:27,279
is a new med new ish or veal they showed

01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:29,079
up but it's not there it doesn't show up

01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:31,839
on multi rbl check it's called a nail

01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:33,729
spike male star they are really annoying

01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,849
because they do not honor deal with

01:03:33,729 --> 01:03:39,429
requests ok male image in the mail spike

01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:41,949
not being on the multi rbl checker that

01:03:39,429 --> 01:03:44,439
you use which is anti-abuse double

01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:48,449
anti-abuse org there are numerous some

01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:53,859
of the multi rbl checkers out there and

01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:56,949
yes ma'am spike is actually not a bad

01:03:53,859 --> 01:04:00,069
list I've recently started using that in

01:03:56,949 --> 01:04:01,119
my post screen at a low priority low

01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,740
priority

01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:07,509
there's some isps up there using as a

01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:10,089
one hit kill oh they are not that's

01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:12,910
something i want to mention to some of

01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:15,999
you might be interested in i got my head

01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:19,470
my web address on that first page up

01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:23,499
there I don't know how to get back to it

01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:29,019
I have my post screen configuration up

01:04:23,499 --> 01:04:33,249
there at Rob 0 no dns for a slant post

01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:35,049
screen and that's my current active post

01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:37,029
screen configuration which which i'm

01:04:35,049 --> 01:04:41,650
using to block the spam some of you

01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:47,220
might find that of interest anything

01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:54,269
else i thank you all for coming i hope i

01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:54,269
didn't bore you too badly and we're done

01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:04,839
most enterprises today realize that

01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,489
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:08,859
enough to keep their network seen from

01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:10,930
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:05:08,859 --> 01:05:13,390
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:15,339
popular lately but adds that extra layer

01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:17,980
of protection enterprise networks need

01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:19,839
to stay safe but what you may not know

01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,180
is that some two-factor authentication

01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:24,369
solutions they're better than others

01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:26,030
like to factor strong authentication

01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,040
with

01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:30,920
wicked goes beyond other authentication

01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:33,470
systems by being less expensive easier

01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,900
to implement and easier to use giving

01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:37,970
software-based token clients built to

01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:41,390
run on all major devices and OSS

01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:44,030
including iOS and Android these tokens

01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:46,610
utilize a public/private key combination

01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:48,590
that's generated on device so there

01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:51,140
aren't any shared secrets flying around

01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:54,080
or attackers to hijack or which require

01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:56,150
any special handling instead all keys

01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,610
are kept secure and private between the

01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:00,800
requesting token and your server which

01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:02,440
you control aim house making it the most

01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:05,090
secure way possible to perform

pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:59,360
happening in open source the

01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:01,160
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,260
of the community and the speed at which

01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,270
these are these you know these these

01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,580
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:10,160
discovered and then fixed is it like

01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:12,890
that really shows the power of the you

01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,510
know of the open source community it is

01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:18,710
global and it's definitely because of

01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:25,040
the users community people are extremely

01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:26,960
friendly and almost ready to help if you

01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:29,240
go on tire see any day you'll see these

01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,940
guys helping each other out and they're

01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:33,650
all doing it like in a selfless manner

01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:36,640
the product is transparent for everyone

01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:39,590
everyone can look at the code base

01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,300
everyone can see how close darkest is

01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:47,180
being built nothing nothing is

01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:49,820
proprietary everything is open in many

01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:54,020
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:57,800
unborn health CloudStack the most

01:07:54,020 --> 01:08:01,680
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:04,349
was our first developer boot camp

01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,990
and our call gave people a gave me two

01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:10,950
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:15,119
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:17,969
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,489
chairs in the room twice everything

01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:23,759
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:26,819
is open source and so I don't think that

01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,560
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:31,589
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,319
computing and so i think it's i think

01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:35,670
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,779
about cloud computing you're really

01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:42,330
talking about open source cloud

01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:45,480
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:47,880
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:51,810
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:54,449
each data centers these hardware is

01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:57,929
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:08:54,449 --> 01:09:00,660
to handle number one that mass scale

01:08:57,929 --> 01:09:03,810
number two it's designed to handle the

01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:06,690
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:09,299
deployments started working on contact

01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:12,569
over four years ago

01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:15,000
it was the original set of people

01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:17,219
working on it had a background of

01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,029
delivering software telcos and service

01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:25,409
providers lots of QA lots of users

01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:28,529
actually using it high availability is

01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:32,130
the key feature multiple hypervisors

01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:34,529
support different network models we can

01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:36,569
pick up whatever suits you better well

01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:40,500
step management server can be deployed

01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:42,299
in different physical machines it

01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,920
definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:49,349
being deployed everywhere there's a

01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:51,109
major movie studio that they were using

01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:54,270
cloudstack they were using it to

01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:56,460
transmit video and I thought that was

01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,750
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:01,020
fascinating is what they did during

01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:03,809
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,190
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:07,110
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:11,250
the instances and get back to doing real

01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:12,570
work cloudstack is vast it touches so

01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,670
many different aspects and there's no

01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:17,040
one person that's kind of like a master

01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:21,119
of all those realms I think CloudStack

01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:23,369
as a project is going to be one of the

01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:27,420
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:32,849
most feature fallen and and robust

01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:35,780
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:10:32,849 --> 01:10:35,780
living through the clouds dag

01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:26,130
your customers rely on your website or

01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,500
application if it's slower

01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:31,440
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,270
and costs you money keeping your

01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,770
business critical systems humming along

01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:39,620
requires insight into what they're doing

01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:41,600
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:44,090
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,010
resource limitations and other problems

01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,930
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:50,540
your systems performance metrics in

01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:53,390
real-time and record this data for later

01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:55,370
analysis enter longview the new way to

01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:57,410
see what's really going on under the

01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:59,510
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,520
visualize the status of all your systems

01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:04,250
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:07,370
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:09,830
memory swap processes load and network

01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:12,410
usage click a specific system to access

01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:14,390
its individual dashboard then click and

01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:17,390
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:19,400
more detail comprehensive network data

01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:22,100
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,660
is available on the network tab and disk

01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,580
rights and free space on the disk

01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:28,430
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:30,950
displays usage statistics for individual

01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:33,140
processes the system info tab shows

01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:35,390
listening services active connections

01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,520
and available updates adding long view

01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:39,200
to a system is easy just click the

01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,360
button copy the one line installation

01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,790
command then run the command on your

01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,500
linux system to complete the process the

01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:47,660
agent will begin collecting data and

01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,489
sending it to longview then the graph

01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:52,099
start rolling

01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:54,469
use longview to gain visibility into

01:12:52,099 --> 01:12:58,210
your servers so when your website or app

01:12:54,469 --> 01:12:58,210
heats up it stays up

01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,790
Oh

01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,960
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:20,910
ago we could not have imagined that

01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,100
asterisk would not only become the most

01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:25,260
widely adopted open source communication

01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:27,300
software on the planet but that it would

01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,820
impact the entire industry in the way

01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,800
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,410
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,390
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,490
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:39,870
transition of power from the hands of

01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:42,150
the traditional proprietary phone

01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:44,550
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:46,470
administrators of phone systems using

01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,700
this power our customers have created

01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:49,650
all sorts of business changing

01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:51,510
applications from small office phone

01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:54,000
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,620
the international carrier networks in

01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,420
fact there's even an entire country

01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:00,000
those communications infrastructure runs

01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:01,920
on esters the gym has always been about

01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,630
creating technology that expands

01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,820
communications capabilities in ways that

01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:07,020
we could never have imagined and that's

01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:09,390
part of what's game-changing about

01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:12,090
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:14,190
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:16,320
IP phones that extends control of the

01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:18,060
user all the way to the desktop the

01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,770
launch of these new products represents

01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,870
the next phase indigenous history of

01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:24,270
innovation these are the first and only

01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:25,620
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:27,270
power of esther's when we first

01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,950
discussed our expectations for building

01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:31,560
a family of phones for use with asterisk

01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:33,330
our requirements were pretty simple we

01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,100
asked the team to build the phones such

01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:37,290
that they were easy to install integrate

01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,150
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:41,700
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:43,350
that goal user feedback is validating

01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,450
that when it comes to operation with

01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:47,880
asher space systems including our own

01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:50,460
Switchvox based product these are the

01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,750
easiest to use best integrated most

01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,360
interoperable products on the market

01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:56,340
today the Digium family of phones will

01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,410
initially include three IP desk phones

01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:00,330
uniquely designed to complement any

01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:02,220
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:04,860
these phones are different for a number

01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:07,530
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:08,940
designed for use with esters secondly

01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:10,580
we've made it really easy to

01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,960
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,640
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,350
to access information inside of

01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,010
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:20,590
between an application and the

01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:22,719
phone additionally we've created an

01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:24,849
applications engine that allows users

01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:28,090
and developers to create and run their

01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:29,860
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,809
done all of this at a very compelling

01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:33,489
price point at digium we're always

01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:35,590
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:38,110
the best value in business phone systems

01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:39,699
and also give them the power to create

01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:41,860
their own solutions or any

01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:43,570
communications challenge will continue

01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,010
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:47,079
Astra's cooler faster and more

01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,699
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:51,159
asterisk and what communications even

01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:54,869
easier and together we'll change the way

01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:54,869
