the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

more information about the southeast

linux fest visit WWDC linux fest over

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,810
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,689
2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,689
possible

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
hi

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,830
all of you

00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,830
Oh

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:13,630
why did you come in early so we're going

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,630
to skip almost

00:02:43,099 --> 00:03:06,720
this is not a lesson or not going to go

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:11,489
you guys there other than it here compaq

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,500
enter goodness concepts like i said

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:16,040
earlier we're gonna be posting it says

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,040
hi

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,310
so the world magazine

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,250
why

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:16,880
and his introduction

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:20,690
later and do more research done an

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:27,410
all-state that's fine this presentation

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:29,090
is hosted on our website electrical and

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,760
hopefully we'll be able to bring up

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,640
ground that you can do your own addition

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,440
studying it won't seem like 3d I also

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,960
the big confidence personal happiness a

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,030
thing for people that understand teacher

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,250
feels their way up here and I was right

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,040
right here trying i was trying to bridge

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,790
that gap so my goal today is to make it

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,250
easier for you to bridge that gap so

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,160
we'll start with a simple question what

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,890
is a teenager and we're answering this

00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,800
question and break this phrase seem to

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,130
jail capitals respective parts

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,130
tournament route and linux hopefully you

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,500
guys this the entire file system is in

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:16,070
one big dirty and ruben the dress really

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,810
is the pleasure of the suspect is in

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,400
contrast to windows or something else

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:25,479
where you have to strategy to see

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:28,130
gravity tractors bro so we saying chroot

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,860
we're actually talking about is we're

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:34,070
going to change what the process sees

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,410
has the roof assistant so you log into

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,750
assistant you're browsing around your

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,790
sight to see

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,110
/ bar graph you'll see the / I've seen

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,180
your homework all those things you

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,820
expect to see them when you're changing

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,620
the root of the process then odds are

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,830
you won't see those things will be

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,050
basically you're moving up the tree and

00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,560
that's your new home that's all your

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,510
processability the jail course of this

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,700
is that we're going to restrict what is

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,880
inside the seizure all that was

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:11,450
necessary to process those with meaning

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,130
I don't need 90 thousand five areas of

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,450
lessons for jail I'm not going to carry

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,880
not going to carry on lunch of extra

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,790
conversion I'm not going to copy the

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,730
entire project supply at choc chip

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,310
there's not much point there's a lot of

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,050
extraneous information and part of the

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,000
reason why do this because you want to

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,470
restrict information is visible to this

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,630
service to process what happened so

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,510
putting all those things together we

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,060
understand the future trade changing the

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,479
rivet ah system for what one process

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,860
Louisa could see and researching to only

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,099
plus necessary

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:58,080
process to do this work that's what

00:06:53,099 --> 00:07:02,060
seems now once they can buy secure

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,259
self-contained apartment so it isn't you

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,240
everything that is required do your job

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,150
you have to be very narrow and designed

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,580
it so i will use your logic to assistant

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,169
and you use to access to work with one

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,449
website let's say you're hosting 10

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,759
websites and system the only needs

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,009
access to one so you can build a jail

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,169
and give them access to just the one

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:26,129
side adjust the tools you'll need to

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:29,129
work if you know this users or demand

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:32,240
model that you know we just execs it's

00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,500
about access to pop this requires

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,699
knowing exactly what that use your

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:43,349
process whereas jail knowing exactly

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:47,659
what is going to eat it provides

00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:51,930
isolation between different Russell so

00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:55,319
when you see true something you are

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,680
blocking it off what that processes I

00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,759
think else I system yeah what precedes

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,849
you feels they will not know the

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,830
existence of each other so building its

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:11,129
own little a prophecy to jail but all

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,889
required functionality insanity

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:16,010
everything you need and that's where

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,210
some of the study

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,550
you haven't really known your tools

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,410
intimately to understand all the things

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:28,530
in these and sometimes you can get

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:30,420
really really funny what interesting

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,669
construction skills that can be built

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,120
for almost any reason today we're gonna

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:41,240
person pretty typical uses but there's

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:44,159
some pretty awesome stuff the entire

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,310
subsystems all your servers or other

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,470
services and farmers out whatever you're

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,740
thinking so all some examples of where

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,830
these would be used like the bill change

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,080
for 12 most every major distribution

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:01,230
want to start building their packages on

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,600
to say now whatever I have running

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,290
eyelashes I want to go to a clean

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,240
environment to compile this tool okay to

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:15,330
that so I'm going to build a CDS group

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,010
and serum into that environment and use

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,750
it to go back up there for whatever

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,610
changes I made to my system whatever

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,540
customizations I look at the conversion

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,130
of whoopsie la grosse messages you want

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,260
to make sure that the changes you made

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:32,160
your just don't contaminate the packages

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,850
you're making you do this Jim I have a

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,550
service I

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,970
something that the engineers work is too

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:43,040
and I have none of this to us I want to

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,390
make sure that I could give engineers

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,680
what they need to do their job without

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:52,970
license systems so I set up the siege of

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,780
jail for this surface or this actually

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,130
happened years ago then we had a 200 I

00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:02,750
understand why we made this choice they

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:06,140
wanted a graph 54 but they wanted a

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,550
grantee Lucy from South customs there

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,240
was the only way to get this one to work

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,520
it drove me mad either I had to go an

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,410
entire system for his 12 or add it to

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,870
the center stage of jail so you could

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,270
coexist with everything else so I set up

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,570
a siege from jail this one is service is

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:27,080
one tool we can have our libraries into

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:33,440
a special whatever and can happen

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:39,380
closest to the Sun system why are say

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,000
two choices well if your system gets

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,590
compromised

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,990
hosting you can provide that compromise

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:54,440
from judging universes tradition a think

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,030
of a website you're servicing web users

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,080
and you've got dynamic application

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:03,010
custom forms on your page and someone

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,830
figured out how to take you over lunch

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:09,350
so to prevent them from accessing the

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,690
rest of your system you can't set up

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,350
your web server to the inside gym and

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:19,010
then so let's say they did break the

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:22,220
rules so I a jacket well that's one

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:28,940
service and that's limiting the damage

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:31,730
to the other 14 sources yeah also this

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,680
is called principal least privilege

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,950
we're trying to give the web service

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:41,810
just like these do this job anymore and

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:43,670
prevent it from having access to this is

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:48,650
this one principle is a guy on it

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:50,780
washing my blog it is behind c 3 it's

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,420
one of the reasons why you're never

00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:57,280
satisfied with just gotta keep working

00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:02,480
till you get as good a system as you

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:04,400
will see some examples of that we need

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,760
to maintain local distinctive browns to

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,700
look like i'll stop earlier is going to

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,970
their driver needed them to coexist on

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,620
the same so you also see this for

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,420
example if you guys have to use a

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,640
virtual barber cut back on our RV

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,710
animals the same kind of concept your

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,220
temporary building a small environment

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,940
like a virtual private actually you're

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,430
activating an extra crafting moment for

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,750
Michelle and you're able to work with in

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:37,140
just this little set of binary

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,930
japanese we've got the same time same

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,140
time here we're building distinct

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,120
environments for different tools and

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:50,070
sure they will stay separate and don't

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:55,560
clash again my first thing case software

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:58,770
parts of the collector you can not to

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,200
move services often at home do that's

00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:04,920
been pretty common in the last five six

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,160
years into the jonathan cahn problem is

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,710
that you're spending a lot of extra

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,400
resources on something you need i need

00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:16,710
if i want to i sent five years i can put

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,080
it in central jail during the video of

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,900
gold worth just thought you put it on

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,060
Phil via now you've got an entire system

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,650
turning subsystems and everything else

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,570
that wants to do that's going to be

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:32,550
taking resources away from everything

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:34,680
else so now if you have a full vm

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:44,750
solution if there is nothing

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:48,330
yeah but the cost comparisons mankind

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:53,070
Lynch it is most common reason for using

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:57,420
a seat retails for students canonically

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,310
the domain name server it has issues

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,399
with it so people who is very easy to

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,270
see treated and so to go home mortgage

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,540
documentation private you'll see

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:13,020
documentation in 2000 2003 on how to see

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,760
through lot because it has some issues

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:19,080
the same thing to send mails and they

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,180
all had a terrible shock so people will

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,070
say we've gotta figure out some way the

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,890
next time so no gets compromised we can

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:32,390
prevent it's all pay the rest o system

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:35,010
you control your own risk miss them

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:39,959
because you're deciding that goes into

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:42,900
the seat retail you're deciding what to

00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,500
jail and how to do you're deciding how

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,690
the Commission should be set feel far

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:53,130
far more control and all we're just

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,690
install the system the protective

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,240
service is in the system for each other

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,060
so what happens if you have a web server

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,380
and database with one could compromise

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,720
we don't want the other one to come

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,100
it's personal yes yes it's pretty common

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,660
products and say I break into a web

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,250
application sometime I'm going to try to

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,490
escalate privileges it's like we're me I

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:20,110
can t delete our system into the system

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:23,590
so you see seater deals you can put the

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,870
devastation to matter instead it's the

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,290
best practices we were talking to her

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,560
about building a caduceus now you want

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,080
to set aside individual c troop so that

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,480
your specific change their systems don't

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,640
lead over get back this actually

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,730
happened a long time i was building

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:46,930
slacker back disturbance and i had

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,550
upgraded some happens and it was not the

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,790
upgrade was not president normal

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:54,850
distribution so here was written out of

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,760
mr. uploaded the package necessary did

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,850
work what's going on how'd it go it took

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,660
about an hour after all right thing this

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:07,120
tool the server doesn't happen so i'm an

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,800
assumption by building just on my system

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,990
that these all the things that are on my

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:17,470
system also because of the server that's

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:18,880
not an accurate assumption so it's too

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,750
good practice since it's the best

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,990
practices if you need to build Caroline

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:30,060
you can host lots of different tools all

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:32,380
the same system all relative securities

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,810
and you don't worry about one leaking

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:40,060
over to them as they literally have

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:44,710
their own the world now let's get into

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:47,110
some of the country how do I cream well

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,450
the very first thing you do you need to

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,560
understand exactly what I process these

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,800
house structure you understand how to

00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:00,420
progress the system so i'm going to

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,420
break away here should an example

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,830
you guys serious ever

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
so

00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,510
someone remember this for 30 30

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,520
then we go okay so now our this is a

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,830
blank ubuntu is well established set up

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,770
about their new support presentation no

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,660
change so we're in coming we're gonna go

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,610
around we're going to take assistant

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:21,950
here i will show you some of the tools

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:25,360
concepts so first thing is relativism

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,360
let's just go look at

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:46,230
this is a very simple you guys are able

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:48,240
to think of if I want to know a secret

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,080
trail since the deed you could run this

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,960
one too this would be relatively sure

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,250
there's no requirement it's got one

00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:06,529
library of these two and be very abusive

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:06,529
do so in contrast post

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:37,030
I did a self that's been so here we're

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:42,610
going up to higher number also post its

00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:45,490
ass requires wired set of configuration

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,440
files and those things it's going to

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:52,600
need you want access and it's going to

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,140
need some device is so we need to

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,460
understand every single cloud tool needs

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:03,309
to do its job what our man carb adoption

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,320
where they are respected because when

00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,170
you come out to Dar you're telling your

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:12,460
default place for your integration off

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:15,510
if you don't specify an option see

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,510
posting to tell us

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,120
all possible configurations all those

00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,630
tiles if you don't specify and makes

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,980
assumption that assumption is our hot

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,420
those are things again those are things

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,910
you need to understand about the system

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,700
one of these things are hardly seems to

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,230
be altered if I'm moving them around if

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,900
you are building an entirely and

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,370
environment if I'm moving around how

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,530
about to learn that I change the

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,980
location is configured I don't tell me

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:58,490
the location of device all these things

00:20:51,980 --> 00:21:00,440
that is expected really have to know so

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:07,670
we're going to start small the second

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:10,520
session or so very very you have to

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:14,120
build packing around your say to each

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,150
other so and this content they can go

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,610
anywhere we can get into semantics

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:23,330
arguments over winter it's going to go

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:28,730
to slash bar or / oft or we are you the

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:31,210
ins and outs of my standard file society

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,640
honestly it doesn't really matter there

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:37,180
wherever you want I have seen treated

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,110
users in their home directory

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:47,010
and others have seizure and services in

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,010
/ bars they're not really matter now

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,220
this part gets the logistic say they're

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:58,180
copying the processes ticket of your

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,220
seizure let's go back to or closely the

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,530
established capacity suit you do we now

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,200
have to duplicate everything that the

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,030
post Knicks would expect in a normal

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,760
system you have to do to keep the exact

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,730
same thing into your C to jail so our

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,190
example the postings is looking for / 10

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:18,190
/ 0 now you have to breathe the same

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,490
device top exact identical stop at 72

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:25,480
jail so this example here is / at / do

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:28,000
such tales or agenda so every single

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,980
item in this van boy this is where the

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,900
first step comes into play if you don't

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,780
understand your processes needs

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,210
structure for that leaves you won't be

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,830
able to the third step and it's actually

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,150
somewhat iterative process and go

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,910
through they'll get auto parts if you

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,220
you think you got it you like to try oh

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,100
this doesn't work let's do they do what

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,020
is it okay so then you go back and

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,230
pinball between step one step three step

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,970
by step 32 the thing actually and it

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,820
could be very frustrating one back and

00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:02,570
forth

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:02,570
20 hours usually over stylistic updated

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,279
now last up here is after you understood

00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,049
everything about the prophecy get all

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,510
the pieces in place now I'm going to

00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,640
tell restarting scripture process I'm

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,740
making an assumption here before HTTP

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,169
service now I have to tell the startup

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,520
script to see through this is actually

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:23,240
no to the museum depending on your

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,669
distribution in a bunch and there's the

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,440
start/stop daemon tool i think there's

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,440
natural scenery in there

00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:53,809
we go very very nice you just give this

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,769
one option starts talking BAM taste

00:23:53,809 --> 00:24:00,559
everything you're talking something like

00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:03,980
slacker so now you have to go to the

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:16,129
doctor action drama commands to see in

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:18,200
jeru to this location so you have to

00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:22,609
understand your startup script for the

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,109
service you have to understand making

00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,720
sure you've got all the pieces you need

00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:29,539
for your future and all to yourselves go

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,769
to the county now sometimes it's easy

00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:34,999
sometimes that's not let's for example

00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:38,629
those days I know why I'm picking on us

00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:40,309
so much let's just go through and look

00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,499
at all the paths all the different

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:47,330
things that supplier oh look there's the

00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:51,649
default style i'm extremely stuff and

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:54,100
it's expecting pit files our own

00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:56,840
directories that you have to update that

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,090
it's expecting a few files in certain

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,669
places look visits it's checking for

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,499
huge records right here in the middle

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,600
all this stuff is going out to alter

00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:12,350
your seat your jail again this goes back

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:14,989
under center to yes so and actually i

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,450
don't think the milk rockets fic truths

00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:19,049
so that could be problematic I would

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,320
have time

00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:26,070
beside i really need that don't pick it

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,720
out it involves now your new territory

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,419
not have to be able to reduce dash to

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,580
understand exactly why it's doing what

00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:35,549
parts can go of course instead this is

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,710
why she can't get very good because

00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:40,019
altering all these things here we have

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,429
to be perfectly all the past you can

00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,399
just go through and grab a single pass

00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:46,169
and you were the devil cry yourself to

00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,499
sleep I can't relax don't worry because

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:52,379
there's so many things in here that

00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:56,869
implements yep can we write this attack

00:25:52,379 --> 00:26:00,149
let's just look go it down so all these

00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:01,379
calls here those come off those won't be

00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:03,929
every single one of those you have to

00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:06,269
set up so it's calling to binary another

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,159
seizure oh I forgot to mention those

00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,049
sticks by itself isn't doable those

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,269
states that's a ton of little sub by

00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:14,909
national all those have to be teachers

00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:22,830
use all the apartments of those tools

00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:28,769
empty so this also so step forward in

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:32,519
the as far as steps one I run to the

00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:35,039
situation and even we're gonna stay all

00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,820
day and you're to the point now where it

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,759
works kind of you just

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,889
start the script off and go home and you

00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:46,269
spent over two hours tear your hair out

00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:48,250
because your starts completely that it's

00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:50,909
unfortunate it's what you're accepted

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:55,409
when you going to decide to change it

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:57,309
that's just so now let's go through some

00:26:55,409 --> 00:27:00,000
concepts enough to understand a little

00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:03,700
better but all's required willis

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,710
resource so let's compare suture

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:12,070
jails to berkeley this is from jail

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,409
you're still using the same resources on

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:18,309
the system the same process that leads

00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:22,000
the same current on the same every which

00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:27,190
are not sharing so help you stack the

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,450
shareholder system you can begin to

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:34,679
Colonel just away all that estate saw

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:38,590
systems so inside the siege of jail

00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:41,860
there whatever you put in at CC programs

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,450
that are outside of the sea to do can

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,860
have commissions to looking

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:52,870
sort of easy ways to manage this whole

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:55,179
figuration successor so you have to

00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,279
understand some resources of shares or

00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,690
not if you have a process of your seats

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,169
room that needs to communicate with

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,269
another tool let's say for example PHP

00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:08,200
into it by single that's a pretty common

00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:11,549
I want to see truth PHP process because

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,799
my predator really doesn't do a good job

00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:18,990
on a show his toes for JavaScript

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:22,600
assistant this is happening well the

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:25,120
traditional wedding communicated sequel

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:29,169
juice through Osaka to talk the same

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,880
system if you're doing it that way my

00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:35,440
sequel socket has to be he's at the

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,460
scene to share the my sequel binary make

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,760
an assumption of where does your

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,580
judgment public do I want driving sequel

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,019
door go on just tell the binary I on the

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,700
side over here this location you can

00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:50,529
skip all that though because you can

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,070
also contact messaging through a network

00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:56,380
tcp side that's far easier so if you

00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,539
need to share resources inside outside

00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:03,820
of jail nine times out of ten yourself

00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:07,790
it's the easiest way to dinner

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:13,390
can you suckers of them for this little

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,390
boy watch this article views just

00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:21,200
understanding stagnant linked by days

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,060
when we're seeing through jailing the

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,580
process we need to know about showing

00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,120
earlier you have to know every single

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,160
library the binary nice job and every

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,890
single those libraries to go inside and

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,200
see true so when you stand at the bottom

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,380
and are you representing put all the

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,170
contents of those levers that into the

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,060
batter yourself just to clarify when I

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,790
say that the word right are you going in

00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:51,340
there twice people it's all just be

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:55,250
quick your ticket seven and five

00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:58,340
financial com you can set them up to do

00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:00,440
that with your side Paula yourself saves

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,960
you a lot of effort in a legacy to jail

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,090
but odds are now you're maintaining two

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,450
different sets of tools so you are still

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,950
enough loot to use dynamically linked to

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,280
loose and you can literally just not be

00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:15,020
a cherry pick items out of your system

00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,470
but how you're going to maintain the

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:21,560
fleet of libraries so it's take your

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,540
point at which what you want I normally

00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,370
go for the second for just cherry

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,980
together

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:32,980
that means I just enough to collaborate

00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:36,600
okay then pull that updated that's just

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,600
my personal choice you make sure you set

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:44,860
permissions users big okay i want to get

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,360
around in cotati seeds will see the

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:51,670
example this is the second session sshs

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,010
are you thinking about its users groups

00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:58,300
of commissions so we building the chroot

00:30:54,010 --> 00:31:02,290
user very very careful you can spend a

00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,300
very long time very well built security

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:08,620
all the way goes out the window because

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:11,590
that relationship you get the goals to

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,450
my information from the user and such

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,880
commissioners and make sure users and

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:20,200
groups are safer if the goal is to allow

00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:24,490
multiple users situation I origin we see

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,490
into the web server and the Cyclops for

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,770
a 27 the users that want to work with

00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:34,510
the site stoned indirect himself feel

00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:36,760
today downloading content writers so the

00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,290
may have ascended up such that there was

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,880
a group inside the stage we chilled

00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,790
national girls outside the state

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,309
regional and everybody was happy to go

00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:49,410
talk to you this can get really cold

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,410
case i could probably

00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:57,020
this is one of the things to do while we

00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:59,180
got there I'll handle this is an

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,420
important concept for a specific sub

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:07,040
class c treated when you have a tool

00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:09,320
that understands that is game selection

00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,480
options to do so it will look at that

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,240
mess that confession there's an

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:18,080
important concept here when i started

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,710
program i need to open a file to read

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,930
the constant i need to over the flouse

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:27,770
what I have some direct law concepts

00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:30,620
like the great turnout if this program

00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:33,800
that I'm writing are working with is CG

00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,960
alert and it's well built it will

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,200
actually look at all those five hands up

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,180
early on its process and leave them open

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,550
and then you see you extrude into the

00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,560
place we're supposed to go because those

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:49,940
files are our deal and dissolving

00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:52,850
program they don't need the images so if

00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:56,480
you're writing to if you expect to be

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,010
jail and you're trying to figure out how

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,070
to make it easy to be easy to go just

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:03,140
open up your file handles ahead open up

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,350
our learning process so you can do some

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,850
really cool stuff with this those sticks

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,890
has a built-in like that stay true

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:16,460
detectives Elvis

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:17,930
a lot of tools php-fpm as we do this is

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,510
what it does is open to all the fall

00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,640
hands and needs earlier on process all

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,130
the sockets are expected to be there it

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,920
opens of all then slides down the jail

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,200
she opens actively and saves a lot of

00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,730
time that only works if you're using a

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,730
permanent or standing straight seizure

00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,840
but also look at examples of

00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,270
interactions other Park Assist did

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,010
discuss this somewhere tasty piece I've

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:48,440
purchased intersect just the general is

00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,420
if whatever your seat really needs to

00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,910
talk outside of its needs group is

00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,210
connect using it so if you're riding it

00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:59,000
to expect any be some networking just

00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:04,670
factor that in the air crazy i'll let

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,410
you have to take so let's look at some

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,590
of the tools with one unit of those

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:14,320
features i was just briefly showing you

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:19,040
building two displays all the libraries

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,929
expected see now if you believe this and

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,240
believe it as catalog everything

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,740
displays is it you're going to have that

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,810
because there are switches where

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,980
something is not linked explicitly a

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:35,159
spider and

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,889
seagulls will see in general down the

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:42,859
second session where LD completely

00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:42,859
forgets to misinformation that prevents

00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:49,429
so let's go look at go over some alcohol

00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,429
DD

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:06,910
little loosen it back flap Johnny

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:36,160
Oh looks like okay

00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:50,420
well plan B all right so we have to go

00:35:50,780 --> 00:36:04,010
full screen you can get me out in the

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,010
slave left in the trash okay good switch

00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:15,990
give me smalls okay well at least it's

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:20,430
real easy to use less inertia oh ok it

00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:27,870
is wrong with this now isolated alright

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:30,810
so so we were looking for school it'll

00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,990
only be showing it all library set a

00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:37,230
binary perspective let's look at what a

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,430
little more interest bash it sacramental

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:43,490
procedure eating if you're building

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,490
these are all rounds that's not so bad

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,590
now i'm not going to go into exactly

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,599
what all these different letters that is

00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:57,029
a long round of trailing that we

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:59,009
really must know that Bobby's I will

00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:01,109
Homer discussed something that's

00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:04,049
important for all these user kills

00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:06,359
becomes elaborate the major and minor

00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:11,130
version number of mud let's pick on us

00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:13,410
then team to library the daiso extension

00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,809
gate stationary object of course library

00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:20,059
and then it can have one more numbers

00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:20,059
after eyes look at that

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:37,250
so we're seeing here in order to

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:40,530
simplify this a library can have major

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:47,220
release numbers I can go over deep with

00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:49,050
that but for simplicity sake there are

00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,650
they similar so we have the actual

00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:57,060
library ActionAid sff finance major by

00:37:52,650 --> 00:38:01,350
aberdeen oh well bourbon 5 of 9 and

00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:03,210
verse 58 35-7 should all have the same

00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,520
exact functionality our differences over

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:08,640
the date of my blog press releases on

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,110
top of seven so we really like hear

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,020
about us that this range original

00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,940
thought so they have Adamson like here

00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,550
so something is looking for I need major

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,560
version 5 of this library they've got

00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,910
the simply here to support and you're

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,890
building your co trips and you're

00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,180
copying in libraries be carefully and

00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:29,450
don't be talking in a bunch of empty

00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,450
symbols they go nowhere so just

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,080
thank you

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:53,440
ok so I'm going to pretend I Catholics

00:38:46,450 --> 00:39:04,440
teacher so this library is resident and

00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:04,440
this before we go backward

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,250
so specific

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:26,510
alright so i created inside this farce

00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:30,280
much more stuff situated i'm starting to

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:42,290
build my future want to confidently

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:44,690
that's great it worked actually did do

00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,550
not giving in the dash next time most

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:48,200
holy guy should he does it anyway then

00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,180
what was supposed to happen in this

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,760
example it was only supposed to conquer

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:56,720
the simple I've actually had this

00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:07,580
problem before it was regulated by my

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:10,790
library oh so maybe this is a are you

00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:15,020
sure yes I was building 110 04 and was

00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:20,330
not doing that is it always on it I have

00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:22,100
a crack system okay well that's great

00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,270
just make sure when your company's

00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:31,190
everything you're not talking just

00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:38,359
endless make sure actually looking at

00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:41,470
how do I get out left no well we're

00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,470
trapped in here let's get going

00:40:49,650 --> 00:41:04,000
we got jailed ourselves nvm left oh look

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:08,670
at that very small okay so what was the

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,950
next one deniability that's Tracy right

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:16,630
that's Tracy there is powerful during

00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:18,760
wordy tool you cannot figure out why

00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,480
something is not working you go to

00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:28,000
district and I have sworn just very

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:36,990
simply too many a time i'm working with

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,990
using SJC the girls so let's dive in

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,070
here we go less through your hottest

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:58,100
whispers there's two major ways in these

00:41:52,070 --> 00:42:01,880
districts one of them one of them is to

00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:07,760
see what a existing burger is it our

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:12,710
death so I system right here this is

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:21,050
inside our CBS HD fine let's go astray

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:26,270
stuff right now it's doing nine its best

00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:30,710
it right this but let's do something a

00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:35,930
little more whoopsie we have to check

00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:39,650
that out I've gotta know Lucy to nothing

00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:49,660
the whole or nothing honest let's do

00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:49,660
this let's um i'ma do

00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:12,539
pretty little scripts doing something

00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:16,309
over here oh I'm using tools green you

00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:21,409
come to my session some day I wake up

00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:21,409
let's go look at one of these

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,150
nice good

00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:42,550
don't think 1833 there we go now we're

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,600
seeing this is lives the system calls it

00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:56,860
a little script I wrote the story you

00:43:46,600 --> 00:44:02,860
can see hairs all right so it's waiting

00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:04,330
for a while then it's writing to get an

00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,180
assistant called a great ability

00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,400
territories 10 exactly the right place

00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,860
doing it with man page just give you

00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,810
click over right the first time in here

00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,820
is the file handle what's right into it

00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:21,670
like other than what is it writing to

00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:23,950
there are those this returning to buy a

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:28,390
couch Daniel is a grid so here we're

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:31,060
seeing is riding 47 months to all I want

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,160
to say it out we're just doing some

00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:39,430
stuff I don't care about a lot expecting

00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:41,170
a whole lot of stuff I don't know okay

00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:44,950
sleep is prima doing a lot of little

00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:47,260
justly so when you're using estrace I

00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,910
said it's very wordy you're going to

00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,610
have far more information than you

00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:55,060
actually it's going to be a tool or a

00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:58,560
task to filter out mine is actually so

00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,560
the air or bunch of extra stuff

00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,790
go look it up it's not necessarily to

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,800
entice looking for certain key things

00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:11,880
for Reed sister all rights this cross

00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,880
opens stats

00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:24,519
trudel constantly song

00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,900
you

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,000
Lulu

00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:49,190
it's a whole lot of a deal if I have

00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:53,089
services on here actually my actual tax

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:55,640
land on the web server just try as

00:45:53,089 --> 00:46:01,070
tracing you overprocess one time this

00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:04,670
class professor you go good idea so

00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:16,430
that's one way mysteries another way is

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:18,859
to start to the side very terribly but

00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:24,520
it's telling us all the system calls it

00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:28,640
is me part of the problem here is

00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,990
Estrella screaming to standard here you

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,210
guys are familiar with drops off very

00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:36,829
much standard apps in there are two

00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:43,000
different output file and because it's a

00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:46,490
good one foot so pay normal senses to

00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,800
bring very stylish spring all this

00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:51,440
information is take it out meanwhile

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,810
fire on pinterest race almost extra

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,750
information here they refuse to get

00:46:53,810 --> 00:47:00,530
there so it's really the screen is too

00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:08,820
small to spline by too fast

00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:16,470
let's do this I'm now going to dump the

00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:19,080
contents of this race for the Occupy now

00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:22,740
tools offering right now in the

00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:26,880
background my ass racing captured to

00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:30,620
this final build now I can go unleash

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,050
your review all the things that used to

00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:37,650
it starts the very top and exactly as we

00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:40,230
certainly program is the very soft brown

00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:42,660
reason is called way she done

00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:45,720
programming is officially these the

00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:48,540
premise that that's your maple all the

00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,440
things is doing here so it's very chakra

00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:56,430
see this el viernes o that leads to be

00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,710
cap lobbies up front here are looking to

00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:01,440
a proper lab we looked at painting only

00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,570
had two library but part of the process

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,480
of the program

00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:13,850
those finals I dress and that does

00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:17,030
really drunk how all that works best but

00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,890
there's so much to cover a card we're

00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:22,360
looking at the contents of this estrace

00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,360
is looking for

00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,920
see

00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:50,450
so here we see an open open this is a

00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:52,670
good letter the Psalms circling flag and

00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,170
then very next thing is that he's

00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:59,330
reading from it because it's got some

00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:02,330
Commission's then its memory mapping

00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:06,920
some portions of the biologists just

00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:15,170
opened into memory so use it later it's

00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:17,000
protecting us section right now okay

00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:22,310
here we are now going down to soccer

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,020
calls excellent networking stuff there's

00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,750
just a lot of fascination is a lot of

00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,430
useless information in here too but it's

00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,840
a lot of fast information Nick

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:35,270
administration it to leave under system

00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:37,820
as you're building your series if you've

00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:42,380
got a useful but s6 estrace the inside

00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:46,730
or CA truth sometimes we just

00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:49,310
why this thing is not working then you

00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,920
can estrace inside the sea creature

00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:55,310
estrace outside and you can compare the

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:59,420
zune see where they differ so what am I

00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:03,340
missing Wallace is detective these two

00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:03,340
tools in the main tools are using to do

00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:17,630
okay so this is the end of the first

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:19,280
thing we going online you guys have a

00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:23,320
questions think I didn't tell her I

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,320
believe oh yes

00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:39,730
is the question is if cr2 irrelevant at

00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:43,270
SMX is right I would say so this dude

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:45,130
getting work at that point you're

00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,900
building which is you're building a

00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:53,910
secret feel really gonna miss you better

00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:53,910
start extra 20 Strasse standards

00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:05,970
okay so then the equivalent for that'd

00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:10,050
be like a bomb like that y duos that's a

00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:13,050
very good question I honestly have not

00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:16,349
open to a swim is very much on my list

00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:19,470
of things to do a long time my standard

00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:22,230
experience trabecular sous chef Kristen

00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:45,030
that's it le you guys are all the same

00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:50,369
experience it's been a long work yes it

00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:52,859
is a lot that's let's talk you out of it

00:51:50,369 --> 00:52:00,650
we can help me figure out why our

00:51:52,859 --> 00:52:02,730
customers about okay so other questions

00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:07,349
comments

00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:11,950
this how do these different jails

00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:14,109
that is also a good question is do you

00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,569
understand mr. Josiah that's what I was

00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:18,609
asking well I don't know when we can

00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:22,089
look together diverse round right to the

00:52:18,609 --> 00:52:31,750
world answer this one cuz I'm curiouser

00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:35,440
I have very much okay so did you go into

00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:37,450
a little it's more than just situated

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,779
you see it sure does not discussing this

00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:43,289
little bit justifies everything is still

00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:46,359
shared constant show context associated

00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:49,750
technically a program that essentially

00:52:46,359 --> 00:53:10,140
can still reach into round and make crop

00:52:49,750 --> 00:53:10,140
all shapes the other question yes

00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:21,560
no I just so you can get in a situation

00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:23,210
where your seat return tool and someone

00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,910
has managed to get into it they're using

00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,350
alternate sources you're still going out

00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,540
so that's one of those yet to decide you

00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:35,390
have to make a choice of prop is it

00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:38,050
worth it for me to go to obviously so

00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:40,670
you can protect yourself and that's it

00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,990
that's a very good question and it's one

00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:44,000
of those decisions if you're planning a

00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:46,190
flat again you have to know it's

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,310
possible so part of the business for

00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:51,260
what is awesome and once you know it's

00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:54,860
possible to decide what is my level

00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:57,820
first of my willing to take one what do

00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:02,240
I think about most like a status and

00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:04,630
protected kiss very good girl the other

00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,630
questions

00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:16,570
I tried necessity I did a lot of

00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,570
practice or something

00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:33,130
for long and so that state entities

00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:37,690
somewhere else and then go any other

00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:38,830
questions okay we're done just a little

00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,560
bit early on the break and get some

00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:43,450
water tested it walk around I'll come

00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,099
back here in 10-15 minutes and get

00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:50,760
circle second session when you're diving

00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:50,760
and very heavy into yeah yeah it's

00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:38,790
most enterprises today realize that

00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,470
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,840
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,910
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,950
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,080
popular lately that adds that extra

00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,750
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,520
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,710
know is that some two-factor

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,930
authentication solutions they're better

00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:00,990
than others like two-factor strong

00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:03,240
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,220
beyond other authentication systems by

00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,280
being less expensive easier to implement

00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:10,740
and easier to use giving software-based

00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,590
token clients built to run on all major

00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:16,190
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:18,540
Android these tokens utilize a

00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:20,940
public/private key combination that's

00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,890
generated on device so there aren't any

00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,410
shared secrets flying around or

00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:28,260
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:30,150
special handling instead all keys are

00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,610
kept secure and private between the

00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,800
requesting token and your server which

00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,410
you control aim house making it the most

00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,090
secure way possible to perform

00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,880
authentication encryption and with an

00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:44,670
extensive flexible API and support for

00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,650
protocols like LDAP and radius wicked

00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:48,839
works with any enterprise network

two-factor authentication for the first

00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:01,950
time or just ready to ditch your

00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:04,349
existing expensive key file system we

00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:09,289
can help with easy to implement easy to

00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:09,289
use strong authentication from wicked

00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:18,040
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,260
ago we could not have imagined that

00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:22,450
asterisk would not only become the most

00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,610
widely adopted open source communication

00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:26,620
software on the planet but that it would

00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:29,140
impact the entire industry in the way

00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,120
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,760
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,710
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,840
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,220
transition of power from the hands of

00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,500
the traditional proprietary phone

00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,900
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,970
administrators of phone systems using

00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,620
this power our customers have traded all

00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,690
sorts of business changing applications

00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,490
from small office phone systems to

00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,590
mission-critical call centers the

00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:55,420
international carrier networks in fact

00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,890
there's even an entire country those

00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,140
communications infrastructure runs on

00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:01,270
esters the gym has always been about

00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,980
creating technology that expands

00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:05,170
communications capabilities in ways that

00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,370
we could never have imagined and that's

00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,740
part of what's game-changing about

00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:11,440
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,540
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,640
IP phones that extends control of the

00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,410
user all the way to the desktop the

00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,120
launch of these new products represents

00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,220
the next phase indigenous history of

00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,620
innovation these are the first and only

00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,330
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,890
power of Astra's when we first discussed

00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,930
our expectations for building a family

00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:31,060
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:32,800
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,450
the team to build the phones such that

00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,640
they were easy to install integrate

00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:38,500
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,050
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,670
that goal user feedback is validating

00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,800
that when it comes to operation with

00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,230
Astra space systems including our own

00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,810
Switchvox based product these are the

00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,100
easiest to use best integrated most

00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:53,680
interoperable products on the market

00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,690
today the digitally phones will

00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,730
initially include three IP desk phones

00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:59,680
uniquely designed to complement any

00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,540
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,210
these phones are different for a number

00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,880
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,290
designed for use with asterisks secondly

00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,930
we've made it really easy to

00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:12,310
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,990
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,700
to access information inside of

00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:17,940
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,900
between an application and the

00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:22,090
additionally we've created an

00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,190
applications engine that allows users

00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:26,800
and developers to create and run their

00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:28,870
own apps on the following and finally

00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,940
we've done all of this at a very

00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:32,620
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,390
always thinking of ways to give our

00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:36,760
customers the best value in business

00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:38,710
phone systems and also give them the

00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,780
power to create their own solutions or

00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,670
any communications challenge well

00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,350
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:46,420
to make Astra's cooler faster and more

00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:48,160
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,710
asterisk and communications even easier

00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,210
and together we'll change the way the

00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,210
world communication again

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,790
your customers rely on your website or

01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:08,160
application if it's slower

01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:11,100
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,930
and costs you money keeping your

01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:16,420
business critical systems humming along

01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:18,760
requires insight into what they're doing

01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,710
your system metrics tells stories

01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,720
stories that can reveal performance

01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:25,030
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,620
other problems but how do you keep an

01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:29,260
eye on all of your systems performance

01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:32,290
metrics in real-time and record this

01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,060
data for later analysis enter longview

01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:36,070
the new way to see what's really going

01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:38,230
on under the hood the long view

01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:40,300
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:42,730
of all your systems providing you with a

01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:46,120
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:48,700
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,470
load and network usage click a specific

01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,870
system to access its individual

01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:55,380
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:57,760
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,440
comprehensive network data including

01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,750
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,340
available on the network tab and disk

01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,230
rights and free space on the disk

01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:08,080
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:10,630
displays usage statistics for individual

01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,790
processes the system info tab shows

01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,040
listening services active connections

01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:17,170
and available updates adding long view

01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,880
to a system is easy just click the

01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:21,010
button copy the one line installation

01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,440
command then run the command on your

01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,150
linux system to complete the process the

01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,340
agent will begin collecting data and

01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:29,180
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,760
start rolling

01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:34,130
use longview to gain visibility into

01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,839
your servers so when your website or app

01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,839
heats up it stays up

01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:48,200
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:50,359
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:53,810
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:57,640
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:53,810 --> 01:02:01,160
happening in open source the

01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,960
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,060
of the community and the speed at which

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,070
these are these you know these these

01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:09,320
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:11,960
discovered and then fixed is it I think

01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:14,660
that really shows the power of the you

01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,310
know of the open source community it is

01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:20,510
global and it's definitely because of

01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:22,880
the users community people are extremely

01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:28,099
friendly and they're always ready to

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:29,599
help if you go an entire see any day

01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:31,910
you'll see these guys helping each other

01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,280
out and they're all doing it like in a

01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:36,140
selfless manner the product is

01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:39,920
transparent for everyone everyone can

01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:42,380
look at the code base everyone can see

01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,990
how close duck is is being built nothing

01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:50,089
nothing is proprietary everything is

01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:55,580
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:59,450
to the the ongoing health cloudstack the

01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:03,440
most exciting event in recent memory for

01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:06,140
me was our first developer boot camp

01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,780
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:12,740
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:16,940
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:19,760
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:22,280
chairs into the room twice everything

01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,640
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:28,609
is open source and so I don't think that

01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,349
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:33,410
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:36,109
computing and so i think it's i think

01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:37,460
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:38,569
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:44,119
talking about open source cloud

01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:47,180
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:49,310
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:53,569
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:56,240
in each data centers these hardware is

01:03:53,569 --> 01:03:59,750
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:02,450
to handle number one that mass scale

01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:05,630
number two it's designed to handle the

01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:07,880
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:10,700
deployments we started working on

01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:14,210
college attack over four years ago and

01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:16,819
it was the original set of people

01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:19,010
working on it had a background of

01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:22,819
delivering software telcos and service

01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:27,260
providers lots of QA lots of users

01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:31,270
actually using it high availability is a

01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:34,220
key feature multiple hypervisors support

01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:36,650
different network models you can pick up

01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:38,780
whatever suits you better while steck

01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:42,290
management server can be deployed in

01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:44,089
different physical machines it

01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:45,740
definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:51,140
being deployed everywhere there's a

01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:52,869
major movie studio that they were using

01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:56,060
cloudstack they were using it to

01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:58,250
transcode video and I thought that was

01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,569
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:02,839
fascinating is what they did during

01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:05,630
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:06,800
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,720
lunch was over they would just

01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:12,740
all the instances and go back to doing

01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,360
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,460
so many different aspects and there's no

01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,830
one person that's kind of like a master

01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:22,940
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:25,160
as a project is going to be one of the

01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:29,210
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:34,670
most feature follin and and robust

01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:37,570
platforms out they were I don't senior

01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,570
