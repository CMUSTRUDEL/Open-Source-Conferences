the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

more information about the southeast

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:20,160
linux fest visit WWDC linux fest or the

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,619
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,689
the following diamond sponsors in 2013

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,689
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,130
two

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,130
first year

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,600
I swear I thought

00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,749
that left

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:18,260
you wish you could use your computer

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:22,060
skills save the world never happens you

00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,060
never save life your unix

00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,009
bye

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:51,930
hopefully what is compact expressive

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,930
notation

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,840
this feels a little more right it's

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,000
Lionel's this is what most would call of

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,020
course you got I think some you do

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,810
remember those photos you have something

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,050
picked up one of the extensions garbage

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,550
across your screen in your terminal

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,550
program that's kind of

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:58,070
so 1943 news why formalized clean this

00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:03,110
up a little Matt Matt and Russ box over

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:05,739
here and find out how I describe sign

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:11,260
languages which means basically the

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:11,260
pretty cool the south

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:34,140
press the button do that area so this is

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,490
this is natural teletype this is the

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:42,330
sort of thing trailer trash all time

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:47,280
when you edit stuff and this was your in

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,290
offense a school paper you had a hard

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,430
time this one of the days of the ice

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,010
cream unity and yet they managed to do

00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,080
it quite well so in nineteen sixty

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,360
something can't top of unix and see a

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,260
new version TV they might you see

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,180
business in IBM 7090 assembler so

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,970
infected the other items that we see

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:19,739
wasn't the program in 68 in toxicology

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:22,549
regular turtle eggs again this is again

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,549
and I piano

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:33,300
this kind of music gets us to this issue

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:38,210
q te the gap head yea the a B X DX began

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:41,720
p on so these are these the tools that

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:45,420
we use we use your past several decades

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:51,830
regular eggs go all the way back very

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:54,800
beginning now let's start talking about

00:04:51,830 --> 00:05:10,970
some actual record depression symptoms

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:10,970
yeah you might enjoy this documentation

00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:24,509
this actually written back

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,310
they might help and so here he is here's

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,290
this super smart dissertations flight

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,050
trailer homes I thought I can't be any

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,440
minute so I'm just going to grab what he

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,700
wrote I'm gonna throw it

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:48,000
and we're all out of dozens so here the

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,860
first seven more precarious right

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,770
is a regular expression to match that

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:59,060
here your regular expression system

00:05:52,770 --> 00:06:04,139
a strength the image being a black baby

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:07,159
carrot this laughs I call it a carrot is

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,159
a regular President Bush

00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:15,469
we all come on that strength starting

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:18,550
the line is basically two strings that

00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:22,249
we applied new idea or buried your mind

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:27,099
so carrot matches is null caregiving

00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:27,099
line dollar was the opposite

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,730
dot expressions

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,920
here we go

00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,410
we're not talking about a real well here

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:04,940
talk about serological beginning of line

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:09,220
so you can think about caring that spot

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,220
in between the people on character and

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,980
character

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:35,280
I mean today no character probably

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:40,110
something out there literally this is

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:45,450
using some old lightning now this is a

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:49,140
character characters enclosed by square

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:53,010
brackets and this matches anything any

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:56,700
single character from identity so to

00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:01,560
have a character class ABCD pull an A or

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,050
B or C or need and you can actually

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,520
shorten these by using damaged students

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:12,210
a eight dash C say you want to match all

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,510
his letters every way the uppercase

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:20,030
letters that's characterized the next

00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,030
one is a character class

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:47,800
everything that isn't in this heat star

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,250
and back and other shelves where it

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,660
basically means anything while in

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,610
regular expressions it's a little

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:59,320
different and for once we're finished

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:05,320
reading first one change is not great

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:10,000
depression stars peek at Kitty's zero or

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:13,050
more of the previous record so if I say

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,050
a star

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:26,890
a zero so now we see how we're starting

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:31,930
to build a set of atoms which would

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:40,330
express most any string are illegal

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:43,210
there are too many more so two adjacent

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,050
regular expressions make up regular

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,050
credit which match

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,410
AC

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:09,880
those two together make your out regular

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,880
his regular group combination

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:23,820
then we have this alternation stop

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:28,830
reading screen we have this all fans or

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:35,160
bored or bars and regular expression

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:42,170
left side 433 like a nap a star p star

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,170
and i would match one more zero wars

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:52,340
for ball and then we have parentheses

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,769
now finally Charlie gift with this last

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:59,660
bit of parentheses we can

00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:03,920
which any parentheses let us make sub

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:09,259
expressions so the example here is a an

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,769
impaired a B or C followed by so this is

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:18,100
saying the net pay on the one side and

00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,100
the D on the other we have B or C I

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:27,819
think there aren't any words and now

00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:32,449
getting interesting these are examples

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:39,040
back in the 60s but they're still true

00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:45,279
today this will still work instead I

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:50,269
emacs rep he traveled all the grounds

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,429
you name this all still works ABCD

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:57,370
little foreign enemies of the inning

00:11:52,429 --> 00:12:06,850
wrecker a horsey

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:06,850
or see a stark example imagine

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:18,410
babies and so

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:21,350
carrot begin in dollar edges in too deep

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:27,110
into the now here are little bit more

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:28,730
complex carrot begin dot star in so that

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,300
dot star you're going to see that a lot

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:37,460
of really great any character that's the

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:41,150
all star Z will workers so can even that

00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,920
since match anything or nothing this

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,040
match is a line that starts with begin

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,240
has anything or nothing in between and

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:54,500
ends with in line you just need to get

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,410
in it could be begin quick brown fox

00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,500
jumped everything else back in both of

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:05,630
those back because this dot star imagine

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:10,130
even questions we good

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:13,040
go get carrot dollar together matches it

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:18,820
in Tijuana there's nothing to be doing

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:21,670
that sheriff beginning dollar in India

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,980
blank

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:31,010
now we've got a DC followed by a

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:35,150
character class more semantic ABC

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:43,880
followed by a single digit and then the

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:46,880
final in here maybe see this match

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,880
acknowledged

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,860
business

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,860
if you write

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:14,470
and other other other flavors we're not

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:24,589
getting that delayed there are claims

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:34,910
some flavors are so girl just one one of

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:41,290
the big innovators improves so they will

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:41,290
put back / deep in class to represent

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:54,770
let me not side you're off you go okay

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:59,830
where are they use rep and said text

00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:03,070
editor ed XD I you max no and plus text

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,070
these either

00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:14,000
programming languages yes the C C++ off

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:15,870
pearl javascript really nearly all

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,750
you've got something that's been around

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:23,029
this long since even before the c

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,029
language was invented in find this way

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:44,480
others see class I see I knees tight

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:49,259
legs which is a wager let's go online

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,279
why this is the unix toilet right

00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,279
programs do

00:15:52,499 --> 00:16:10,540
programs together by programs and text

00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:13,779
because this is so very smart guy very

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,179
important one that I use every day

00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:21,189
constantly I'm sure a lot of you do we

00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:24,429
will use pipes everything else and when

00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:28,629
he's out lining is a big reason why

00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:31,989
regular trains or so today because least

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:34,329
in the kitchen medical text is still the

00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:36,610
University of Memphis we find text

00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:39,519
everything you can parcel from anywhere

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,249
from the output eating program tell you

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,739
needed a system of dimension you get

00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:50,980
texts and you didn't like that very much

00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:52,869
right then you can do things ok an

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,259
example you guys notice murdered this

00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:58,299
game draws anybody like this everybody

00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,759
who invest okay we got some heads up

00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:06,159
we've also received drops this is my

00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:08,220
wife she sent me this one right it's a

00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,740
singer on stage surrounded like

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:16,970
these letters I feel like he could not

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:19,620
figure them letters in ad you I see I

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,699
like I know obviously they're like stock

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:32,280
come on well that day yes I drunk be

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:34,200
blank so what I did what do I you know I

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:41,600
bust out rivers freshman research

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,600
perfect so you know every there we copy

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:49,110
not exhaustive but it's pretty dark days

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:51,600
and here on easing grip graph is the

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,659
famous tool to use a regular brushing

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,750
against some text and here's my

00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:03,360
character class composed of E and a DUI

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:07,110
from from the game this is a repeat

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,440
count saying I want eight matches as you

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,440
care

00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:19,779
so I want a line that starts with an ins

00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,539
good excuse me contains eight of these

00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:25,559
lips I got three answers and of course

00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:42,999
the top line audience you know baseball

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:45,190
obviously that's what I so yes okay now

00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:50,019
you know last time we got some moves

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:53,700
weapons I like like my life I like it

00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:57,759
more because I broke jail you know I

00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,929
like it I like it I like it I like it

00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,180
the Linux Mac all these things

00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:05,670
previously

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,730
we're all bringing unix the video

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,870
because when I started in this business

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,600
they don't want you to get your hands on

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:16,050
the X was if you work for company that

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:21,690
paid a bunch of my son to license their

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:24,170
offer there was a time when you could

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:28,100
not get your hands on unix yourself

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,800
these days you can and not only can you

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:36,570
you can get it in something like this

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:46,310
and you can login something like this so

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:56,210
this is this is me and my older mr. year

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:56,210
but that's a process and here is Eddie

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:05,460
do it and what am i anyway I'm editing

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:08,250
it with and Ed is program and editor

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:13,410
that I showed you in this visual it

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:15,990
takes quite a high you know it's 20 year

00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:19,800
old program and here it is running on

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:22,800
iphone let it be edited using a regular

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:27,059
spray and what did i do it triggers

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,100
right about the line on one using the

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:35,970
rate expression bone just a little

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:38,070
literal characters are you I went to the

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,550
next

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:46,950
and then I use a replacement replace

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:50,640
regular brushing Falls liberals free so

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:58,440
this is what I low credit just to make

00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:01,560
sure I changed the way up on it so this

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,500
is this these are this is regularly

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:12,620
precious on an iphone to do something

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:12,620
useful to change one of the chamber go

00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:25,220
okay fine is you can can't work on

00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:31,879
command line without eventually find out

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:34,159
this file press and find fine gives you

00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:36,580
a lot out it looks a little bit like

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,889
they're less but there's extra stuff

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:44,269
behind those are in their walk counts

00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:48,379
around here more than just one LS music

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:52,879
but still it's text and texted universe

00:21:48,379 --> 00:22:00,850
articles that we do with it so was I

00:21:52,879 --> 00:22:05,680
trying to do when I was matching

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:09,010
today I wanted to see so I probably make

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:22,510
this line in June I probably want to see

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:27,250
all the files that were from Jude what

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:30,280
is this couching me well how many how

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,880
many times of something out okay here I

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:44,470
am so you can see the twenty twelve days

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:47,680
Here I am Here I am having looking at a

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,450
csv export from this butter program and

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:58,290
I wouldn't see how many times did my

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:58,290
part in this body breath so again grip

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:09,200
module which lets you use jewelry

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:12,200
txt file or any items in that's what's

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:21,190
cool the name Brett actually comes from

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:25,460
began it has a command which is G

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:27,420
following instruction call Marky Jesus

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,510
globally bronx river

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:35,850
Jesus print the output so somebody said

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:40,760
something broke man on to land holding

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:43,230
correct the jeans print so that's breath

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,650
he grabbed is just a variant of grim

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:53,840
gives a little bit more flavorful record

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:53,840
great so I go for coffee just

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,130
starting with the carrots as a at the

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:08,250
beginning in the law and this is what I

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:08,250
got and then I use the C switch to catch

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:22,390
into some more morning already I'm

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:24,370
saying show me the dates for the day's

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,670
charged with Eric last one through five

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:34,200
followed by character

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:43,570
+ + in life star stars is zero or more

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:46,960
plus watch at least one and then

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:53,820
followed by co so how many times in the

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,820
first five months of the year did i buy

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:04,780
slightly more involved which is the last

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:07,750
yes just the last 15 so six through nine

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:11,830
that's the sixth seventh eighth ninth

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:17,680
but for 10 10 11 and 12 I have one

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:21,940
followed by 02 and here's a portal and

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,070
this is a subgroup so you can start to

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,919
see

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:29,830
more involved but you can also see big

00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:36,220
impression like you say very good

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:44,380
quality things lets you manage except

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:50,409
the presentation or you don't does

00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:53,039
anybody know his ins listen right bye so

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:53,039
we are

00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:47,640
usually a star we got so here regardless

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:55,500
this loss we got some into the room

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:58,390
right and they all know that the syslog

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,429
messages Islam all of that occasions

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:05,110
about an outer system and you need two

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:12,220
small regular expressions are very good

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:12,760
way to a bunch of textual so here I'm

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,130
giving

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,490
and just showing the first behind exist

00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:20,860
all contacts I can see what happens

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:26,290
syslog line starts for the day and that

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:29,260
has the name of system said mostly the

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:35,290
name of the program some square brackets

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:39,730
call and then it sounds will avenge this

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:46,150
but in my directory I have a bunch of

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:51,310
systems just lost 12 these are always

00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:54,430
and I want to go so I need to use cat

00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:58,900
with the first cup and see cat look at

00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:05,160
the last and that's easy number two if

00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:09,040
you put that emergencies left hand side

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:12,190
so all that says is cat all this s locks

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:16,110
compression and then I'm cutting it fall

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:19,509
and awk is really for useful tools

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,610
show me a sympathy I got you downrange

00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:25,179
right sometimes it's easier to just use

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:30,759
it to like cut off so I asked for the

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:37,809
fifth cup which is going to be robot

00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:46,080
Timmy the line started here and here I'm

00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:46,080
saying throw away the coal throw away

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,350
gonna watch me rebate so this is when

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,540
you said this is what you call it like

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,480
this when they're how to stand up here

00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:05,309
number remember or rather really their

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:08,940
own regular expressions so here's a

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:12,120
replacement this basically says literal

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:19,050
squareback followed by V number V news

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:21,390
followed by literal basically done is I

00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,800
stripped off everything except this

00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,900
purgatory and then I'm counting that's

00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,929
what you need vanished events it counts

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:35,010
in eternal of course you need only works

00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:37,110
on sort of input so there's a sort and

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,080
then I'm sewing that again because this

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:43,120
time don't wanna see an America count in

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,880
reverse order I don't understand

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,150
so this basically shift all that long

00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,240
line shows me what are the noisiest

00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,450
things on my system so in these log

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,780
files the noise these things occur

00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:00,930
14,000 830 network managers the second

00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,930
point

00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:16,420
so you can do a lot

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:19,330
you can ask complicated questions like

00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:22,590
what is the noisiest thing on my system

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:28,920
in terms of walls that's the moment

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:28,920
unless anybody was desperate I'm moving

00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:44,560
how I saw that on my favorite let's save

00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:48,550
my life so this and it's a tool that

00:30:44,560 --> 00:31:00,400
around very well versed on poverty it's

00:30:48,550 --> 00:31:04,600
not just so here i am doing / this is

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:09,760
showing all the other parts starting

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:11,530
with the root here

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,670
this is just give you some context about

00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:17,320
oh yes but one of these of these columns

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,990
so there are columns the domain what

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:24,430
command has applied the second column

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:26,320
process idea that this first element the

00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,560
first 13 lines was in it that's the idea

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:35,550
one next the user that I was that

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:39,640
process next what it is cds are directly

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:42,670
text and these are how Alex

00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:49,570
library assistant texting them or open

00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:51,640
boxes you read or write what type of

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:57,730
thing is it a directory or regular

00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:03,840
father what device is old so disks under

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,840
linux have major and minor lesson 18 17

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:21,779
yeah on the previous

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:34,380
in the second yeah it is indeed now

00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:38,250
there's a semicolon so says programming

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:41,400
language in them and you can actually

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,320
has things like branching you can say if

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,280
i manage something Frank to this point

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,350
my script to do these other things so if

00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,630
you can make actually quite reflects a

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:55,260
script this kind of how do you know the

00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:58,440
way that puzzles are fun sure you can

00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:16,890
break out and pearl do something nice

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:21,500
and long or you break up said never it's

00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:24,980
impossible I did that guy your possible

00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,980
so right

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:36,040
well first of all I see all of aisles

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:52,060
all the real that were open by my user

00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:54,370
agent so the replies like I said you so

00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:57,430
he grabbed here that's putting a space

00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:02,340
followed by DG followed by one or more

00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:02,340
spaces receiving have a space plus

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,770
these lines follow my identity so zero

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:19,060
they're not as a character class

00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:21,450
division singly and that's an easy way

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,450
to

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:31,389
and then you can do more things with

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:35,470
Alison so here same idea open files and

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:41,919
this time I want to see all of the

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:46,149
processes that our files open under

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:50,079
garhwal I don't see what process as the

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:52,899
bottle and what file so easy enough to

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,500
do what else left again text numerous

00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:58,510
clarifies regularly and here so I

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,280
started back slightly we have talked

00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,280
about this movie this is one of those

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:09,420
nice new additions

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:22,630
that's like the z byrd separate memory

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:28,600
boundary yes those damn I said boundary

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:30,100
easily we're back we go earlier when I

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,910
said Garrett matches that sort of

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:36,850
logical space between the new line next

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:40,020
character wolf down matches sort of

00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:44,770
logical place between a word character

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:48,630
is not an important character is defined

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,630
as letters or numbers

00:35:52,020 --> 00:36:06,520
then a not like space anything else so

00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:08,860
now he's very useful so I'm looking for

00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:13,740
a boundary followed by single followed

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:19,869
by one or more bjs followed by double

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:23,350
and then dot star any number of

00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:26,350
additional character and finding / bars

00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:29,800
basketball and you can see what that

00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:32,730
match is part great so when we're

00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:41,110
Valerie is here and here's my teaching

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:45,340
eww and here's the dot star here is the

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:47,530
ball so that's one and then I'm going to

00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,099
use a little bit of said because all i

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:54,749
really want is that first

00:36:50,099 --> 00:37:00,440
and this last bit which is they comply

00:36:54,749 --> 00:37:08,099
so they said really simple space and

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:12,529
then another not / replace that adjust

00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:16,979
the space so you can see this space

00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:19,739
matches here and then any number of

00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:25,440
characters that are not slack takes me

00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:27,359
all the way over to this verse / and

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,170
when I think that instead place that

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,559
tourney with space this is that's what I

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:43,979
wanted the burgers what neighborhood

00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:46,920
want to see 15 easy to do that's left

00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:49,640
walk so do we like these examples are

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,640
you must speak to you

00:37:50,770 --> 00:38:01,200
so keep going so here

00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:11,780
this is the same thing you remember so

00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:16,859
we're common goal say is like like golf

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:18,359
programming in golf training uses few

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:21,840
swings as possible will you write

00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:23,700
scripts newsletters impossible but if

00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,859
you don't like sitting on even though

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,590
there are lots of their meeting other

00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:30,450
tools that do the same thing just a

00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,720
little bit more verbose and some people

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,520
would say a little bit more standard so

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,270
this is the same thing as the last room

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,570
but done before so this time I'm asking

00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:45,869
all to print the same and i'm using

00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:50,490
dollar for so for column I'm saying

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:52,250
needs to match w doll so this time it's

00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:56,420
a little bit different paradigm because

00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:59,079
mark has already grown line into fields

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,259
so now we're talking about losing

00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:09,339
against the contents of field instead of

00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:12,759
against so dollar for is this you don't

00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:15,339
see an example if you remember before it

00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:20,619
was a number followed by W in the case

00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:24,160
is unfinished and then it's a double

00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:26,319
ever since it will fall apart and the

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,039
ninth field needs to match regular

00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:33,630
expression beginning of slack are so

00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:36,160
this is the ninth table and carrot

00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,779
getting a line from this base to getting

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:43,660
a feed / bar and then off let me

00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:46,779
practice is like this is a nice print

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:53,490
statement which says the wall first are

00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:55,470
they would fit a column 15

00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,650
and then the rest so that's the same

00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:04,890
thing as before any other paper to write

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:07,110
lots of tools that's it it's all the

00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:12,069
examples so let's talk about Justin

00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:16,719
constant like not

00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:19,499
he likes it that boy is ready I think

00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,690
why these are so great white is doomed

00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:26,199
well of course Google uses all over the

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:30,130
place inside under the hood in their

00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:33,289
programs and their screams there's even

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:37,650
a Google engineer who's one

00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:46,759
of all time and he's the guy who turned

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:46,759
me off for syphilis Val Venis no good

00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:53,880
goalies are your friends but they dumped

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:59,279
exposed regular expressions they don't

00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:03,539
let you go to google and there's at

00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:07,610
least one reason probably a lottery but

00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:09,620
a big ones performance it's very easy

00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:13,990
make a regular braid which is

00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,990
arbitrarily complex

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:22,260
if you book stall and then some string

00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:27,570
and you ask Google search terabytes of

00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:29,430
data dot star can you picture it would

00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:32,240
just it would be Google horse typing

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:36,530
that would be match could never ever

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:40,880
because it would just keep searching

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:46,560
there's also a concept vector

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:53,150
backtracking is essential to how if I

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,150
say food da start off don't start

00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:07,160
Michael without our bars the national

00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:07,160
thing because the job start until the

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:19,079
end we've got Evan bring because it's

00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:24,260
free it's gonna cool it doesn't

00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:28,010
magically because it's possible that

00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,010
hardens during earlier

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:45,950
so green means effector backtrack

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:51,830
consumes alongside it can use it now so

00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:58,100
a lot of programs very sensitive one

00:42:51,830 --> 00:43:01,960
for many years now the store so I I'm a

00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,960
performance engineer now at last

00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:13,609
this process

00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:25,630
why and legally trained to those tactics

00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:29,020
in many cases now they're not fast

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:31,180
enough for us to be exclusive but they

00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:36,780
are best not for us to use them to make

00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,780
the final say wow this looks suspicious

00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,520
so records right can they do this

00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:04,710
so if you're open to be a more chances

00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:08,430
are you're never going to if you're

00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:10,410
writing stuff to process in a gigabit

00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:17,570
efforts you need to be genuine

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:23,190
performers there's a range obviously is

00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:25,550
very large and he marks a large number

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,550
drinking

00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:36,020
these expressions

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:46,260
range from 4,000 some odd nanoseconds to

00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:51,310
maybe on down so now you're talking my

00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:53,920
cursor not my set but again if you're

00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:59,260
processing terabytes and terabytes yeah

00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,740
you gotta be where he does at math we

00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:06,520
want to use regular patients typically

00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,770
wear math is called you try and land it

00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,460
like that the person you're trying to

00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:19,570
match a rain containing in contiguous

00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:22,450
numbers that's hard oh it's easy to

00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:24,820
express our back you can say if you see

00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,830
a number and the next number is one left

00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:31,070
lasting for the next one

00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:34,340
that's easy to stay chromatic it's hard

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:37,450
to sit irregular grade I can't really

00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:41,480
say is this current regular expression

00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:43,670
one greater requirement unless you start

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:50,870
again character classes that are just

00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:56,380
enormous so that's not generic XML

00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:56,380
parsing this is the stuff of flame more

00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:08,840
regular dragons cannot truly parse XML

00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:14,330
but nobody uses xml and they truly

00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:18,010
generic right everyone uses subset it's

00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:21,710
only really meaningful if you know what

00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:23,840
what's interesting but the content if

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,300
there are parts of the xml

00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,440
recognizing the action that's the only

00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,820
time I smell contributed me you can't

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,680
can't truly do anything more wild

00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,980
accident you're trying to approach it

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,890
from the standpoint I do nothing about

00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:46,640
learning doesn't so the general case

00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:48,920
parsing suppose but in the specific case

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,110
where we know what they expose don't

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:58,820
look like typically because you or

00:46:51,110 --> 00:47:01,660
someone sitting or someone in those

00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,660
changes

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:16,130
it's for Jason home faster somebody's

00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:22,309
serialization I change in ipv4 addresses

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:28,220
and I can use experience here's an

00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:30,410
example I before up an equity for and

00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:33,910
this is what I call cheater this is a

00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:38,930
cheeky no because it will match all

00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:45,499
before and illegal addresses dresses

00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:55,700
they're not legal 300 300 300 is not

00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:59,720
legal but this this list of my few

00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:03,579
dresses that's legal do I care but if

00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,579
you need to be able to tell illegal

00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:09,699
complicated pretty sure I've written one

00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:18,819
here that tries to

00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:30,109
and it literally is this breakdown Linda

00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:35,859
25 or two and that's just the first

00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:38,449
object so that gives you 19 what can do

00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:42,249
when you run to or what you might find

00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:42,249
just saying you've any news

00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:55,150
oh so this is kind of begin I can talk

00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:58,050
about the Hawks permission or questions

00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,050
we call it a bit

00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:34,900
your customers rely on your website or

00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,300
application if it's slower

00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:40,240
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,040
and costs you money keeping your

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,550
business critical systems humming along

00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,860
requires insight into what they're doing

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,840
your system metrics tells stories

00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,850
stories that can reveal performance

00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,160
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,720
other problems but how do you keep an

00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,390
eye on all of your systems performance

00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,390
metrics in real-time and record this

00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,160
data for later analysis enter longview

00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,200
the new way to see what's really going

00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,330
on under the hood the long view

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,400
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,860
of all your systems providing you with a

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,250
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:17,830
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,570
load and network usage click a specific

00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:21,970
system to access its individual

00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:24,480
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,890
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,570
comprehensive network data including

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,880
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,440
available on the network tab and disk

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,360
rights and free space on the disk

00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,210
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,730
displays usage statistics for individual

00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,920
processes the system info tab shows

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,170
listening services active connections

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,300
and available updates adding long view

00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,980
to a system is easy just click the

00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,140
button copy the one line installation

00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,570
command then run the command on your

00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,280
linux system to complete the process the

00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:56,440
agent will begin collecting data and

00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,319
sending it to longview then the graph

00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,869
start rolling

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,239
use longview to gain visibility into

00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:06,979
your servers so when your website or app

00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:06,979
heats up it stays up

00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:15,229
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:17,179
ago we could not have imagined that

00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:19,369
asterisk would not only become the most

00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:21,529
widely adopted open source communication

00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:23,569
software on the planet but that it would

00:51:21,529 --> 00:51:26,089
impact the entire industry in the way

00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:28,069
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:30,679
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:32,660
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:34,759
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,140
transition of power from the hands of

00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:38,419
the traditional proprietary phone

00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,819
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:51:38,419 --> 00:51:42,739
administrators of phone systems using

00:51:40,819 --> 00:51:43,969
this power our customers have created

00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:45,919
all sorts of business changing

00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:47,779
applications from small office phone

00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:50,299
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:51,890
the international carrier networks in

00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:53,689
fact there's even an entire country

00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:56,059
those communications infrastructure runs

00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:58,189
on Astra's the gym has always been about

00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:59,900
creating technology that expands

00:51:58,189 --> 00:52:02,089
communications capabilities in ways that

00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,289
we could never have imagined and that's

00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:05,660
part of what's game-changing about

00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:08,359
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,459
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:12,589
IP phones that extends control of the

00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:14,329
user all the way to the desktop the

00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:16,039
launch of these new products represents

00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:18,019
the next phase indigenous history of

00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:20,539
innovation these are the first and only

00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:21,890
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:23,569
power of esther's when we first

00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,799
discussed our expectations for building

00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:26,689
a family of phones for use with

00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:28,909
asterisks our requirements were pretty

00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:30,259
simple we asked the team to build the

00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:32,599
phones such that they were easy to

00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:34,819
install integrate provision and use I

00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,829
think you'll soon agree our engineers

00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:38,630
have delivered on that goal user

00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:40,249
feedback is validating that when it

00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,679
comes to operation with asher space

00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:44,630
systems including our own Switchvox

00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:47,299
based product these are the easiest to

00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:49,640
use best integrated most interoperable

00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:51,319
products on the market today the Digium

00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,049
family of phones will initially include

00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:55,969
three IP des hommes uniquely designed to

00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:57,829
complement any asterisk or Switchvox

00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:59,929
based solution these phones are

00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:02,119
different for a number of reasons first

00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:04,400
there is clue sively designed for use

00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:06,019
with esters secondly we've made it

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,419
really easy to autodiscover and

00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:09,589
provision the phones next we've made it

00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:12,109
easy for the phones to access

00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:13,789
information inside of asterisks allowing

00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,240
tight coupling between an application

00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:16,850
and

00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,010
phone additionally we've created an

00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,110
applications engineer that allows users

00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:23,720
and developers to create and run their

00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,790
own apps on the following and finally

00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,830
we've done all of this at a very

00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,540
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,310
always thinking of ways to give our

00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,680
customers the best value in business

00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,570
phone systems and also give them the

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,700
power to create their own solutions or

00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:39,500
any communications challenge well

00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,300
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,340
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,960
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,420
asterisk and web communications even

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,860
easier and together we'll change the way

00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,860
the world communication again

00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:08,350
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:10,540
way to better utilize all your resources

00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:13,990
and it makes managing all your resources

00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:17,820
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:21,340
happening in open source the

00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:23,110
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,060
of the community and then the speed at

00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:26,950
which these are these you know these

00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,900
these deficiencies these bugs are

00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,480
getting discovered and then fixed is

00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,920
that like that really shows the power of

00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,680
the you know of the open source

00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,830
community it is global and it's

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,380
definitely because of the users

00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:47,020
community people are extremely friendly

00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:48,910
and they're always ready to help if you

00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:51,190
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,920
guys helping each other out and they're

00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,630
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,620
the product is transparent for everyone

00:54:55,630 --> 00:55:01,810
everyone can look at the code base

00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:04,050
everyone can see how close duck is being

00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:09,550
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:12,130
everything is open in many ways it's

00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:16,630
absolutely vital to the the unborn

00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:20,830
health cloudstack the most exciting

00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:23,660
event in recent memory for he was our

00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:26,299
first developer boot camp

00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:28,970
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:55:26,299 --> 00:55:32,930
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:37,099
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:39,920
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:42,470
chairs in the room twice everything

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,799
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:48,770
is open source and so I don't think that

00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:50,539
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,569
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:56,299
computing and so i think it's i think

00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:57,650
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:55:56,299 --> 00:55:58,760
about cloud computing you're really

00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:04,309
talking about open source cloud

00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:07,339
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:09,470
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:13,760
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:16,430
in each data centers these hardware is

00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,910
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:22,609
to handle number one that mass scale

00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:25,789
number two it's designed to handle the

00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:28,339
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:31,880
deployments started working on college

00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:35,210
attack over four years ago and it was

00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,910
the original set of people working on it

00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:41,990
had a background of delivering software

00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:46,250
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:49,849
lots of users actually using it high

00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:52,940
availability is a key feature multiple

00:56:49,849 --> 00:56:54,950
hypervisors support different network

00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,650
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:59,900
you better while step management server

00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:03,589
can be deployed in different physical

00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:05,240
machines it definitely has a huge

00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:10,220
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:12,829
there's a major movie studio that they

00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:16,010
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:18,079
to transcode video and i thought that

00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,730
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,000
more fascinating is what they did during

00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:25,789
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,930
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:28,790
lunch was over they would dis

00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:33,050
all the instances and go back to doing

00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:34,550
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:36,619
so many different aspects and there's no

00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:39,020
one person that's kind of like a master

00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:43,130
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:45,349
as a project is going to be one of the

00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:49,400
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:54,829
most feature fallen and and robust

00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:57,730
platforms out they were I don't senior

00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:57,730
living through the clouds dag

00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:15,670
most enterprises today realize that

00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:17,320
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:19,690
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,760
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:23,800
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,930
popular lately that adds that extra

00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,570
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,340
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:32,560
know is that some two-factor

00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,780
authentication solutions they're better

00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:37,810
than others like two-factor strong

00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:40,090
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:42,040
beyond other authentication systems by

00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:45,100
being less expensive easier to implement

00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,590
and easier to use giving software-based

00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:50,410
token clients built to run on all major

00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:53,040
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:55,390
Android these tokens utilize a

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,820
public/private key combination that's

00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,740
generated on device so there aren't any

00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,260
shared secrets flying around for

00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:05,110
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,970
special handling instead all keys are

00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:09,430
kept secure and private between the

00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,620
requesting token and your server which

00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:13,260
you control aim house making it the most

00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,910
secure way possible to perform

00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:18,760
authentication encryption and with an

00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:21,520
extensive flexible API that support for

00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,470
protocols like LDAP and radius wicket

00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,680
works with any enterprise network
