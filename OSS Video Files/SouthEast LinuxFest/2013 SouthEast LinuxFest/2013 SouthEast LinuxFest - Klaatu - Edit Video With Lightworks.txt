the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280

linux fest visit w WC selinux phase or

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,810
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,840
2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,850
possible all right hi everyone my name

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:39,290
is car too and this is a light works

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:43,559
cross-platform video editing alright so

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:46,980
who am i I'm Klaatu at member FSF org if

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,570
you want to contact me for any reason

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,440
you can email me there I'm also the site

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,649
maintainer owner of light working net

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,940
which is a very modest right now site

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,010
dedicated to light work tutorials so

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,740
after this talk is finished and you've

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,570
forgotten everything that I said you can

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,000
go to light working net and find at

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,860
least three pretty good tutorials on the

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,869
subject and then I've got a couple of

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,259
magazine articles coming out in a couple

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,850
of Linux magazines about light working

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,030
so there's going to be plenty of reading

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,920
material for you after this talk some of

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,140
its free online some of it you'll have

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,829
to buy at the bookstore i'm also the

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,590
maintainer of slacker media which is a

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:39,540
website dedicated to doing multimedia on

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,520
that's not it multimedia on linux i work

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,220
at pittsburgh filmmakers institute in

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,930
real life so I do a lot of multimedia

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,490
stuff and I do it all on Linux the whole

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,799
school doesn't do it all on Linux but I

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,869
personally do all my work on linux so

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,420
this is basically a conglomeration and

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,360
sort of aggregation of everything that I

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,240
learned doing real multimedia stuff

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,670
that's going to be shown in a in an art

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,220
house theater you know getting it to be

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,759
ready for that on Linux so you can check

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,099
that site out

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,799
i'm also the maintainer of straight edge

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,140
linux com which is a tutorial site that

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:20,090
you can go to some time new world order

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,769
info which is my podcast and hacker

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,290
public radio which is another podcast

00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:28,720
that i contribute to so that's that's

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:31,489
who I am that's why you're here sort of

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,190
advantages to light works okay so a

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:38,120
couple of caveats before I start light

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,920
works is quote being open sourced with

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,299
the emphasis on the eng light works

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,489
about a year ago a company called

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,739
editshare which was selling light works

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:50,840
and a bunch of hardware consoles and

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,400
these Hardware consoles were sort of jog

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,950
dials and buttons it was like a

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,659
specialized keyboard that editors really

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,810
liked using because it made them think

00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:05,750
of old film reel editing stations called

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:07,879
I just blanked on the name man I just I

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,440
just blank on the name anyway it made

00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,549
them think of these old editing systems

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,930
flatbed editors Stein Steinbeck's so

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,579
they really liked it it was like a

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,430
couple of grand it was a very expensive

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:21,680
solution very sort of designed for

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,849
professional why isn't that all showing

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:31,780
up on the screen kind of designed more

00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:33,799
for the professional editing group so

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,900
editshare announced what we're going to

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,280
open source light works and give the

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,230
software away you can still buy the

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,060
specialized controller for like three

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,919
thousand dollars or whatever it is sort

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,430
of ridiculous but but the software will

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,109
be free so I was an alpha tester for

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,180
light works and I am currently a beta

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:54,739
tester and you can be to you can go to

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,510
light works l WK l wks calm and download

00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,099
a beta copy for yourself and try it out

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,669
you can post on their forums about all

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:03,620
the bugs that you find the thing is it's

00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,540
been a year now they've got a Windows

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,280
port which already existed they've got a

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,560
Linux port and they've got a they're

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,019
working on the mac support the mac port

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,030
but i haven't actually seen any of the

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,099
source code so when they say it's open

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,479
source i don't know if that means what

00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,579
they're saying is that it means that

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,500
once they are ready for it to be open

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,780
source they will release the code to

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,360
everyone but just so you know i have not

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,340
the source code yet there's there's

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
people have talked about it people have

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,220
mentioned it and that's that's what

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,900
they're saying is that they're going to

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,880
release it when they're ready that's not

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,650
unprecedented it's kind of like ubuntu's

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,510
working model if you think about it so

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,180
that light works is kind of doing this

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,190
isn't all that you know it's not it's

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,430
not completely strange I don't love it

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,990
but that's how it is right now so just

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,480
who knows then six months if they betray

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,639
my trust this talk might be all for

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,460
naught but right now it's it's

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,169
supposedly going to be open sourced and

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,260
and to their credit I've talked to them

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,210
a lot about packaging light works for

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,520
slackware and someone is currently

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,260
packaging it for fedora and they've been

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,570
really really helpful so if that's any

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,120
indication of what they really do intend

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,860
I have a pretty good feeling that we

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,010
will eventually see source code for

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,600
light works the big deal about light

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,760
works right now I think is that it's

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,910
cross-platform it's cross-platform it's

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,590
very mature it will be work it's already

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,419
working on Windows and Linux it's going

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,190
to work on the Mac so no matter what

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,660
you're going to be able to give people

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:37,440
if a no cost editing video editing

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:41,640
solution hopefully it'll also be free

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,560
software another advantage to light

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,780
works is that it is a structured editing

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,490
model for offline editing and match back

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,070
which none of you even know what that

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,390
means but for if people are talking to

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,430
you about video editing and how they

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,440
need professional video editing blah

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,570
blah blah that's what they need they

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,360
need structured video editing they need

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,830
offline editing they need the ability to

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,479
bring their offline stuff back online

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,150
basically it's got to do with

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,640
resolutions downscaling your video so

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:12,270
that you can actually edit it on a home

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:16,200
computer and not on a beowulf cluster of

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,810
a bunch of boxes so being able and

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,120
having it designed to to gracefully

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,750
offline and online is a very important

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,280
and significant feature that really

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,740
should make the professionals that the

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,030
real professionals no not very happy

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,180
disadvantages like I said I haven't seen

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,590
the source code yet so that is that it

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,600
is some for some people

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,100
the structured editing aspect is going

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,960
to be a disadvantage like a lot of

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,340
people will love how structured it is

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,890
and you'll see what i mean by that in a

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,720
minute but some people love that some

00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,340
people who grew up on like Final Cut

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,680
where you can just drag and drop things

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,600
and drop them everywhere and just not

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,730
really worried about your time code and

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,310
whether you're using clips that don't

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,980
actually exist in the full res version

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,180
they have a very hard time sort of

00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,730
dealing with something that actually

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,240
tracks your footage so for some people

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,340
as a disadvantage it requires

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,530
registration which is weird it's a free

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,390
download but you still have to like

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,190
register with light works I don't know

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,620
if that's just during the beta phase or

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,760
if that's just something that they're

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,370
going to use because they're going to

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,710
eventually sell additional codecs like

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,050
so if you are if you're in an avid shop

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,390
and you need a specialized avid codec

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,250
you can buy additional support to plug

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,230
into light works and that'll all be

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,670
managed through the registration I don't

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,250
know if it'll always be everyone who

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:43,540
ever uses light works has to register or

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,130
not no source code yet and also it's

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,740
only being developed right now for

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,870
Ubuntu which I mean in there they're

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,450
being super helpful in repackaging it's

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,180
not that big of a deal I kind of have a

00:07:52,450 --> 00:08:00,190
port working on slackware if you don't

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:05,080
really care about it working oops lib

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:07,360
crypt a shared object error I need to

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,590
like recompile SSL or something like

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,930
that I don't know I haven't looked into

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,550
what that error means that's that's like

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,590
the fifth error in the process I just

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,810
kind of got burned out last week on that

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,820
but but and they're being super helpful

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,100
like every problem i just i post in

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,390
their beta form and say hey why am i

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,140
getting this error what do i need to do

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:28,540
so and they have said that they do

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,790
intend to support more distributions as

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,730
as they get closer to being finished

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,090
with the the code that the port so i

00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:39,370
have a feeling that you know again like

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,510
if if they are to be believed and if

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,800
they if they follow through on what

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,990
they're saying they're going to do i

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,340
think it won't be that big of a deal but

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,400
right now if you want to run it on

00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,160
anything but a boon to it's it's really

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,000
kind of a hack there is a fedora rpm

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,220
that one of the beta

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,500
services put out but in order to get it

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,360
up and running you have to pull in a

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,190
bunch of different versions of libraries

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,010
and I think maybe make a couple of

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,740
symlinks to kind of hack it onto your

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,760
system so it's not it's not a super

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:15,370
graceful process okay that's the end of

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:22,660
my slideshow so now we're going to do

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:28,600
the super awkward transition from one

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:32,220
computer to another and hope that this

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,220
dual monitor thing picks it up

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
or do I have to reboot

00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:05,030
videoguard oh really okay now i think

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,390
i'm using the nouveau drivers though

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,390
nope not

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:32,130
okay cool that'll work thanks right

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:37,230
we're good oh wait is that married are

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:46,260
you seeing what I'm seeing her now now

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:48,440
you're not seeing what I'm seeing there

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,440
you go

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,470
there we go

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,470
apply more time

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,089
ok

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,160
but

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,070
try that trick

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,900
and while we're waiting for me to figure

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:52,140
dual monitor support out on a boon to

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,450
let's i should mention that right now is

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,720
a really good time I think for linux

00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,450
video editors it's a little bit late to

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,510
mention it now but yesterday there was a

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:08,040
talk about kdenlive which I can't

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,480
recommend more and I i recommend it very

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,750
very highly is what I'm trying to say

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,000
it's a great video editor that's the one

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,210
that I use in real life on a daily basis

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,440
at work so if you're if if what you see

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:26,190
today is not quite ready and trust me

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,570
it's not but um it's it's appealing but

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,120
if it's not quite what you're looking

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,839
for right right now you can check out

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,270
kdenlive you can check out open shot and

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:40,490
a pity v is supposed to be really good

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:46,410
too so there's a lot of what's up pit TV

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:50,280
piti VI it's a mostly Python gstreamer

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,410
based application and it's supposed to

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,480
be really good and very much from what i

00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:01,740
understand you know kind of that the old

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:03,900
the old the old imovie model ok cool now

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,690
we are seeing the same thing ok so

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,010
downloading the application itself i

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,390
mean i don't probably have to go over

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,450
that with you it's it's a new boon to

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,250
package you go to the i'm still not

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:18,030
seeing it over here but ok i can work

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:21,390
like this it's an ubuntu package you go

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:27,320
to el wks calm you download the binary

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:30,500
the beta package and you install it it

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:35,550
it comes up with this little icon here

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:39,660
lightworks you click on it and now it's

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,480
loading let's see if it makes me sign in

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,339
or four members who I am okay so

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,940
normally here you'd see a sign in screen

00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,130
which you if you don't have a name or if

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,380
you don't have an account rather you

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,060
would click a little register button

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,520
down here somewhere and it would take

00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,060
you to the el wks website reg

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:07,920
with with with editshare as a light

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:09,600
works user and and then you sign in for

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,660
now we don't need to do that because it

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,590
remembers who i am but we still need to

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:23,490
create a project so i'm not using this

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:28,890
let me get it out of the way it's all

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:31,320
good so a new project is simply you know

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,060
just like in any other application

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,100
you're making a new project file

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,040
essentially it asks you some hard

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,970
questions up front mainly the frame

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,340
rates if you don't know your frame rate

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:49,050
there are lots of ways to find out the

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:51,240
best way is to open up your video file

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,340
that you want to edit or like one of the

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,180
video I the files that you know that you

00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,400
want to edit in VLC and find out what

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,820
what kind of file it is VLC will tell

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,740
you all kinds of information VLC won't

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,150
be installed by default on a boon to but

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,480
again you can just kind of get that from

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:14,640
the Ubuntu Software Center so you've got

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:17,760
a movie file and if you go up to let's

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:23,190
see where is it tools media information

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,810
I think yeah tools media information go

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,610
to the codec tab it tells you all kinds

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,260
of information there's there's other

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,900
programs that will do this for you too

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,390
but this is kind of the the GUI way to

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,330
do it you just kind of look here and it

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,060
says okay you've got a video stream here

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:43,830
its impact for its 1280 by 720 so that's

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,110
720p and it's 20 3.97 which generally

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,580
speaking unless unless your video

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,230
editing application makes it really

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,910
really obvious that even round that up

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,910
to 24 frames per second

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,290
yeah okay that's cool I did not even

00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:16,329
know that that's really neat I'm a que

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,300
te man myself I don't need Nautilus

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:21,399
until now but yeah so apparently you can

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,829
get that in nautilus if if you want to

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,189
that's cool I didn't know that that's

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:33,429
kind of new right that's not that hasn't

00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:35,379
really o.o funny okay so we know it's 24

00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:36,850
frames per second some video editors

00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,679
will give you more options but you it's

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,540
safe to round up and then you just give

00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,579
it a name this is a convention that

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,279
you'll see a lot in light works too to

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:47,649
create anything new you simply give it a

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,629
name which sounds very like spiritual

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,579
and godly you name something and it

00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,019
comes into being so just kind of

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:56,050
remember that because you're going to do

00:16:53,019 --> 00:17:00,850
that a lot so this is actually Noah's

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:02,829
short film at school so i just created a

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:07,329
name for this project and i'll create

00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:09,100
the project now and now it dumps me into

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,709
well it's cheating because i've been

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,110
using it but normally what you'd see is

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,419
just this so as you can see this is a

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,490
full screen application and i'm sorry

00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,890
that the lights really aren't that dim

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,600
in here but this is a full screen

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,520
application you can minimize it with a

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,130
little minimize button up here in the

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,029
upper right corner where ever my mouse

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,470
is right here up in the upper right

00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,630
corner you can minimize it to get back

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,860
to your desktop but but generally

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,330
speaking when you're in light works

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,490
you're sort of in light works that's

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:46,539
kind of the the model that they have set

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:49,149
up for you this is your tool bar over

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:50,919
here on the left and then you've got you

00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:53,020
can barely see it down here on this

00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,340
screen but in real life you'd be able to

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,080
see a lot better you've got another tool

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,940
bar down there you've also got a red

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,330
shark avoid it it's dangerous don't

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,490
touch it it bites so this is our

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,889
workspace and the first thing that you'd

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,520
want to do when you're editing video

00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:09,160
probably is to get

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,800
video into your work space right that's

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:19,150
the top button logically enough so you

00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:21,930
click the import button this is a much

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,460
smaller resolution than I'm used to some

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:28,590
everything's sort of huge right now but

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:33,190
here we are in you know in an import

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,360
menu or a window rather under places you

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,320
can kind of see where this came from

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,150
it's got of my documents a desktop so

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,490
there's no home directory you can't let

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,350
go home so what I usually do is go to my

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,070
documents and then go a folder up and

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,140
then navigate to my to my to my footage

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:56,020
but you could just as easily go out to

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:58,930
your file system go to home and then go

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,980
to to wherever you've got your footage

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:04,540
so this is just a you know a file

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,730
manager essentially of all your footage

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,350
that you you might want to import so

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:13,540
I'll just take some sort of that random

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:15,220
here I'm going to take the the ones that

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,980
I converted so that this presentation

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:22,320
will go a little bit smoother this isn't

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,320
the most powerful box that I own so

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:35,010
yeah yeah there's a whole host of format

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:37,049
problems right now that nasty one aughh

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,419
the aura you know the one that just

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,740
won't work on anything still doesn't

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,150
work on light works i don't know why i

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,100
don't know if they're going to i think

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,990
they're going to make that work I mean

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,990
but like the obvious ones that I usually

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,600
default to for linux xvid and fiora just

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,450
an even web in like light works doesn't

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,630
know that they exist yet so it's kind of

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:03,659
a pain really it's it's but it's early

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:05,600
it's still in beta so give it time well

00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:08,730
that's that's one thing that this does

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,149
support out of the box so yeah this is

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:14,760
light works who has it's a really weird

00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:16,799
conglomeration of like proprietary

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,990
codecs that you don't think should work

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,149
and then the free ones don't work and

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,440
then like other proprietary ones also

00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:25,529
don't work and you have to pay extra for

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,760
them so I don't know I haven't figured

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,260
out the logic there yet and I'm assuming

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,770
that what's happening is that this is

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,649
exactly what the windows origin looked

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:41,309
like and then there as they poured it to

00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:43,710
Windows to Linux and Mac they will once

00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,450
that's done then assuming that they

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,730
really open source of the code then all

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,380
of us can jump in and start bringing in

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,640
like the free codec support and stuff

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,370
like that that's kind of what I'm

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,080
imagining and to be honest even avid

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,789
kind of went to that model which is

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,909
unheard of they don't do that sort of

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:03,960
thing they went with an and an available

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:06,690
api for codec support so this the light

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,580
works may actually do that ok so this is

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:14,610
all the footage that I just now imported

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,710
I guess the to summarize your question

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:20,610
like if you grab a video camera off of

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,340
the modern day yeah it's going to work

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,740
because they're all doing AVCHD and

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,130
light works plays really well with that

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,779
so yeah so this is the footage that I

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,200
just imported now notice that up in the

00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:38,010
right is that the writers at the left

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,299
left left corner it says imports so how

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,379
do we create how do we

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:48,239
save something in light works I just

00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:51,929
told you name it right yeah so I'm going

00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:53,970
to say that this is noah real for

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:58,529
because noah is the guy who directed

00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,539
this thing and it's real for so that's

00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,309
what i'm naming it so now this thing has

00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,470
just been saved which is a really kind

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,259
of weird like in our minds we want to go

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:10,080
up somewhere to a menu and click on file

00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,850
save as or whatever you don't do that in

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,279
light works you've got your project

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,950
everything in your project exists in

00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,799
little windows and as long as you name

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,989
them then they they will persist every

00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,960
time you open up your project but if i

00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:29,190
was to import something from some other

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:35,100
place I'll grab some again just kind of

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:37,019
arbitrarily here now I've got this new

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,480
import window if I don't save this and I

00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,009
close it those things may as well have

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,629
never been imported they don't they

00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:45,749
don't exist they're not available to me

00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:49,590
anymore so whenever you do something

00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:53,369
that you you like in light works you

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:55,549
probably need to name it and and make

00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:59,850
sure that it's going to stick around and

00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:01,230
I think we'll probably have time but I'm

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,179
not going to go into it yet but there is

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,639
a little bit about how to manage that

00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,739
like well okay so if I if I close this

00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:09,179
window how do I get back to it so I

00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,519
don't want to go into that yet because I

00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,049
don't want to I don't want to bog you

00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,279
down with information that doesn't have

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,279
anything to do with video editing

00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,559
no and there yeah there's a there's a

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,419
hole there's a whole thing about media

00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:29,850
management which is a super super

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,100
important sort of concept if you're

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,749
editing something that you want to keep

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,509
around I don't want to get into it yet

00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:37,679
but if either remind me later if we're

00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,989
if we're running out of stuff to talk

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,179
about or go to the site light working

00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:43,559
net and I wrote a whole article on media

00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,080
management in light works because it's

00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,700
just that important like if yeah because

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,710
there's there's differences you can just

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,080
you can link back to the original files

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,970
and edit them or you can say yes take

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,759
those files copy them to this separate

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,399
drive and edit those draw those files so

00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,259
yeah there's there's that's an important

00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:03,029
distinction in this case we're just

00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:07,950
blinking to these files we haven't

00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:09,690
actually copied any bits or bytes okay

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,279
so we've got we've got I mean this this

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,679
probably looks fairly familiar if you've

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,960
ever seen a modern video editor the kind

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,979
of the concept of okay I've got a list

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,539
of all my clips in in one window so now

00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:25,679
what do I do with it well traditionally

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:27,330
what you would do with it is is you

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,349
would look at the footage you would see

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:35,159
what it contains because mvi underscore

00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:37,649
935 3 mov isn't very descriptive so if

00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,509
you see these little you can probably

00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:42,109
tell if I roll over these little these

00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:46,639
clips there's little icons that appear

00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:49,830
over on the right of each of each clip

00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:52,710
so the only one that you really probably

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:56,609
care about initially is the second one

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:58,649
down called viewer so if we want to view

00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:01,679
this clip for instance we would open

00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:05,489
that up as its own viewer this is going

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,529
to work yes and now it kind of opens up

00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:10,220
in this sort of view window and now I

00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:10,220
can view it

00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:22,070
now this is typical for clips i mean if

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:23,359
you're shooting something usually

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,219
there's parts of it that you don't

00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,659
really want actually i don't think we

00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,879
probably want any of that clip that was

00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:33,879
a bad choice apparently all right so

00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:33,879
which one was that think it was that one

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,989
I'm deleting that one because that was

00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:41,889
obviously a bad take so I'm going to

00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:41,889
look at a different one

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,290
okay let's let's say that this is a good

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:56,090
take so I'm going to hit the i key on my

00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:00,150
keyboard I for in and then I'm going to

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,500
click oh when I want to go out so

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,110
basically I'm just telling white works

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,700
yeah I see all of this footage here and

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,070
it all sucks until it gets to this point

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,570
at which point yeah I really like this

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:15,330
stuff and then at some point see this is

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,880
a fight scene so probably when the the

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,650
guys out of frame I would I would want

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,750
to hit oh and that would be kind of like

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,160
my initial kind of rough edit of that

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:27,690
clip that's the good part of that clip

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,280
now I can keep doing that to all of my

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,580
clips if I'm if I'm the kind of person

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,500
who has I know what the scene is I know

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,490
that I just need to kind of keep

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,020
reviewing the footage and sort of

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:44,309
marking the good parts in all of the

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:46,080
clips I can do it that way or if I like

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,480
to piece things together one step at a

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,690
time I could do it that way to either

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,309
way I've made I've made it an edit

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:58,410
decision I've made it I've marked I've

00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:01,590
marked the the footage where it where

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:04,620
it's good and that's going to stick

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:07,440
around because it exists within my

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,490
little import bin but eventually you're

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,330
going to want to put it all together

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:14,460
right into a movie that again pretty

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,770
logically is the second button down over

00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,440
here on your toolbar these little

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,360
multitrack lines click that and that

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,270
creates what you and I would probably

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,360
call a timeline if you've if you've done

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:31,110
any kind of reading or or any lessons on

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,059
on any modern video editor we'd call it

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:37,320
a timeline lightworks calls it and edit

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:41,700
so this is our edit window and if we

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,170
know that we liked this clip usually I

00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,640
don't work on such a small screen I

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:49,410
apologize it's starting to get kind of

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,420
crowded but I can't rig things down so

00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,900
if I liked this clip I want it in my in

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:58,590
my movie for sure then as long as it's

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:02,600
an open window as long as it's an open

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,600
window all I have to do

00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:17,570
where did my edit go that's my real okay

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:20,669
as long as I have this window open I

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,200
know I want it in my movie that's where

00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,260
these buttons at the very very bottom

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,360
come into play you've got to really

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,580
important ones one is replaced and one

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,990
is insert right now neither of them

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,080
really matter all that much because

00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,669
there's nothing in my in my edit so I

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,649
could I could do either one it doesn't

00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:42,539
really matter but to get that clip down

00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:45,000
into my into my actual movie that I'm

00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,559
going to keep I would in this case I'll

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,210
just do an insert and you can see that

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,490
it drops it down here into my little

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:59,279
edit window and so now I can close the

00:28:53,490 --> 00:29:01,380
viewer and now this is my edit of my

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,630
movie so far which consists of one clip

00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,700
which I can play by hitting the spacebar

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:10,860
and we can see it playing back right

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,690
there in that in that window okay so

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,070
it's a one clip movie right now so in

00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,870
order to save this edit and make sure

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:20,490
that it never goes away of course I'm

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:24,510
going to say Noah edit and now this edit

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:28,350
exists as part of the persistent data in

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:30,679
my project am I in my project file so

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,760
there's no I'm never going to save

00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,450
anything that I'm doing here in light

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,720
works I mean if I leave right now if I

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:44,070
close light works and then I open it

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,740
back up there's my project that I've

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,990
that I've been working on and everything

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,669
is restored exactly as I left it I mean

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,669
right down to the window positions

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,899
including like I said all of my little

00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:06,690
import the imported clips the one clip

00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:09,240
that I have in my edit so you don't ever

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,389
you'll never go to a file menu and save

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,980
in light works it's always just the fact

00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:14,530
that you are working in a project and

00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,320
the fact that you

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,330
were naming windows as you work that's

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,360
saving everything as persistent data

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,800
that's the most it's kind of like one of

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,290
the more confusing things like when I

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,080
first started using it I died construct

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,300
a test to edit and then i would i would

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,890
close white works and I'd reopen it in

00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,770
the Edit would be gone it would just be

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,120
there would be no edit there or I would

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,950
just close the window and there would be

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,540
no way to get back to it which is really

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,220
scary and if you didn't name it there

00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,560
really is no way to get back to it it's

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,350
theirs that's you have to name it that's

00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:55,360
the save action in light works so

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:57,190
hopefully that's clear ok so lets you

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,900
know honestly most video editors

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,420
actually are they're just doing what are

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,740
called EDL's edit decision lists they

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,780
don't need to they don't really care

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,340
what your picture looks like all they

00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,160
want to know is what time code you're at

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,980
or I don't admit it probably gets into

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,770
lower levels of in the codec stuff like

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,960
page slips or something but yeah they

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:20,010
don't care about that all everything

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:25,200
that we see they edit by the numbers so

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:29,950
so I'm i'll take another clip here

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,200
randomly and again it's just I to mark

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,360
your the point where it's good and then

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,880
Oh to mark the point where it stops

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,350
being good and then again the buttons

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,210
that you care about are down here at the

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,370
bottom the two that you need to know

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,280
right now are either replaced or insert

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,750
so I mean if for some reason I don't

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,980
know if we're doing an experimental film

00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,840
or something because it wouldn't really

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,760
make any sense to do this but let's just

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,490
say we want to do this for some reason

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,310
if we want to intercut this guy walking

00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,800
into the church during the fight scene

00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,410
for some reason we could position our

00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,990
little playhead here in our in our edit

00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:08,800
window to wherever we want that to

00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:12,910
happen and then do an insert edit and

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:18,670
sure enough it drops right into place it

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:21,310
drops this walking scene right in the

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,600
middle of the of the fight scene so

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,250
that's obviously I mean you could

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,290
probably kind of have guessed that that

00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,430
was going to do because it's called

00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,680
insert edit

00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,540
and obviously if we did a replace edit

00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,540
it would not do that it would just right

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,790
over right over all the footage you

00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,950
there would be no lengthening of your

00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,230
entire project you're writing over clips

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:49,270
so insert and replace our kind of

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:52,510
self-explanatory I think okay so at some

00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,700
point in your edit actually I'm going to

00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,350
back out of this project and open i

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:02,680
think i have another test project that

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:04,920
has a little bit more sense to it maybe

00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,920
I don't

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,320
No

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,300
who's this

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,390
now that wasn't it either

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,850
okay I guess I'll just keep using my

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,620
really bad example we'll just pretend

00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:59,110
like all of this makes sense these

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:02,020
random cuts at some point during your

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,580
edit I mean the workflow here would be

00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,090
that you would you would continue to

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,649
look at all of your clips and I'm going

00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,240
to look at them as a list instead of big

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:12,940
thumbnails just to make it a little bit

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,290
easier to fit under this screen but you

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,639
would look through all of your Clips you

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,169
would find the good ones that kind of

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,480
makes sense in relation to one another

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:21,070
and you would drop them into your edit

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,869
sequence that's how you edit video

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,889
that's how you tell stories that make

00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:31,780
some semblance of sense at some point

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:33,190
you would have a story that that is the

00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,990
story that you wanted to tell when you

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,109
were making this this video whether it's

00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:41,830
a home movie or whether it's a short

00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:43,389
film that you're working on whatever but

00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,300
it tends to be pretty rough there tends

00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,919
to be edits that don't quite match and

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,230
things like that so you need to kind of

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,830
like even there like let's just say for

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,659
whatever reason we wanted this guided we

00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,880
didn't want so much blank empty screen

00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,560
before he comes onto the screen into

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:04,330
frame right maybe we want to cut more

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:07,720
like we're like right here where he's

00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,859
sort of already into in the frame so at

00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,170
that point you kind of want to start

00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:16,060
working down in your edit in your edit

00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:18,190
window this is usually what people who

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,580
are used to like the more drag and drop

00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:24,430
you kind of editing like Final Cut and

00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,920
stuff like that are used to they they

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,630
like to mess around in their timeline or

00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,780
their edit window a lot more than

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,760
usually they probably should but it's a

00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,310
way of working and and light works lets

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,130
you do that as well so you might not

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:42,490
really be able to see it completely but

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:45,220
as I roll my mouse over the edge of

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:49,090
these clips you can kind of see that the

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:51,460
icon is changing very subtly so over on

00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,430
the left side of this spliced line where

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:56,890
one clip ends and one clip begins the

00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:00,040
there's a little bracket under the arrow

00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,410
that's sort of open on the left side if

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,670
I swap if I cross over the bracket

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,600
switches so that it's open on the right

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,220
side

00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,250
and if I hover over the spliced line

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:14,050
itself the brackets are kind of against

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:16,120
each other so all this is telling you is

00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,190
that if you click right now so that your

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,760
mouse is up on the on the left side of

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:25,290
your rightmost clip then you can grab

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,270
where that clip starts and pull it over

00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,800
in whatever direction you want to so

00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,230
I've just clicked and it kind of lifts

00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:40,420
this clip out of the Edit temporarily

00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:47,400
and now I can move I can move try that

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:47,400
again I should be able to move this clip

00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:59,479
it's totally not working there goes ok

00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:59,479
we were just

00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,659
okay that's really weird i think i'm

00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,659
clicking at the wrong place hold on

00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:23,630
ok

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,800
I think it was doing it right okay so if

00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,890
I click on this clip I should be able to

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,030
move it over until this guy enters the

00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,030
frame a little bit more

00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:52,240
except that it's not really working for

00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,240
me

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,240
try one more time

00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:08,060
okay here we go you see how this is now

00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,830
moving this isn't actually what I wanted

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,140
to do either though this is actually

00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,720
this is lengthening the leftmost video

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,480
clip and shortening the rightmost video

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,040
clip and you can kind of see where one

00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,050
is going to end now and where one is

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,380
going to begin so it's lengthening there

00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:28,280
on the left it's drawing out that fight

00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:31,340
scene and it's shortening this clip over

00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,640
here on the right so that's where I want

00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,560
them to enter right there so I would

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,750
drop it and click outside of it and now

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:48,710
it replaces all of the footage back into

00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:52,820
the Edit and now I have jeez you're

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:54,410
supposed to click there ok now it's

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,830
replaced all the footage back into the

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,830
Edit and

00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,890
my goodness

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,100
and he comes in when I wanted him to

00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,300
come in I'm not really sure why it's not

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,920
doing what I wanted to do though in

00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,870
terms of I didn't really want to

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,340
lengthen this clip but in theory I

00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:25,760
should be able to click on this clip now

00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:30,050
and shorten it back the other way that's

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,940
doing it and so now I've got a much

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:37,040
shorter movie right so now I've got a

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:43,840
quick cut of this of these people of

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,840
this guy coming in now I'm still not out

00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,100
okay

00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,769
I've got a quick clip of him coming in

00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:59,390
and then him entering more or less where

00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:01,489
I said I wanted him to be entering and

00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:05,539
then we cut back inexplicably to the

00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:07,759
fight scene so I don't know I mean

00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:09,950
there's there's a little gray strip

00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:12,589
strip up here that you're supposed to be

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:16,369
able to click on to sort of unto sort of

00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:18,559
get out of this sort of this this move

00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:21,619
action where you can move the clips

00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,779
around and I'm either not seeing the

00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:26,979
strip with from the contrast of this

00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:30,470
screen or this version of light works is

00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:33,829
not doing that very well it's been kind

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,989
of an off-and-on off and on again kind

00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:38,420
of problem with light works lately so I

00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:41,059
don't know if that's just me missing my

00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,039
mark or if it's this version the latest

00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:46,069
version of this copy of light works

00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:49,279
which i think is 1 11 h or something

00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:53,029
like that either way the principle is

00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:54,579
that you click on a one side of the the

00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:57,019
clip and you can either shorten it or

00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:58,309
make it longer whatever you need to do

00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:03,289
to make your edit a little bit more

00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:13,219
smooth um let's see oh and it's still in

00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:14,719
that raised view okay okay so well any

00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:17,210
questions on that so far I mean I think

00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,339
it's pretty basic stuff i mean you

00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:23,660
select your Clips you dump it into your

00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:31,269
edit window and and that's how you edit

00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:34,250
video yeah so any questions about that

00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:40,020
okay

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:45,530
to which one oh it's actually just like

00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,530
tips like if i click on him he should

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:51,300
read shark is not working right now

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,660
usually if you click on that it brings

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,640
up like a tip on on like whatever it's

00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:01,619
supposed to be contextual to what it's

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:07,530
the paperclip but it's not working right

00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:12,510
now okay so yeah and this is this is I

00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:14,220
think 111 dot H so I don't know maybe

00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:16,890
give it two weeks before you try it and

00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,390
see if they if they because this the you

00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,680
I don't know if you can you guys can

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,119
probably see it on the screen you can

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,010
kind of see how it lifts out like that

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,300
right oh maybe they changed it actually

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,250
because now it's doing it when i click

00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,290
on the clips themselves it used to be

00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,740
you had to click on the gray area to

00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:33,089
sort of receipt everything so that might

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,770
be something that they're changing or

00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:40,410
something i'm not sure okay so we've got

00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:44,010
a basic edit here let me just go what

00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:45,390
what time is it like wood 15 more

00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,060
minutes alright so really quickly

00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:53,550
hopefully let me try to show you a

00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,740
little bit of the effect interface just

00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,890
so you can kind of see that that there

00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:02,460
are there are ways to change what you're

00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:05,130
looking at so I've just imported another

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:09,089
clip and I'm going to drag it into my

00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:18,030
real that I or my bin that I want to

00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:20,329
keep okay so here's a clip and let's

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,329
just say

00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:27,850
so I want some of the close-up stuff

00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:31,730
more or less so I'm hitting in and out I

00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:35,680
no.44 my marks and then I'm just going

00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:39,260
to randomly I'll do a replay sedet and

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,910
now it's in my edit it's in my movie so

00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,130
this is the the new clip that I've just

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:50,360
that I've just dropped into my into my

00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:52,150
movie so let's say that it's looking

00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,980
good but I want to make it look better

00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,750
hopefully this is still there so if I

00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,510
click the effects button which is in the

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,640
lower right-hand corner of my of my edit

00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,890
window of my little timeline here if I

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,100
hit the effects window while my playhead

00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:09,890
is positioned over a clip then that

00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,480
brings up and usually just so you know

00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,070
usually all these windows how they're

00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,900
popping up on screen sort of like off

00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,880
the screen that's that's never happened

00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,670
before it's just a byproduct I think of

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,480
the projector it's that's never happened

00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:27,500
on monitor before so it's it's not as

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,330
rough around that edge as it looks so in

00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:33,200
here are a bunch of different kinds of

00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:36,560
effects I always favor color correction

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,720
because I love color correction but

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,860
there are other ones there are fades and

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:45,050
blurs and masks and green screens and I

00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,240
mean just everything that a good video

00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:49,070
editor ought to provide there they're

00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,590
here already I'm sure there will

00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,900
probably be more or later but like right

00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:58,340
now it's a really really full set of

00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:01,610
effects split screens quadruple squid

00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:04,550
split screens flips flops just all kinds

00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:05,960
of stuff so it's I mean it's even though

00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,570
there are little things here and there

00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,950
that don't seem to be exactly polished

00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:16,490
yet it's it's a very mature kind of a

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:18,020
feeling project in in every other way so

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,810
I'm going to just double click on color

00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,180
correction and you might be able to see

00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:25,160
right here in the upper upper region of

00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,920
the of the video file there's a little

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,460
tiny square there now like right up

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,350
there in the corner that means that

00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,390
there's an effect on that on that track

00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,400
so

00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:43,730
and it also helps that it popped up a

00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:45,740
really huge effect window here so I mean

00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,720
if you've ever used a video editor this

00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,130
is really really familiar so you've

00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,760
positioned your playhead on a clip

00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:54,380
you've put an effect on the clip the

00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,960
effect is there it doesn't look like

00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:59,269
anything right now because it hasn't

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,730
changed its at everything set to like

00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:03,849
the defaults null values or whatever so

00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,319
it's not really that big of a deal but

00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:11,029
but you can obviously change stuff and

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:14,869
typically the stuff that you typically

00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:20,599
the stuff that you want to change I have

00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:22,839
no idea what just happened well I was

00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:22,839
weird

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,799
typically what you want to change I'm

00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,670
going to be very careful this time not

00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:46,559
to click something that will break it

00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:49,109
are things like like the oranges the

00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,209
Amber's because that's where the human

00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:53,729
skin tone is so like if you've got mid

00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:57,199
tones that would that would be the human

00:46:53,729 --> 00:47:01,259
skin so you just add a little bit of

00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:03,509
that's never happened before so like I

00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:05,190
say it's in beta normally what would

00:47:03,509 --> 00:47:08,489
happen here is that you would click on

00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:10,949
the color wheel and it would not blank

00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:14,309
everything out and you would be able to

00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:16,349
add things to you would be able to add

00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:19,769
filters and things like that to to your

00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:23,249
to your clip and it feels like it's not

00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:26,430
picking up my mic clicks or something

00:47:23,249 --> 00:47:34,249
I'm not really sure why it's doing that

00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:36,779
but that's really weird yeah okay so

00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:39,180
there's that that this not working today

00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:41,670
but it's been working like every other

00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,890
day that I've used it it's never really

00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:51,859
blanked it out like that that's really

00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:51,859
really weird let's try it one more time

00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,260
I know

00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:15,750
okay I'm not seeing the elite I don't

00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:18,330
really want to do that but ok let's just

00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,340
try it one more time just for kicks yeah

00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:25,170
I don't know ok so the effect isn't

00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:28,740
working today sorry I would maybe maybe

00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:31,820
wait on on downloading this particular

00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:35,750
version of light works sorry ok so

00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:38,160
that's that's the idea of effects

00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:40,470
wherever your playhead is that's where

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,810
your focus is essentially and anything

00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:45,210
that you do to a clip in that case will

00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:49,080
will be done you know to whatever your

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:54,080
playhead is is is focused over so that's

00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:56,850
just kind of that's how that works the

00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,640
the last thing that I probably could get

00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,890
to today right now is just the simplest

00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,120
one is exporting so after you've cut

00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,330
your you know you've spliced all your

00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,280
video clips together maybe you've

00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,350
affected them maybe not depends on how

00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,720
beta you are in your light works

00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,970
instance and then you would click the

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,460
export button which is near the bottom

00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,140
of this toolbar again logically I mean

00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,360
as you can kind of tell its kind of

00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,800
giving you choices in the way that they

00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,930
kind of makes sense and there's a lot of

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,400
other good things to know about and I'll

00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:29,600
try to get to it in a minute if we have

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,160
time but for now exporting is is

00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,890
exporting there aren't that many choices

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,820
which as someone who really loves to

00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:41,850
compress video for fun this is kind of

00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,020
painful to see but right I'm assuming

00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:45,150
again that this is all going to change

00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,310
for the better when the the source code

00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:51,210
is released right now you've got your

00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:54,330
choice of of different formats there's

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,800
not a huge variety you can do an image

00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,620
sequence if you're going to export it

00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,990
out to like blender or something for

00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:02,160
compositing you can do movs mxf so if

00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:06,630
you're going out to like avid or

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:12,140
something wav files which seems like it

00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:14,460
should be up with a AF but i guess not

00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,950
AVCHD you know all the did all these

00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,480
sort of formats that i don't really love

00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:22,190
any of them but there they

00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,020
do your the size typically you don't

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,820
want to change your size usually you

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,070
want to keep it as close to your

00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,620
original as possible so I'm just going

00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,780
to put it as HD 720 because that's 720p

00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,630
I haven't changed my framerate obviously

00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,390
so essentially i'm just i'm just putting

00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,910
I'm outputting pretty much exactly what

00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:46,700
I brought in in movies at 24 frames per

00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:52,520
second at 720p and you can tell it where

00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:55,670
to save the the the file I'll be okay

00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:59,530
with this for now and then you can give

00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:04,420
it a file name or it can give it itself

00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:09,730
it can just name itself 2013 demo and

00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,730
then start and it shouldn't take long

00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,690
yeah as you can see there's not really

00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,060
any compression going on so it's just

00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,070
kind of it's sending everything that is

00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,240
already in the timeline out to its own

00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:24,560
dedicated file and then some apparently

00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,900
and that's probably my fault because I

00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,010
probably extended a clip and then and

00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,010
then retracted it

00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,310
I don't know why that's still spinning

00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,310
it says it's complete

00:51:53,020 --> 00:52:04,640
quite possibly the export function could

00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:07,099
be not working right now either okay so

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:11,000
that's light works its beta it's a beta

00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:14,859
project feel free to download it and

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,210
test it out give the share guys feedback

00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:21,619
tell them about problems as you come

00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:24,049
across them I have and it has been it's

00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:25,880
been it's felt very open source like

00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:27,890
it's been very good responses it's been

00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,930
like hey this is happening on my

00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,450
computer here's what I'm running and

00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,099
then like in two days they'll have a new

00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:38,349
beta release out that fixes your problem

00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:41,359
so they've been really really responsive

00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:43,970
overall I get a pretty good feeling from

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,740
from the projects I would I would I

00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,599
think I would feel a lot more secure if

00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,760
there was source code out there that

00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,890
that way i would just know that it's

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,930
there but right now it's it's being

00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,150
developed a lot it's they're working

00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:58,460
really hard on it so if you're

00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,369
interested beta test it it's an open

00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:04,369
beta right now just go download it use

00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:08,510
it and report errors and they will they

00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:11,440
will fix them any questions if I can get

00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,440
this thing to respond

00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:20,770
yeah i mean honestly it seems very very

00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:24,790
much of of the time right now like i

00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:27,070
haven't I mean we use fairly modern

00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:29,920
cameras at the school where I work and

00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:34,180
I've just imported stuff it's been a

00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,010
no-brainer so yeah I mean I mean it

00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,840
actually that's not true it hasn't been

00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,220
a no brainer it seats well it has been a

00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,380
no-brainer as long as i'm importing

00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:45,130
files from those cameras if its files

00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:47,200
from elsewhere then then sometimes it

00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,970
does screw me over because there's not a

00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,300
whole lot of support it's like it's

00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:53,890
almost got to be like a modern camera or

00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,630
maybe you know a three year old camera

00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:58,960
like that's that's kind of a window of

00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:01,210
opportunity if it's even SD mini DV I

00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,740
don't even know like I haven't I haven't

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,320
actually tested it but i'm not sure like

00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,060
it it's it's pretty limited in its

00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:10,440
support right now but I'm again I'm

00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,440
assuming that that's going to change so

00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,220
any other questions

00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:44,850
well not not directly because that's not

00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:47,040
really how it's done usually like I mean

00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,720
yes and no like what what i would do is

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,590
like if i was working on something in

00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,600
light works that required compositing

00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:57,510
typically you just take you just take

00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,040
the clip that you need which i would

00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,780
show you you but as long as your

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,850
playhead is over a clip then you can

00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,940
just export that one clip you would mark

00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:07,380
that clip as an in-and-out in your edit

00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,030
just like you do for a viewer with the

00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,550
eye and the 0 button really wish I could

00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:15,870
show you that right now I have a feeling

00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:17,160
well anyway you would mark it in and out

00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:19,680
and you could even do it with these

00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,800
buttons and you would you would export

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,150
that clip as an image sequence because

00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,480
that's what blender really wants to see

00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:29,370
anyway it doesn't like video it likes

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,860
images so I would export it like as full

00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:33,780
quality either Targa or tiff files and

00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,390
then import that whole folder into

00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:38,700
blender do your compositing export it

00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,620
back out into light we're back out to

00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,510
your hard drive and then import those

00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,630
composited files back into light works

00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:48,660
that's actually with the one notable

00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:51,090
exception of like after works after

00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,580
effects and premier like every other

00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:55,710
like the every other application I've

00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:57,450
ever heard of does it that way it

00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:59,430
doesn't do an internal round-tripping

00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:01,200
like after effects on premiere does you

00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,690
export it as an image sequence you

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,440
either hand it to your your compositor

00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:09,360
or you drive over to the compositing

00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,310
house you know two blocks away you give

00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,920
it to them they do their magic and they

00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:17,220
give you the files back so that's that's

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,160
normal I haven't really done it because

00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:23,160
I'm not a compositor but I mean I don't

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,420
see why it wouldn't work other than the

00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,210
fact that i'm at a spinning wheel right

00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,010
now from just having exported but i mean

00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,950
like once it's all smooth doubt it ought

00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:34,340
to be pretty transparent any other

00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,340
questions

00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:42,319
what is the red supposed to quit oh it

00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:45,020
just gives you like tips on how to use

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,980
it it like says you know like did you

00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:50,480
know that if you yeah totally I don't

00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,740
know if there was like a historical

00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,450
reason for that I don't know where the

00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:58,579
red shark came from but it's there and

00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:01,900
it's not working anyway so yeah that's

00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:01,900
it thanks for attending

00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:52,410
most enterprises today realize that

00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,029
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:56,400
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:58,470
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,509
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:02,640
popular lately that adds that extra

00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:05,309
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,049
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:09,269
know is that some two-factor

00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:11,490
authentication solutions they're better

00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:14,519
than others like two-factor strong

00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:16,799
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:18,749
beyond other authentication systems by

00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,809
being less expensive easier to implement

00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:24,299
and easier to use giving software-based

00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:27,150
token clients built to run on all major

00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:29,749
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:32,069
Android these tokens utilize a

00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:34,499
public/private key combination that's

00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:36,450
generated and on device so there are any

00:58:34,499 --> 00:58:38,970
shared secrets flying around for

00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:41,819
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,680
special handling instead all keys are

00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:46,140
kept secure and private between the

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,329
requesting token and your server which

00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,970
you control in house making it the most

00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:52,650
secure way possible to perform

00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:55,440
authentication encryption and with an

00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:58,230
extensive flexible API and support for

00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,210
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,390
works with any enterprise network

00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:04,089
architecture to protect the IT

00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:06,700

regardless of whether you're considering

00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:12,260
two-factor authentication for the first

00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,650
time we're just ready to ditch your

00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:18,140
existing expensive key fob system we can

00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:22,839
help with easy to implement easy to use

00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,839
strong authentication from wicked

00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:33,920
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:36,109
way to better utilize all your resources

00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,560
and it makes managing all your resources

00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:43,390
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:46,910
happening in open source the

00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,680
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:50,630
of the community and then the speed at

00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,520
which these are these you know these

00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,680
these deficiencies these bugs are

00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:57,050
getting discovered and then fixed is it

00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,410
I think that really shows the power of

00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:02,060
the of the open source community it is

01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:06,260
global and it's definitely because of

01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:12,590
the users community people are extremely

01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:14,480
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:16,760
go on tire see any day you'll see these

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,490
guys helping each other out and they're

01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,200
all doing it like in a selfless manner

01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:24,190
the product is transparent for everyone

01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,380
everyone can look at the code base

01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:29,590
everyone can see how close duck is being

01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:35,119
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:37,790
everything is open in many ways it's

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:42,200
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:46,400
health CloudStack the most exciting

01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:49,250
event in recent memory for me was our

01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,890
first developer boot camp

01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:54,530
and our call gave people a gave me two

01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:58,370
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:00:54,530 --> 01:01:02,660
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:05,510
up with 87 people and had to go get more

01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:08,030
chairs into the room twice everything

01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:11,300
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:14,360
is open source and so I don't think that

01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:16,100
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:19,130
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:21,860
computing and so i think it's i think

01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:23,210
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,320
about cloud computing you're really

01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:29,870
talking about open source cloud

01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:33,020
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:35,420
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:39,320
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:41,990
each data centers these hardware is

01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:45,500
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:48,200
to handle number one that mass scale

01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:51,350
number two it's designed to handle the

01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:54,230
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:58,430
deployments started working on contact

01:01:54,230 --> 01:02:01,700
over four years ago and it was the

01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:03,470
original set of people working on it had

01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:07,580
a background of delivering software

01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:11,810
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:15,440
lots of users actually using it high

01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:18,500
availability is the key feature multiple

01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,690
hypervisors support different network

01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:23,690
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:25,460
better while step management server can

01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:29,150
be deployed in different physical

01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:30,800
machines it definitely has a huge

01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:35,810
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:38,390
there's a major movie studio that they

01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:41,810
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:44,000
to transmit video and I thought that was

01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:45,290
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,560
fascinating is what they did during

01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:51,350
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,730
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,349
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:56,589
the instance

01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:59,140
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

01:02:56,589 --> 01:03:00,999
vast it touches so many different

01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,799
aspects and there's no one person that's

01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:06,190
kind of like a master of all those

01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:09,339
realms I think CloudStack as a project

01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:11,619
is going to be one of the leaders simply

01:03:09,339 --> 01:03:16,690
because it's some of the most feature

01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:20,769
Follin and and robust platforms out they

01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:23,309
were Adam senior living through the

01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:23,309
clouds dag

01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,220
you

01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:46,559
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,539
ago we could not have imagined that

01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,730
asterisk would not only become the most

01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:52,859
widely adopted open source communication

01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:54,900
software on the planet but that it would

01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:57,420
impact the entire industry in the way

01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,400
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,039
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,990
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,089
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,500
transition of power from the hands of

01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:09,750
the traditional proprietary phone

01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,150
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:14,099
administrators of phone systems using

01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:15,329
this power our customers have created

01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:17,279
all sorts of business changing

01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:19,109
applications from small office phone

01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:21,630
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:23,250
the international carrier networks in

01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,020
fact there's even an entire country

01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:27,420
those communications of a structure runs

01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,549
on esters the gym has always been about

01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,260
creating technology that expands

01:04:29,549 --> 01:04:33,420
communications capabilities in ways that

01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,799
we could never have imagined and that's

01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,440
part of what's game-changing about the

01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:39,900
gym today we're doing it again this time

01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,000
by introducing a new family of HD IP

01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,309
phones that extends control of the user

01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,049
all the way to the desktop the launch of

01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:47,569
these new products represents the next

01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:50,220
phase indigenous history of innovation

01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:52,170
these are the first and only IP phones

01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,760
designed to fully leverage the power of

01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,380
estrus when we first discussed our

01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,180
expectations for building a family of

01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:59,339
phones for use with asterisk our

01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,079
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:02,700
the team to build the phones such that

01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,920
they were easy to install integrate

01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,750
provision in use I think you'll soon

01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,329
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:10,950
that goal user feedback is validating

01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:13,079
that when it comes to operation with

01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:15,510
astro space systems including our own

01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:18,059
Switchvox based product these are the

01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,380
easiest to use best integrated most

01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,960
interoperable products on the market

01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:23,960
today the digitally phones will

01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,010
initially include three IP des hommes

01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,960
uniquely designed to complement any

01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:29,819
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,490
these phones are different for a number

01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:35,160
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:36,569
designed for use with esters secondly

01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,180
we've made it really easy to

01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:40,589
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:42,660
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:05:40,589 --> 01:05:44,609
to access information inside of asterisk

01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:46,220
allowing tight coupling between an

01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:48,210
application and the

01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,340
additionally we've created an

01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:52,470
applications engine that allows users

01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,710
and developers to create and run their

01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:57,480
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:59,430
done all of this at a very compelling

01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,110
price point at Digium we're always

01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:03,210
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:05,790
the best value in business phone systems

01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:07,320
and also give them the power to create

01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:09,480
their own solutions or any

01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,190
communications challenge will continue

01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,600
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:14,670
Astra's cooler faster more

01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,290
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:18,780
asterisk and what communications even

01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:22,490
easier and together we'll change the way

01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,490
the world communicates again

01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:34,050
your customers rely on your website or

01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:36,450
application if it's slower

01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:39,390
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:41,190
and costs you money keeping your

01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:44,700
business critical systems humming along

01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:47,520
requires insight into what they're doing

01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,530
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,780
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:54,089
resource limitations and other problems

01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,859
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:06:54,089 --> 01:06:58,470
your systems performance metrics in

01:06:55,859 --> 01:07:01,320
real-time and record this data for later

01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:03,300
analysis enter longview the new way to

01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,310
see what's really going on under the

01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,440
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,450
visualize the status of all your systems

01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,180
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:15,300
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:17,760
memory swap processes load and network

01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:20,339
usage click a specific system to access

01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,320
its individual dashboard then click and

01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:25,320
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:27,329
more detail comprehensive network data

01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:30,030
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:07:27,329 --> 01:07:31,589
is available on the network tab and disk

01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:33,510
rights and free space on the disk

01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:36,359
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:38,880
displays usage statistics for individual

01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:41,070
processes the system info tab shows

01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,320
listening services active connections

01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:45,450
and available updates adding long view

01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,130
to a system is easy just click the

01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:49,290
button copy the one line installation

01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:51,720
command then run the command on your

01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:53,430
linux system to complete the process the

01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,619
agent will begin collecting data and

01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:57,440
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:07:55,619 --> 01:08:00,020
start rolling

01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,390
use longview to gain visibility into

01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:06,130
your servers so when your website or app

01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:06,130
