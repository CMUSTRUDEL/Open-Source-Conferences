or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:32,009
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:38,460
possible ok welcome everyone to my talk

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:43,739
today introducing ria db10 Who am I my

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,780
name is Daniel Bartholomew I am a senior

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,200
technical writer insisted min for the

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,000
Maria DB project I am NOT one of the

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,449
Maria DB developers I help the

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,030
developers with their infrastructure

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,949
needs and I work on the documentation

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,680
for Maria DB so if you have any

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,460
questions that delve into the code I'm

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
not the one you want to talk to and I'm

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,350
also not the one you want to talk to if

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,909
you want to troubleshoot your database

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:18,509
just it's not what I do you can contact

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,450
me d bar tab maria DB org i'm also on

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,420
freenode I hang out in the pound Maria

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,500
channel mostly I occasionally dip into

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,020
the trial ugh channel and other channels

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,090
but hang out on there i'm on twitter

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,150
daniel Bart i'm on google+ i am also on

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,280
facebook but not if i can help it I do

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,259
have an account mainly because we have a

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,500
Facebook page that's really popular and

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,509
so the only times I log into Facebook is

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,070
when I need to post something to our

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,640
stream the RIA DB stream on facebook so

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,430
okay so what is Maria TV most of you are

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,509
probably familiar with what Maria DB is

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:05,399
it started as a branch of MySQL it was

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,350
started back in two thousand nine so

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,350
it's about 50 months old at this point

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,360
we've had several major releases we

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,350
started out with 51 release and then we

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,290
did a 52 53 55 we did a galera cluster

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,810
release and now the developers are

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,120
working on Rio db10 which is currently

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:31,130
in alpha our tagline that we that we've

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,200
used is community developed feature

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,610
enhanced and backwards compatible so if

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,740
you want more information about what

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,310
maria DB is right now the shipping

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,250
stable version you should attend max's

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:51,020
methods talk he's going to be speaking

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,440
about maria DB as it is right now yeah

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,860
tomorrow 9am this same room according to

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,360
the schedule so that'll that'll be a

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:05,390
great talk encourage you all to attend

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:09,670
that ok so why are we jumping from Maria

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:12,050
DB 55 all the way to Maria DB version 10

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:16,760
we've written several blog posts about

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,980
them that I put thy putting the links

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,110
i'll be putting links throughout the

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,390
presentation I don't expect you to

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,160
spiritually scribble them at so that if

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,870
you download the presentation later from

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:32,090
the self website you'll be able to have

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:35,120
them there anyway these blog posts kind

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:42,110
of go through some of the whats whys and

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:47,720
wherefores of it but in basically Maria

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:52,940
DB 51 Maria DB 55 our version locked

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:58,519
with MySQL we can't release say MySQL

00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:00,739
I'm Maria db5 dot 532 until MySQL

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,480
releases five dot five about 32 then we

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:07,760
pull in then we can pull in their stuff

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,380
and release our version so the version

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,170
walking that that has always caused

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,480
problems when we had when we did our 52

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,419
and 53 releases we could introduce

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,910
things we could fix things as fast as we

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,240
wanted to because we weren't tied to the

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,310
MySQL version numbering

00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,330
so that in 52 and 53 that was really

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:31,690
good but 5 155 were locked so for

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,690
example this was this is an example that

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:39,340
I remember very well this was probably a

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,730
couple years ago in Maria DB and mysql

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,920
version five dot one dot 44 one of our

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:49,090
developers found a buffer overflow it

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:54,010
was a really really bad bug and they he

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:56,650
discovered that it was very easy to to

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,500
get elevated privileges using this

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,630
buffer overflow attack you know it's

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,370
priority one you need to fix this right

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:09,010
now so we did we we fixed it immediately

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,920
it out it only took us hours to get it

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,240
into the source code up on launch pad

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,390
and then the package releases in a

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,680
couple of days the package release you

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,320
know that's just because you have to

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,230
build it on like 10 different platforms

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,780
and seed the mirrors and all that so but

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,770
tried to get out as fast as we could the

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,900
only problem was it was 51 dot 40 45 dot

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,700
one dot 45 of my spell is not out yet so

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,310
what do we do what do we call it this is

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,340
not something we're going to wait for we

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:43,720
have to get it so we called it five dot

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,660
one dot 44 b and then a few days a few

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,280
days later mysql fixed the same bug but

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,229
they came out with five dot one dot 45

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,240
but we have five dot one dot 44 so

00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:54,160
what's the first thing that people ask

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,710
us well i heard there was a really

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,940
serious bug in mysql five dot one dot 44

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,070
and they just released five dot one dot

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,130
45 why don't you have five dot one dot

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,310
45 with this important very serious bug

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,410
fix in it well this is like we do and we

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,320
had it like a week before they did but

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,800
we couldn't call it five dot one at 45

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:22,960
so we called it five dot one dot 44b

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:25,600
that's not ideal excuse me so five dot

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,030
as i said before 52 and 53 were much

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,650
easier to manage because we didn't have

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,710
to wait we didn't have to use

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:39,230
non-standard version numbers also

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:41,580
we had huge changes in five dot 3 and so

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,830
the first thing that people asked us

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,420
when we released five dot three was when

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,960
are you going to have five dot five out

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,760
and we're like well five dot 3 is really

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,260
big we have all sorts of awesome

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,270
features in here that you're not going

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,070
to find anywhere else but they've said

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,440
well yeah that's cool but I want five

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,580
dot five because my skull has five dot

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,890
five and we want five dot five but it's

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,290
not the the five dot three changes were

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,290
so we we did a lot of changes to the

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,060
optimizer very deep into the optimizer

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,600
the core of the server the thing that

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,460
takes all your SQL code and translates

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,470
it actually does all the Quarian and

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,900
gives you your answer back we did a lot

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,330
of really deep changes to that so

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,400
merging the two took a long time and

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:31,740
people didn't like that wait just just

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,590
as an example you really be five dot

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,560
five it's the difference between rio to

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,570
be five to five and mysql 5 f-5 it's

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,780
about one and a half million lines of

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,960
extra code if if it was a diff it would

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,840
be about 61 megabytes the only thing is

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,940
it's not a diff there's no there's no

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,150
Maria DB patchset that you can just

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,900
apply to the MySQL source code the

00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:01,590
changes are that it's it's too deep of a

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,470
difference and so you know you go

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,640
feature by feature we are very careful

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:10,070
to make sure that their binary

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:19,980
compatible that the syntax is the same

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:22,350
but there's differences and so also so

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,300
so you have differences you have version

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:30,570
numbering issues there's also features

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,790
we're db5 dot five and five dot 3 and

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:37,140
even five dot to introduce features that

00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:39,840
are only now appearing in MySQL 56 so

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,340
we're playing this kind of leapfrog game

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,350
where we move something forward they

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:56,600
move they move from before their remove

00:08:43,350 --> 00:09:00,750
targets okay and so we it's already hard

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,120
when you say okay we have a guarantee

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,740
that for the same version number Maria

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,720
DB 55 mysql 55 you can move from mysql

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,060
552 really big high five without any

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,560
configuration changes without having to

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,150
do anything to your data files it will

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,890
read the data files that we read your

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,050
configuration files your apps will be

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,560
able to talk to it out of the box no

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,560
changes

00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:43,410
taking advantage of the reasons why you

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,560
want you may be impersonal as changes

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,600
are taking advantage of those options

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,310
use you suddenly really be something

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,050
very different than my spell pipeline

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:58,519
another issue that the developers ran

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:01,110
into particularly with MySQL 56 is

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,610
someone had horrible decide for getting

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:08,459
that idea to be back open it which

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,339
program is likely that that's fine the

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,940
only problem is were not using a version

00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:18,920
control system that can track function

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,680
but it's moved from by the time you get

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,449
in particular where usual bizarre which

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:30,420
is on launch pad the search for that now

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:35,209
and so what is what's that you is a huge

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,459
losses from from my skill

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:42,200
because they move things around they

00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:44,180
reorganize the Codex our developers

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,770
what I saw that big decision to know

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,750
that the commit history all the verses

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,910
burdening and everything is too

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,810
important we don't want to lose that so

00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:00,320
as we implement 506 features you have to

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,230
take them and move them back one by one

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,990
and so that that fascination with black

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,670
on six and a reason why we're not we're

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,530
not i'm going to go to repd 5s there's

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,220
also an issue of some of the code that's

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:19,190
in five got six our developers know like

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,990
they don't like for whatever reason i

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,110
like i said

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,240
why is why they think it's not good

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,339
enough but they'll take they'll take a

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,860
feature and say okay I like the idea

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,560
behind this feature but I don't like the

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,440
way they did they did it they did it

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,760
this way but if you do it this way that

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,830
these two this problem so we're not

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,600
going to it that way working we need to

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,620
do it properly too good right you see

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,260
them this way and so just because it's

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:52,630
in my cell 506 doesn't mean that we can

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:58,520
just grab it and use it out of box also

00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:01,040
there are recent test cases any bug fix

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,709
that goes into Korea TV the standard is

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,430
it must have a company testing there

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:09,800
must be a test that trickster bug and so

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,860
you can test since before I fly the code

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,010
is test case fails after you fire code

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,350
this test take this test case acid bug

00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:23,800
fixes in my scale don't always come with

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:26,570
test cases some do some don't and so

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,810
before we can put it in for developers

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:33,320
will put a patch from life well and good

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,760
for you they have write a test case now

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,690
sometimes they can get that from the bug

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,259
reporter but there are non-public bug

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:45,339
report

00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:48,610
they work Liz said that it you just have

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:50,439
to ask to get access to to their to

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,809
their number of the clock databases for

00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:57,639
developers friday or not let me that's

00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,889
also for the reasons that that

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,860
distributions have have given regarding

00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:06,910
that very reason why they're switching

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:09,809
to really be with their is because of

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,639
these non-public these these other

00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:14,639
databases are they have customer

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,580
and we're very strong believer that all

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,899
of the bug database you completely over

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,499
it's not a vengeance

00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:28,360
users even if you know especially if

00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:31,689
it's like a security bug you know you

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,850
need to know what what but is what the

00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:35,980
code is that fixes it I mean we

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,339
practically new best practices because

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:43,119
we have a list for the early disclosure

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,939
of bugs and you know just just like my

00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,529
industry where we let the people who

00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:50,529
need to know packages for the

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,449
distribution the developers were working

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,490
on with it so they know what exactly it

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,470
is they can get fixed but as soon as

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,529
that is released then that becomes over

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,420
this like it should and then we have not

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:07,329
we have not seen the same level of

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:09,119
openness before and so just to recap why

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:13,449
are we moving why are we changing

00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:16,059
instead of following our personal I I

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:19,240
think through this if 12 out of 14

00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:23,290
minutes we have two more flexibility we

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,730
want to be able to release bug fixes on

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:31,170
our own timetable

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:34,140
we want to be able to release new

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,060
features new enhancements without having

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,710
the way but when they're ready to be

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,600
released won't be able to release them

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,810
when when something's been approved and

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,370
ready for why use we want to be able to

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,980
release it so the flexibility is very

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,370
important all is also very important we

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:54,020
want we don't want to compromise at all

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:58,860
ever you must be able to innovate

00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,870
without constant questions both you know

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,640
your version numbering doesn't match

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,790
their version numbering it's just like

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,770
oh you're right you know you might go on

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,220
this person we're on this version that's

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,600
the way it is in practice so that's the

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,070
way we're actually going to number it

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,060
now instead of being I've never

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,630
numbering and all the bottoms of that so

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,910
basically it we want to reflect me out

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,990
way things are really has advanced so

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:30,080
far that is time to

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:40,580
ring and new bigger head with an extra

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:42,709
number so greedy 10 releases we had a 3d

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:47,120
single part of our first alcohol was

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:52,130
having in November 2012 we got second

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:55,550
outfit temporary third up April for

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:59,690
alpha should be coming behind paint next

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,850
week I'm not sure last night I caught

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,449
the developers on Tuesday they were

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,959
shooting for next week dependent on you

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,970
know whether or not sort of things ready

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,300
why we're kind of all alphas because ten

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:16,819
ten dollars not to get injured complete

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:20,390
as soon as me as soon as we release the

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,419
beta this it's locked that all the

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,689
features that we want

00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:27,129
I will be innovative and so there's some

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,739
features in senator push you to the

00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,149
source PFF isn't already and so that's

00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:33,070
why we're going to keep calling it out

00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,840
and tell all the feature to them and

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,600
will call in a to the bottom of it

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,450
releases a couple for these candidate

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,700
reduces and it finally single sometime

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:48,159
like summer is what I finger shoot to

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:59,019
get the stable first now but making good

00:17:48,159 --> 00:18:03,639
progress so really you can diminish bill

00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:08,109
number 85 we should really go see the

00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:12,190
next praxis top it includes backward

00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:14,320
pl/sql some some some future my stuff I

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,529
sex and users backward you just take

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,809
another and put it directly into Brady

00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:23,649
we also include 30 many features that we

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:28,239
think are great ideas but we want to for

00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:31,869
one reason or another we need to redo

00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:33,920
them or Beltre still need to do think

00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:37,010
that if I spent me doing

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,960
or the support that and then we have

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:48,070
really a lot just like you have a lot of

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:51,860
duty 2 3 d 5 so that quarter features

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:54,680
what are those well first thing is we

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,740
become classics the complete Adobe much

00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,220
we've always made them the upstream no

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,290
DB has is mainly because it's experts

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,660
it's an excellent it's next door storage

00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:08,480
engine so any any of the features that

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,150
you may work out in myself I sex in

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,390
their building east norriton will have

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:17,420
because we'll have a full energy storage

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:23,360
will also the including bonus extra TV

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:26,840
started later with that or Maria me 5155

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,300
we actually we actually had extra TV as

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,050
the default ordinal TV so if you said

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,559
you know use a no TV for the for the

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:37,710
table type who acts

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:42,559
actually but but in our testing we found

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:45,779
that the nodd in questo 56 is faster

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:56,539
it's better than extra TV at this time

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:56,539
so right now they will be from second

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,110
turn about that it's a way to do low

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,810
level monitoring the per server

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:08,070
performance characteristics so you can

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:09,360
better analyze and see where you can

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,160
improve your performance of your

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,690
database so that passing that's back

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,520
when 4506 all my ultra table it have

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,710
been that track coordinates away so that

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,710
you don't have to lock your tables

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:30,830
do it online love that and so backward

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:34,430
that for five essays so the operator

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:37,640
changes we have done specifically the

00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:39,440
order by clinical optimization which can

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:46,210
show which we can use to show me a few

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,210
rolls of quarters so step backward and

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:57,050
reimplemented features stuff mean that

00:20:51,410 --> 00:21:01,640
we've we have something to take a prize

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:04,130
for bicycle we be good those include the

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,320
error messages with the system very

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,910
strange so that you know improves the

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,670
error messages so it's easier to figure

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,650
out what is actually saying and what the

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:16,130
actual problem is so we take those

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:19,030
include air isn't coming we reinvented

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,030
it from

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,760
the current timestamp is default for a

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,820
time huh eight nine columns on this

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,710
device feature if you never when you

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,740
update a row to database you want to

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,350
update the state ID column the current

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,150
times that automatically you used to be

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,270
able to do that but only with columns

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,580
that were kind of calls that were tight

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,680
I mean you're going to upon the Rope

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:50,180
tight tight then you can do it with comp

00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:54,650
that broke a date time and I nice

00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:59,360
feature 56 we rented

00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:03,910
and also the gold rat actually I need

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:07,940
this with a feature of introducing 56

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:10,220
but we've had us in 3d b-52 so for

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,170
obvious reasons we couldn't just take

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,280
their version because we already had our

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:18,620
own version and sewing in 10 we have

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,350
gone through and try to make it was me

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,450
that as you can so that you can use the

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,040
goal transaction ideas and more

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:30,230
information on this feature you could go

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:34,160
there from knowledge base the ultra that

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,380
ID feature is very nice for for when you

00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,210
have multiple servers and you're doing

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,690
all sorts of transactional trying to

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:46,340
make sure that the binary button down of

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:49,010
the order it all have parallel

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,430
replication that's a feature five six of

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,490
you be implemented

00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:59,110
I can't speak to I just know it's there

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:02,020
and the formation of this really we got

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:09,130
a blessing about that that's our gear

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:11,290
it's art it's our bug and we're so but

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,120
what of development equation all the

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,330
development phase well above the person

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,000
gets put into that and then that is the

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,610
task for applications that work details

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,340
about the implementation over what is

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:28,840
our behind that okay that's not about

00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:35,500
some of the new features that are in

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:38,950
really 10 first up we have our

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,220
multi-source replication discussed on a

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:51,070
feature from originally developed by a

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:56,410
cow application the basic idea behind it

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:59,310
is replicating you have applications

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,180
Master and you're going to many slaves

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,240
well what if you have your data

00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,880
partition and so you have all these

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,890
masters and have this partition data but

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,640
you want to do say backups or you want

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,530
to do analytics or something because the

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,200
main reason uniting precision in your

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,000
data speed right or you want to have so

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,110
that it can go out and wrap the

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,960
information within just a couple

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:26,950
milliseconds you know I check websites

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,530
very important is the plan for travel

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,330
whatever reason you need to speak and so

00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,920
you have all these partitions but what

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,269
if you want well I need to back it all

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,279
up or I need to do brunch

00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:40,559
where's where I don't really really

00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:44,309
issue but he owes for me having a box

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:48,509
well now with this you can take all

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:56,399
those over back single slavers pulling

00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:59,839
for multiple that so kind of a very like

00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:09,539
that and more information on that

00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:16,309
they're all right other features the

00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:16,309
exists to in optimization I'll be on

00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:27,719
more informations there Monty was really

00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:29,490
excited about it and yeah that's all I

00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:33,900
can say about

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,350
in a short span the thread i need to get

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:48,450
the great plan for a running stable

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:52,440
feature that we have in there okay we

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:56,880
improve alter table for the aria and why

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,160
I some storage engines just made them

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,390
faster you're not familiar with Aria

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:05,070
Aria it's basically a crash safe my Isom

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,679
so this is not transaction or anything

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,260
but for those for those you know if

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,730
you're using my I some now and you just

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,820
need something that's a little bit more

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,220
robust you know it basically acts like

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:23,309
my son has the benefits of my eyes on

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:24,210
your speed but arias crash take that and

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,450
so

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:31,850
that's nice anyway we group the table so

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:34,260
that it's much faster we also have a

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:38,760
perfect memory usage is another feature

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:42,090
from taobao so that you can see about

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,400
memories memory usage is basically you

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,500
look up information schema process less

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,660
the better part was there syntheses

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,710
never use it and the roads are being

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:56,060
examined and when you do a show status

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,060
and we'll show them enough

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:02,630
see how that are better get a few having

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:06,780
that basis is performing to reply stop

00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:12,720
information for that is there and audio

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:14,490
level all right another new feature that

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,370
is kind of cool is the engine

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:22,250
independent resistant statistics one of

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,250
the nice cool new features

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:31,920
six was persistent statistics statistics

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:37,770
are used when a when you're going to

00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:39,870
wearing a table the author I domestic

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,270
use the query one has to do well how am

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,090
I going to get the data or Gavin today

00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,830
and it tries to choose the one that will

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:52,800
get you the correct results too fast but

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:54,450
without without a way of knowing that

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,030
waiter Academy of some sort of

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,950
statistics about that about the table it

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:03,480
happening just has to guess at what it

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,730
thinks will be the bestest and so a nice

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,770
cup by six they do have this participer

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:11,160
system suggesting stores a little bit of

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:13,500
information about the table and then use

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,620
that to to the Vedic very French use a

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,200
plan that is usual faster in a more fun

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,360
way sometimes you can get it without

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,760
having sex estimated by just using the

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,410
indexes you know very good to use with

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,429
various options to try to get you your

00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,440
data

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:31,490
and so the resistances were great in

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,720
westville by six there only four

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,400
and so we implanted one that was

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:43,670
entering a pendant but they're using a

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:45,110
no TV or my I say or one of the

00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:49,400
alternative storage engines like

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:54,920
federated core or spider soccer whatever

00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:58,070
the dissidents retweet gather statistics

00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:00,830
and ended in a generic way which was

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:03,740
less you which benefits every storage

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,929
engine it doesn't business Aaron a few

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,929
minutes who supports persistent

00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:15,650
statistics we can we can just do it

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:18,350
random yeah so so as I said it's used by

00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:20,450
the by the database to choose the best

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:26,809
execution plan for up for a risk you'll

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:28,850
see the plan networks the best and

00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:32,050
install selected for London deck

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,050
scholars like

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:41,570
so so we actually proved only in

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:44,840
metaphysics in my scope I said the

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:48,920
addition to expanding into all storage

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:56,560
just find out more information about

00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:58,820
this five if you wanted to also look at

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,760
one of our belt eight o'clock of the

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:07,280
user conferences slides are online work

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:11,830
on the cold live and in santa clara that

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,830
bagel in talk just his name

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,760
in addition to the

00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:27,169
all right another thing we've been doing

00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:30,799
we've been working along with partners

00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:33,329
other companies and one of those is

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,969
fusion-io if you're not familiar with

00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:41,009
them thank you high speed cash flash

00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:43,949
storage for flash basically changed

00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:46,619
everything in that a space and so we

00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:53,099
added support for atomic rights on

00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:58,619
fusion-io direct FS green I like this

00:30:53,099 --> 00:31:00,419
one is like running who are you have

00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,279
transaction driving that trans actually

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:06,239
because you want you want your data to

00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:09,479
to be safe 28 data to get to the disk

00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:11,999
when you want to get for this and you so

00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:16,019
there's a few methods that can use to do

00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:19,079
that right you have when you're using

00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:22,409
spinning platters you how do you make

00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:26,219
sure the data is on this and safely well

00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:29,460
you the primary method of doing that is

00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:32,850
right right been walking right

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,419
and in wearing the file system hasn't

00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:38,610
been written and you just hope the

00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:40,559
classes whose life because they often do

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,029
because they have my cash back to store

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,190
if you stuff and so they'll say well

00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:47,570
it's great to put an extra bowl of the

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:51,000
female sex that usually we're son but

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,390
our avid readers like whatever it can

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,409
you can follow while we work closely

00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:02,220
with with fusion-io because in a flash

00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:07,080
face it things are different when you're

00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:10,200
going to dollars writing this where the

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,330
flash forward and so you want to avoid

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,610
unnecessary rights if you don't have to

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:20,010
go and so using multiple rights to try

00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:24,870
to get you try to shorten the day it

00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:28,799
written like this last bite you can

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:32,010
avoid that that's great so they they

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,540
provide us with with some help to a

00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,309
feature of there

00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:40,190
right and what it says it's written you

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:42,080
knows what they absolutely guaranteed

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:46,070
the trip to their to their flash cards

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,990
right we for the future we have you

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,540
tonight earth because they were working

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:53,060
there are other flat vendors out there

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:56,990
we want to expand it to everyone else

00:32:53,060 --> 00:33:00,830
but fusion-io personal step horses ever

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:03,530
want to get the future so the more

00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,450
information these police places if you

00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:10,550
are the knowledge mr. confusion i hope

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:15,110
you'll find it we also feel fitted a

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:18,320
better table discovery for veteran x so

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:20,540
that it can better get it better it is

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,650
is its own kind of animal where it's

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,510
where it's taking and talking to other

00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:28,730
databases otherwise don't maybe

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:32,840
databases on the persistent if they were

00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:35,570
local so it's it this helps to improve

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,880
that so you know you know the original

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,230
better engine is totally unsupported

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,169
totally on

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:53,260
next we're still trying to improve that

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:57,230
in some countries and after that the

00:33:53,260 --> 00:34:02,049
best new feature i think is ingredient

00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:04,780
edison i personally is transition to

00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:09,020
really be using really as a data

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:11,300
platform as you know there's a lot of

00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,950
database of them you have you have the

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,919
traditional relational database world

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:29,270
oracle and so on and then you also have

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:31,220
the knowest will seal the JSON schema

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,429
lists all that all that sort of thing

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,190
and we thought for a while that you know

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,710
our goal are not that much different is

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,179
going bad in different ways and so why

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,600
should you have to completely change

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,520
your tools simply because you're using a

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,690
different data store and so one of the

00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,169
other things that we're doing

00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:53,899
that is when we're coming out with

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:56,000
Cassandra storage now what this does is

00:34:53,899 --> 00:35:00,380
it lets you talk to make his hand

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,420
storage engine as if it was you know

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,130
just another Georgian there's some

00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,780
limitation of course we miss cassandra

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:12,020
is very different from and so if i knew

00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,430
everything that you do really is

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,500
extraordinary but you can do all

00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:19,910
basically your selections are about

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,950
based lead you to join you can you know

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:26,140
basically talk to it as if it was just a

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:28,910
regular staff regular table in your debt

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:34,520
so there's more information about Sandra

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:37,160
at this site and then i also have a

00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,670
pretty picture for you because pictures

00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,220
nice so so this business is one simple

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,650
use case that i see for four chord using

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,869
the percentage storage engine where you

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,440
have like multiple immunity instances

00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:54,440
and they are they all are pushing data

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,170
into cassandra and then you can then

00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,210
from at the same

00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,359
from the Cassandra database itself you

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,940
can then pull out your done business

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,670
intelligence tools to run reports and

00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:09,130
other stuff jaspersoft days that's all

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:11,140
of the work with Cassandra so you can

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,930
have it really that is all feeding into

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:17,049
a central Cassandra cluster and then you

00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:20,980
run reports on that databases are kind

00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:24,299
of separate still another one is just to

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:28,660
reverse that you know they say you have

00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:31,599
time dated like a lot seems like that

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,609
and you want new analysis and so

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,410
youryour you have this Cassandra

00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:38,530
customers receiving all of this logging

00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:41,319
data and it's you know it's kind of

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:44,230
unstructured is kind of freeform and a

00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:48,609
lot and so you have examined clusters

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:50,740
then you can connect multiple media

00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:53,890
servers to that and multiple

00:36:50,740 --> 00:37:00,460
applications to the reading the servers

00:36:53,890 --> 00:37:02,530
to run analysis if I may make that that

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,330
that logging data available to your

00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,119
users without having to write a custom

00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:11,730
funded Sandra you can do it with the

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,730
tools that we moved out to query class

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,710
so you don't have to learn a new system

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:23,680
for for your end users another way that

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:26,770
we're that we're doing really is data

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,530
platforms would be next store an engine

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:33,160
this is a very cool thing up at how many

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:40,000
interviews like the CSP snorted ever use

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:44,170
that that's the way ok the CSV sorted

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,750
was away so you can just talk to a CSV

00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,269
file on separated values file as if it

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,899
were

00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:53,659
regular next on the next argument take

00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:58,009
this to the next level it can read CSV

00:37:53,659 --> 00:38:00,949
that DB f of T basically I i thought the

00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:04,729
commune xml files i can connect to any

00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:07,369
other database using odbc and so it

00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:09,789
basically is kind of Swiss Army knife of

00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:15,979
connections to different file formats

00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:18,709
different databases data that you may

00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:22,479
have anymore in your organization it can

00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:24,649
read and write to them so for example

00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:27,549
using the next door dinner with the

00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:32,149
stands for them you can join data

00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:34,519
between your sander database 3d decades

00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:37,339
and your oral database and have a single

00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:41,630
query that very Haldeman use for joining

00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:46,609
it's clever you know we don't want to

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:48,619
dictate how or where your story data you

00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:51,499
know that there are there are reasons to

00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:53,809
choose oral and there are reasons to

00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:56,059
choose the salmon earnings to really be

00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:58,589
and we think that if we can make it

00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:00,960
easier for you

00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:04,680
that phrase all three of them separately

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,890
lets you know use SQL SQL a little

00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,779
awkward congratulations to the world you

00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:12,690
you know be able enable you to use SQL

00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:14,940
that trillion to carry all of them

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,819
simultaneously without having to leave

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,559
the environment interval and so I'm very

00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:24,719
excited about this when the next four

00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:27,539
digit talks are available there the

00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,309
developers really good information so he

00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:30,690
goes through all the examples and

00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:36,210
everything is how to protect there is a

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:37,979
native format how to configure that's

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:41,569
the future and we intend I'm really

00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:43,680
excited about another one another

00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:47,009
alternative database a Lebanese

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,479
coordinated and similar to be his

00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,259
handlers for agenda buttons at the

00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,259
center lovely

00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:02,480
I don't know that development it's the

00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:06,140
same developers created from so I think

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:10,820
oxide finish this address okay as to

00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:13,430
what's next so all right some of the

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:17,540
features that we now get pushed into our

00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:19,850
album releases of Glee bb10 include

00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,870
things like spiders forehead spider

00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:27,380
storage engine is similar to that rated

00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:37,730
it is it started for connecting to

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:42,170
magnetic it all by the sky and that

00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:44,620
we're reading and I don't know how

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:48,670
compares directly to federated

00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:52,510
whether a tax but from what I attended

00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:57,040
popular couple years ago that is first

00:40:52,510 --> 00:41:00,070
another way to connect really old we're

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,800
also doing ed alternatives for attention

00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:05,710
that frisky open source and so we are

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,680
naturally it's an open source miracle to

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,680
include and so we have

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:19,000
there's some things that obv has done

00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:23,540
that our tempers are arguing about

00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,280
that's just so but i will be there

00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,880
eventually as soon as they are

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,430
differences you know why did you do that

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,380
so they'll figure that out and initial

00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:36,320
occupation is there but it's probably

00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:40,700
like embracing that label if you have a

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:43,960
couple things to the code site and find

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,960
more information about that story

00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:53,060
another thing that we're working on with

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:53,060
I diamo compendious security

00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:05,900
calling me a movie we're also working

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,249
with usually offering more optimizations

00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:12,650
and we actually when we when we first

00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:15,799
talked about the fusion-io optimization

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:18,470
that we were putting in we least almost

00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:22,910
instantly heard from several the food /

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:27,619
members we've also want work with is so

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,760
so we expect we have many as Africa

00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:35,400
portable have many

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:38,640
flash board includes and then you know

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:43,080
is this is an / project anyone most get

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,820
the ball camp and help shape of that so

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,130
what is the road up right now how does

00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,780
this you know if you're planning your

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,780
enterprise you're trying to figure out

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:58,680
and you know what how do I plan is he on

00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,320
a lot of my making a TV you know what's

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,650
going to be in buffer so Romo as a stand

00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:07,680
right now as I said it's already a super

00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:10,320
set of features from mysql and the full

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,589
maisto 56 merge the month you want to

00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,420
take everything eventually this is going

00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:17,430
to be innovative in two steps the first

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,490
is the current out releases that we're

00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:24,510
doing and

00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:25,950
and then you have a as soon as that if

00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:28,800
they're stable will start working on

00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:31,080
attend on one series and sell go through

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,420
the same the same process and by

00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,930
intimate end up one series all the

00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:42,270
important features glasgow 56 will be

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:48,420
there but first ken doll unstable be

00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:51,510
coming up next year so for all active

00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,490
versus if you want to know well better

00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,609
when will read me the fully compatible

00:43:53,490 --> 00:44:00,210
with my skill 56 that's the official

00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:02,910
word as i know it today it will be a

00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:06,780
drama replacement for blacksville Wessex

00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:09,690
really deep end up whatever is what is

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:15,930
Thursday will be accompanied by support

00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:20,609
license all right um some good questions

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:21,570
that we get a lot reputation people are

00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:25,890
always wondering

00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:28,200
well I have a I have a 5 out 5 master

00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:31,350
and have several spike up my slaves can

00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,020
I drop in a Ken dolls like you know

00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:37,470
things like that you know just kind of

00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:40,620
test the waters and so can ever pay for

00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:44,460
my scope by six to really be ten the

00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:49,160
entities you cant cannot replicate from

00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:54,050
really be 10 to read my hot yes okay

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:58,830
caturday 3d10 to mysql 55 or 56 and

00:44:54,050 --> 00:45:08,070
unfortunately assessment so so just just

00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:11,070
the way way that we attend what kind of

00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:15,960
animal it is if you're running to read

00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:19,140
10 master only kind of replicating to do

00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:22,790
it myself i high or plastic slave but

00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,790
the reversal merciful

00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:31,990
also for any of your developers and do

00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,870
tools based on TV I flew this because it

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:38,850
seems like people ask us this a lot how

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:42,580
could I know you know how you compare so

00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:44,440
when you do a subversion on Maria db10

00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:48,580
when you turn whatever it is you know

00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,410
1000 two 1000 for whatever reading so so

00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:52,450
with your tool maker and you're trying

00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:55,930
to find out what that makes perfect

00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,520
ending to that's how you find out in the

00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,220
handshake back in to have a longer

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,430
version string and it will show the root

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:08,710
of the version of a rear DVD 55 that is

00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:12,610
merged in plus the version of me 10 so

00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:19,750
that you know that this is really deep

00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:22,300
end up to based on 5 30 which can help

00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:26,580
with discovery but what features school

00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:30,280
today we really encourage homemakers to

00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:32,260
start recognizing really be for what it

00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,320
is because of our additional feature set

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,609
we have additional statistics that

00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,609
people can gather we have microsecond

00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:43,249
other features that tools could really

00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:45,739
take advantage of and if they just if

00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:47,630
they just assumed that maybe is the same

00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:49,910
as last tutorial for a version

00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,890
number then they're missing out on some

00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,589
good features that they could I'm used

00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:58,220
to enhance their their product and so we

00:46:54,589 --> 00:47:08,869
really strongly encourage all cool acres

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:16,690
to start looking for specifically here's

00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:20,630
a big list of resources okay so without

00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:26,150
green EDD 10 the main information age

00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:29,299
3-10 is this what is really an page our

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,279
knowledge base and that pages kept up to

00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:35,869
date with every release so if you want

00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:41,150
to go on very recently and today it will

00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:43,910
be on that visit on that make summer we

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:49,339
also have some blog post which are which

00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:53,859
goes there which are good for that you

00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:53,859
sort of laundry board was a good

00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,770
retention post lots of interesting stuff

00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,770
there

00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:11,300
okay so resources really the other

00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:15,070
organs of a website that website a

00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,780
frontline an ATV foundation by size 12

00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:19,930
Oh gravity

00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:23,410
it's the foundation website now with the

00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:26,740
set up a foundation all loves shortly

00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,720
will take you to our dear instance our

00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,790
mailing list and we expressed me

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,590
developers lists or straight places that

00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:37,480
we discussed remember users we

00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:40,690
developers or working on code we're also

00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:44,380
on Twitter Google+ Facebook our IRC

00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,980
channel is always there's always someone

00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,980
from the couple

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,720
the world that's just how Maria Medina

00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:58,270
and in our knowledge base is produced

00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,650
occult our documentation our goal with

00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:04,240
our documentation is to eventually

00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:06,970
replace the Maya snowmen completely but

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,640
our priority is to document the new

00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:15,520
stuff first and that felt when awesome

00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:18,100
so we have the developers and myself try

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,790
to work on all new stuff that's quickly

00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,250
completely isn't care and then we have

00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:27,120
working on the back portion trying to

00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:30,900
make sure that that it eventually become

00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,760
a complete replacement for the Vice no

00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,640
man it's not now but if there's

00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:40,920
something that's not an anomaly then you

00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:44,160
can just go to the lifestyle site so I

00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:50,520
guess before moving on are there any

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:55,310
questions all right I thought it might

00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,310
be fun to to use some benchmarks Oh

00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:03,050
already run to do some benchmarks you

00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,050
know

00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:13,930
always fun and this this Victor specific

00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:16,600
is segmented my advice mph is one of my

00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:19,390
favorite is just because it is such an

00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,910
awesome looking draft basically this is

00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:24,190
segmented keycaps also major be online

00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:29,010
for my eyes that's better reasons like I

00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:31,870
to so the oldest an old feature Kruger

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:35,440
but it is it illustrates some

00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:38,380
performances ever do so so you have you

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,310
know nobody cash and I mean that with

00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:45,120
the decaf and so the major major

00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:53,560
improvement in speed which I think of

00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:55,750
another one is match key access and you

00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:59,680
can see a lieutenants improve with a rst

00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:00,960
of we've also with all I skyrockets with

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,140
all statistics

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:09,660
their homes on your own data sets might

00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:13,940
out of this works for you so but on our

00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:18,300
testing makes off with 10x improvement

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:20,829
in reports which was always beautiful

00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:24,190
and we also like it when

00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:27,069
suggestive on our own portal to us so we

00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,959
can get a real sense of the improvement

00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:30,519
one of these was we have rooted in

00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:33,249
binary lock where you at all these

00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:35,769
commits coming in and instead of write

00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:38,890
them all individually to the law we

00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:43,900
would've been possible and so mark

00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:45,249
Callahan at Facebook branded so when you

00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,940
do when you have that here to have the

00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:51,489
original last well performance and then

00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,049
basically did their own passes they had

00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:54,969
they had the version one of their patch

00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:58,359
and version two of their password

00:51:54,969 --> 00:52:00,700
created quite a bit but then we use the

00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:03,579
Facebook code and then we knew Gradle

00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:07,809
that even improve upon that which was

00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:12,519
really cool and so so trying to you know

00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:16,420
our region it is super fast and bass big

00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:21,430
speed ups and Mark did the testing and

00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:22,809
and talk about it on his feet worship

00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,789
datebooks of course the posted to

00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:28,900
Facebook he was very happy about that

00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:32,079
but it's also problems and they were

00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,579
having when he got above you know he

00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,989
always had publicly got above like

00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:39,670
saying 128 256 concur applies the UC is

00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:43,690
dropping performance we were able to

00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:46,630
keep it to say now long past that and

00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:49,599
then we didn't stop there because it 10

00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:52,869
we may have even faster and we used to

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,709
come to prevent some routine check for

00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:58,869
commits 81 in free up space and then

00:52:55,709 --> 00:53:01,660
reducing this all together speed up

00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:04,359
Eddie so this this shows this is

00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:08,349
comparing your enemies creating and so

00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:11,529
you have you know we were able to get a

00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:13,420
bigger bump so so even even though it

00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:17,529
was really fast by five identity

00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,729
including a lot of that okay which is

00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,890
something we always like to see we never

00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:23,910
want to see regression

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,980
a goat regression for that and trying to

00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:31,380
always improve it always make it always

00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:35,670
make it faster blast last pretty charge

00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:37,650
is comparing group trip and the spices

00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:42,599
how about self-improvement feature that

00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:44,309
they and so we of course random

00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:50,180
benchmarking exit and ours was still

00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:54,650
slightly back which is always nice so

00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:58,740
okay now now there's for the creature

00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:04,230
all right any questions all right oh yes

00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:09,170
sir workman we're ability to yes

00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:16,490
it one more obviously

00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:20,370
it's going to be holy yeah zarina horny

00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:22,950
right now do you know how the in-house

00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:26,100
expertise provided to like prevent &

00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:29,640
workbench is adorable so you know

00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:34,800
they're very creaks or previous day long

00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:36,180
I just got that's a good thing so I hope

00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,750
that they live up there other new

00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,160
schools that that people go up again you

00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:44,690
know I think market open for someone

00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:47,100
just about that space just yeah yeah

00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:50,520
there's some if someone did buy a tool

00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,350
that reflect I think I see a lot of it

00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,570
is a very useful tool people really like

00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:57,300
it especially I don't like Molly and

00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:59,640
everything you can do you know but yeah

00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,410
another today doesn't support the

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:07,140
reading features and so and so nice to

00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,060
have a tool to get so I know on windows

00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,010
which we ship is girl that's that

00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:14,240
different mortgage it's just a duty

00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:17,040
client but they've been very open to

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:22,770
supporting our various features which is

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:29,480
nice but that's a window home we could

00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:29,480
really use it anything else yeah

00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:41,839
it's like a prepackaged said I don't

00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,180
know that we've done that you guys are

00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:51,260
going to do that do you know anything

00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:57,140
that actually really yeah i personally

00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:59,359
use it for ya I mean the one thing is

00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:02,359
nice is as as we moved into

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,520
distributions then writing you when you

00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:07,520
establish that from there then it just

00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:10,550
works like if you did on fedora when you

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,030
install a lamp second of your 19 reached

00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:16,760
all maps definitely some reason so but

00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:18,950
nothing nothing at standard that i know

00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,589
i know i know there's like zero install

00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:25,690
lat stacks you can just like on tar and

00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:25,690
run with her doubt

00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:43,130
yeah I know I know there's probably

00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:46,460
called elastic which which does that

00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:49,099
their cloud company and they they have a

00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:51,859
onion soup configuration thing for me

00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:54,380
are you on their son their servers no

00:56:51,859 --> 00:56:57,710
used to spit up these instances ma they

00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:00,770
have one specific degree so you can do

00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:02,480
that if if you're doing effort we are

00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:06,500
running with the OpenStack people as

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,050
well or like like the rats basis of the

00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,970
world we're trying to ruin them right

00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:14,359
now they're deep the default for the

00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:16,250
whole stack standard is my school but we

00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:18,859
want to get in there as an alternative

00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:22,089
at least so that you can choose it when

00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:22,089
you're configuring your virtual

00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,050
working

00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:48,509
yes well this is romeo some schooling

00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,509
and

00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,270
alright

00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,610
you

00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:27,730
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,680
ago we could not have imagined that

00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,900
asterisk would not only become the most

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,030
widely adopted open source communication

00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,070
software on the planet but that it would

00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:38,590
impact the entire industry in the way

00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:40,570
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:43,210
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:45,160
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:47,260
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,640
transition of power from the hands of

00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,920
the traditional proprietary phone

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,320
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,240
administrators of phone systems using

00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,470
this power our customers have created

00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,420
all sorts of business changing

00:58:56,470 --> 00:59:00,280
applications from small office phone

00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,800
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,390
the international carrier networks in

00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,190
fact there's even an entire country

00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:08,560
those communications infrastructure runs

00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:10,690
on esters the gym has always been about

00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,430
creating technology that expands

00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,590
communications capabilities in ways that

00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,790
we could never have imagined and that's

00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,160
part of what's game-changing about

00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:20,860
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,960
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,090
IP phones that extends control of the

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,830
user all the way to the desktop the

00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,540
launch of these new products represents

00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:30,640
the next phase indigenous history of

00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:33,040
innovation these are the first and only

00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,390
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,070
power of esther's when we first

00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:37,720
discussed our expectations for building

00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:40,330
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,100
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,870
asked the team to build the phones such

00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,060
that they were easy to install integrate

00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:47,920
provision in use I think you'll soon

00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:50,470
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,120
that goal user feedback is validating

00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:54,220
that when it comes to operation with

00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,650
astro space systems including our own

00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:59,230
switchvox based product these are the

00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:00,520
easiest to use best integrated most

00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:03,130
interoperable products on the market

01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:05,100
today the digitally of phones will

01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:07,210
initially include three IP des hommes

01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,100
uniquely designed to complement any

01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,990
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,660
these phones are different for a number

01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:16,300
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,740
designed for use with esters secondly

01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,350
we've made it really easy to

01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,730
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:23,410
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,370
to access information inside of

01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:27,370
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,330
between an application and the phone

01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,490
additionally we've created an

01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:33,620
applications engine that allows users

01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:36,860
and developers to create and run their

01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:38,630
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,580
done all of this at a very compelling

01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:42,260
price point at Digium we're always

01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:44,360
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,880
the best value in business phone systems

01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,470
and also give them the power to create

01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,630
their own solutions or any

01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,370
communications challenge will continue

01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,810
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,850
astros cooler bastard more

01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:57,590
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:00:55,850 --> 01:01:00,110
asterisk and communications even easier

01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:03,640
and together we'll change the way the

01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:03,640
world communication again

01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:20,850
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:23,040
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:26,490
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:30,320
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:33,840
happening in open source the

01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:35,640
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,560
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,720
these are these you know these

01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,030
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,880
discovered and then fixed is the thing

01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:47,880
that really shows the power of the of

01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,360
the open source community it is global

01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,880
and it's definitely because of the users

01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:59,520
community people are extremely friendly

01:01:53,880 --> 01:02:01,410
and they're always ready to help if you

01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,690
go on tire see any day you'll see these

01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:05,420
guys helping each other out and they're

01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,130
all doing it like in a selfless manner

01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:11,120
the product is transparent for everyone

01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:14,310
everyone can look at the code base

01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,550
everyone can see how close that is being

01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:22,050
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:24,690
everything is open in many ways it's

01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:29,130
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:33,330
health CloudStack the most exciting

01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:36,160
event in recent memory for me was our

01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:38,829
first developer boot camp

01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,470
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:45,430
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:49,599
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:52,450
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,970
chairs in the room twice everything

01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:58,299
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:02:54,970 --> 01:03:01,270
is open source and so I don't think that

01:02:58,299 --> 01:03:03,039
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:06,069
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,799
computing and so i think it's i think

01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:10,150
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,260
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:16,809
talking about open source cloud

01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:19,839
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:21,970
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:26,260
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:28,930
in each data centers these hardware is

01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:32,410
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:35,109
to handle number one that mass scale

01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:38,289
number two it's designed to handle the

01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:40,599
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:43,390
deployments we started working on

01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:47,049
college attack over four years ago and

01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:49,480
it was the original set of people

01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:51,670
working on it had a background of

01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:55,480
delivering software telcos and service

01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:59,859
providers lots of QA lots of users

01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:03,010
actually using it high availability is

01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:06,460
the key feature multiple hypervisors

01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:09,010
support different network models you can

01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:11,049
pick up whatever suits you better while

01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:14,980
step management server can be deployed

01:04:11,049 --> 01:04:16,779
in different physical machines it

01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,400
definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:04:16,779 --> 01:04:23,799
being deployed everywhere there's a

01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:25,539
major movie studio that they were using

01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:28,690
cloudstack they were using it to

01:04:25,539 --> 01:04:30,910
transcode video and i thought that was

01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:32,230
terribly fascinating what i found more

01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:35,500
fascinating is what they did during

01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:38,289
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:39,670
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:41,270
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:45,560
the instances and go back

01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:47,030
it'll work cloudstack is vast it touches

01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,130
so many different aspects and there's no

01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:51,500
one person that's kind of like a master

01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:55,610
of all those realms I think cloudstack

01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:57,830
as a project is going to be one of the

01:04:55,610 --> 01:05:01,910
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:07,340
most feature fallen and and robust

01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:10,240
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,240
living through the clouds dag

01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:58,789
most enterprises today realize that

01:05:56,539 --> 01:06:00,499
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:02,869
enough to keep their network safe from

01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:04,910
unauthorized intrusions that's why

01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:06,949
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:09,079
popular lately that adds that extra

01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:11,749
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:13,519
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:06:11,749 --> 01:06:15,709
know is that some two-factor

01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:17,930
authentication solutions they're better

01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:20,989
than others like two-factor strong

01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:23,239
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:25,219
beyond other authentication systems by

01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:28,279
being less expensive easier to implement

01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:30,739
and easier to use giving software-based

01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:33,619
token clients built to run on all major

01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:36,189
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:38,539
Android these tokens utilize a

01:06:36,189 --> 01:06:40,999
public/private key combination that's

01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:42,890
generated on device so there aren't any

01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:45,410
shared secrets flying around or

01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:48,289
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:50,150
special handling instead all keys are

01:06:48,289 --> 01:06:52,609
kept secure and private between the

01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:54,799
requesting token and your server which

01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:56,420
you control in-house making it the most

01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:59,089
secure way possible to perform

01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:01,880
authentication encryption and with an

01:06:59,089 --> 01:07:04,670
extensive flexible API and support for

01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:06,650
protocols like ldap and radius wicked

01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:08,030

business critical systems humming along

01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:47,710
requires insight into what they're doing

01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,660
your system metrics tells stories

01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,670
stories that can reveal performance

01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:53,980
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:55,570
other problems but how do you keep an

01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,210

agent will begin collecting data and

01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,800
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:02,050
start rolling use long view to gain

01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:06,810
visibility into your servers so when
