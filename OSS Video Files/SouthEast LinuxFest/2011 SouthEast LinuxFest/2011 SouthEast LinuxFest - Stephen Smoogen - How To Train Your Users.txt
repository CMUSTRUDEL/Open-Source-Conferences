it so I'm filling in for him goodbye my

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,250
name is Steve smoochin I'm a recovering

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,229
system administrator I know I'm only

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,010
supposed to use my first name but well

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:09,600
you all have already downloaded

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:16,920
everything you need to know about me

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:19,110
just to make sure I'm legitimate I'm

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,360
here to fill this hour with advice and

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,070
knowledge from my 25 years of system

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,970
administration following contains truths

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,369
half-truths outright lies and maybe a

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,619
little bit of something that helps you

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:39,329
along in the way currently I have worked

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,110
well I have worked for the government

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,020
I've worked for educational institutions

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,119
I've kind of worked for the military

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:52,649
I've worked for red hat software for

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,979
four years and then I took a long break

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,340
and I started up with red hat again on

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:06,360
the Fedora project about two or three

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,700
years ago I worked on centos 5 and have

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,040
done little things here and there all

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,569
through that time

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:19,989
most that time I have been a system

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:22,569
administrator my job here today other

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:26,980
than to fill this hour is help train you

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:31,829
guys on our help help you find ways that

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,829
you can train your users to be better

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:43,120
things why do we need this training in

00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:47,019
here because frankly most of us never

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:52,719
woke up and wanted to be a sis admit we

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:58,209
started off as secretaries physicists

00:02:52,719 --> 00:03:04,810
maybe even the piano player but fell

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:09,280
into this life of degrading crime you

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:14,199
may it started off with you know you

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:21,250
fixed a jammed printer you found the

00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:23,019
bosses any key or like myself you just

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,659
walked in the wrong door at the wrong

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:34,329
time and they said your can you fix that

00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:37,290
okay anyway you end up as a system

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:43,509
administrator it always starts off small

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:47,590
you know you fix the jam printer then

00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:55,689
somebody asks you can you make it print

00:03:47,590 --> 00:04:00,219
two copies and soon well you have to fix

00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:03,060
the toner problem and eventually you

00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:05,739
somebody says we're using too much toner

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,659
you start on it and you start on and you

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,789
finally have changed the whole print

00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,560
queue so that instead of printing at

00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,409
your printer you printed the printer

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,810
across the street because well it's not

00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,720
your toner anymore

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,489
and Bob who asked you to do this he

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,040
needs to walk anyway he's eating all

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:28,900
your doughnuts it's a bad life and at

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,200
that moment you have made the step you

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:36,669
have started training your user a not to

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:46,060
ask you questions and be how to get

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:48,010
things done sure Bob needs to lose that

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,270
ten pounds he's gained from krispy

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,729
kremes but doesn't stop him from eating

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,780
more donuts when he comes back and

00:04:53,729 --> 00:05:01,620
asking you more questions and while we

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,880
would love to use the clue by four

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:12,160
frankly we're all a little too pretty

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:17,530
for prison so what does a modern

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,840
insisted mins supposed to do we could

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,860
take CSI courses but all you really

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:29,530
learn this quicklime doesn't work as

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:32,169
well as they say in the movies and so

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,400
there has to be a better answer and I am

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:37,240
here to try and help you with that

00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,340
answer one that I've cribbed from my

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:46,389
many courses in my failed attempt to get

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:50,440
a psychology degree Skinner tests or as

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:56,470
they call it now advanced behavior sorry

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:58,660
applied behavior analysis or ABA it is

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:03,000
basically the standard thing of a

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:05,169
skinner test a doctor BF Skinner is

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,830
credit is there's many other scientists

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:12,310
involved but he's credited with it yet

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:15,190
yet take a lever you put a rat and if

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,000
the rat hits the lever he gets a shot of

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,820
heroin and then you see how many times

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,610
he'll hit the head hammer to get another

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,400
shot and eventually you train train them

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,820
to go by the crack bring it in process

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,250
it for EM you

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,780
and move on you know all this may sound

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,570
familiar to anyone who's ever had to

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:43,280
train a dog but let's face it you dogs

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:48,050
are easier to train than users but the

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:54,860
concepts the same you take a task you

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:56,570
break it into individual parts say we're

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,680
dealing with a printer problem that we

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:03,800
always have to deal with it Weaver you

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,750
show them how to pull out the tray you

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,790
show them how to flick the paper so it

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,560
doesn't build up static electricity you

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:15,380
put the tray back in you step it all

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,510
through and if they do it right you give

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:25,100
them a reward they do it wrong now

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:29,540
frankly the old school where I came from

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:35,780
you hit him with a Taser but it doesn't

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:38,990
work tasers do not as much as they show

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,490
in the guides and movies the guy gets

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,930
back up right afterwards and now you

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,860
have to deal with a pissed off user

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,950
who's full of adrenaline it doesn't go

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,350
very pretty from there instead you need

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:55,810
to neutrally let them know that they did

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,810
it wrong and step them through it again

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,380
so how do you figure out what is a

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,820
behavior that you're trying to change

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,710
because it's all a behavior of whether

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,949
it's asking them asking you questions at

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,510
two o'clock in the morning or how to

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,220
fill up the printer because if no one

00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:23,070
else knows how to do it or that they're

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,910
sending emails to themselves that

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:30,600
they're backing up all their laptops

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,860
using email of their email to themselves

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:37,260
that they're going to back up their

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:44,330
laptops and then they wonder why emails

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:49,020
not working well again it comes down to

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:52,110
simplify break the tasks up train them

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,150
slowly it takes a long time to do this

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,790
you can't do this one at a time or

00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:01,140
expect a magic bullet in the next day

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,700
first we have need to observe and record

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,580
the current behaviors the users have a

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,890
behavior is usually defined as something

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:19,110
a living being does to a stimulus a

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:21,330
Taser to buy for a clicking thing that

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,740
says click me now click me now on their

00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:29,010
page generally if a dead person does it

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:35,760
it isn't a behavior that is the standard

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:37,830
psychology test for this my lawyers have

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,270
asked me not to make sure that you know

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,529
that this is not a license for you to

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,529
find out what dead people do

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,339
they all we are only allowed to say that

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,810
this is a rhetorical point with the

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:56,769
expectation that you don't do anything

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:58,510
beyond bloat and rot end quote second we

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,010
take behaviors and label which ones we

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,430
wish to keep and which ones we wish to

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,220
remove or loitering us to strange

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,930
behavior of the computer keep not

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:14,949
clicking on organ enlargement ads keep

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:17,110
paging is a 2am because the printer is

00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:21,120
saying blinky light blinky light and

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,130
they don't know what to do don't keep

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,350
third we need to observe the behaviors

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,500
and figure out the stimuli or tasks that

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,920
prompt them break these tasks down into

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,199
their atomic components the reason for

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,420
doing this is that most of us most of

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:42,180
these tasks we think are simple or in

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:44,740
fact confusingly obtuse to most people

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:48,519
we the you've ever looked all over

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,779
looked those obtuse tits or we've

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,610
forgotten it through all the beer we

00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:58,839
drank after we fixed the problem take

00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,339
filling a printer with paper depending

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,430
on the printer it can take eight to

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,740
twenty individual items to get the paper

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,329
to properly work in a printer most

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,699
people don't realize that in fact we

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,850
don't realize that when we do this we

00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:14,620
just do this we finish we're done for

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,899
the standard user they look at it and

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,149
all they see is a painful set of tasks

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:24,279
ahead of them full of punishments now

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:30,310
it's usually us punishing them but we're

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:31,540
trying to find a better way I again my

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,480
lawyers have asked me to keep your

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,050
hobbies at home and we will just stick

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:42,250
with nice neutral ways of fixing our

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,130
user problems now we need to train per

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,589
component this is not a simple thing it

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:53,439
may require multiple times to train your

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:55,910
user open the tray close the tray open

00:11:53,439 --> 00:12:00,290
the tray close the tray

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:04,220
I have actually had a user put the tray

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:08,450
in backwards it took them a hammer to do

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:12,860
so but they did so honestly it was they

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:15,250
went couldn't get it in there and

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:26,840
thought they were doing it wrong so they

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:28,490
kept pushing it as we walk through these

00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,630
things you need to find a reward system

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:36,080
for your user I find Eminem's work

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:40,010
really well you toss them an M&M right

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,970
afterwards or you give them a reward

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:46,280
like you find some toys and geek geek

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,940
toy if they're geeky you give them two

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,770
minutes with it they learn the task you

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,910
take the toilet way that you move them

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:58,550
to the next task if you're depending on

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,730
other users you can go to dollar store

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,800
and buy a bag of little cowboys and

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,140
Indians and stack them up on your desk

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,390
and when they when you're done playing

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:15,560
with them you can then use them as

00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:17,540
rewards to the other users again if we

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,250
miss a step when they're doing it when

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,200
you're like loading okay we've put the

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,800
paper in but they forgot to spray the

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:30,020
paper so that doesn't stick we do not

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:33,470
yell at them it's hard but we have to be

00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:37,930
nice and neutral with them think of them

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:43,850
as a chihuahua with less brains it helps

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,260
but we do not again we must the reason

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,450
we do this we want to say at a neutral

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:52,430
tone is that you eventually you're

00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:56,540
building up a their ability to seek out

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:59,330
pain it happens that's the only if the

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,100
only interaction they're getting with

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,530
you is you yelling at them they will

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:08,209
begin to seek it out so we need to stay

00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:10,309
away from that go to a nice neutral area

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,679
you need to record the progress that

00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,149
you're doing with your users you have a

00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:17,629
little three by five card or something

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:20,209
keep it straight the reason being is

00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,949
that if they go to quickly you've known

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,449
you've broken it down to you've got a

00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,040
good color group and you've broken it

00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:27,550
down too far and you can combine things

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,529
up if they're not progressing at all

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,420
they may never progress in this task at

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,429
which point you'll need to work around

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,179
it and keep them away from the bright

00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:42,110
shiny toy or they will try to fix the

00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:44,240
printer by themselves and then want to

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,369
know why all the black stuff is all in

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,740
their face and hands and on the floor

00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:54,319
and on the walls and in the cubicle and

00:14:51,740 --> 00:15:01,730
on your door and your cubicles they go

00:14:54,319 --> 00:15:03,559
what's going on we come down to the next

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,749
step which is after you've gotten them

00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,720
training on here they will come to

00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:10,850
expect three wards which can be prey the

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,040
mms are the toys that you want to keep

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,069
to yourselves as much as possible but

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:20,179
you need to share and you need to back

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:21,679
off the reward system basically at a

00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:29,029
certain point we need to go and tell

00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:31,879
them good job good going keep it up you

00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,670
need to mix it up a bit also because

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,220
they become if you keep giving them an

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:42,649
mms they will just not listen to it

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:45,459
anymore uh actually praise is very good

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,559
it's especially good if you record it

00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:50,660
because later during your review with

00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,279
your boss you can play their praise to

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:58,279
show that you actually treat your users

00:15:52,279 --> 00:16:03,439
well it also can usefully later in a

00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:05,059
court okay now we're down to you got

00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:06,709
we've got behaviors that we want them to

00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:09,649
learn and now we're wanting to get rid

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:12,319
of behaviors it's very similar there are

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,999
multiple methods for doing this the

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,069
hardest method is actually the most

00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:18,699
effective like most things it is called

00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,699
extinguishing

00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:24,650
again we keep our we're not trying to

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,640
kill anybody here but it means more on

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:32,000
the lines of ignoring the bad behavior

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:38,870
the user comes in yells at you you

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,310
ignore them you have you or you redirect

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,540
them and say in a very nice calm tone I

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,170
didn't understand that could you try

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,970
that again it resets them because

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,070
they're expecting you to yell back it's

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,480
their game they've just they've learned

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,910
this little game they like to hop around

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,680
and yell at you and then expect you to

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:03,170
yell back at them because it's what they

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:06,110
expect from our sis admit now this works

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:10,610
for most users there are prima donnas

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:13,700
out there who are have never gotten past

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:19,150
the two-year-old stage they're usually

00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:27,500
considered valued employees you need to

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:33,110
accept that and move on and not go get

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:37,280
carpet pieces and used cars that you can

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:41,240
dump in a lake it doesn't work they

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,400
catch on to you eventually but users the

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,920
prima donna users you need extinguishing

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,930
works really well because a lot of them

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,000
are expecting this whole game they've

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,820
come to it since they've been eight or

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,710
nine that if they yell and scream and

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,600
lay on the floor and bang up their legs

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,040
and down they will get what they want

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:04,390
from a sis admit again neutral quiet

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,530
tones keep it nice and clear and

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,670
eventually most of them will say well I

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,620
know this game is not going to work with

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,540
you anymore I'll I'll talk to you like a

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,070
normal person and you'll find out that

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,900
they may become your best friend and do

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:20,870
fix bugs for you in software that

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:23,240
they're supposed to be writing or

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,070
they'll go find another company where

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,620
they can get away with it it works both

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,620
ways you win either way

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,090
together to get ahead here we need to

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:42,330
steadily ignore the behavior I've

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:44,040
already said that or you can use a if

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,940
you're going to use a punishment method

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:52,040
to redirect the user you need to use

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:54,600
something that is small and slight

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,130
depending on your HR department you made

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,760
get away with being able to bang a

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,770
newspaper on the table some HR

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
departments allowed others do not find

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:10,200
out from them first they are quite the

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:17,570
ones to use it already if they will not

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,570
allow it you need to find other things a

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:32,070
quiet Yale gal staring them in the face

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,620
that works really well you keep them

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,260
eyes on them and eventually if they're

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:43,980
they know they've done bad they'll look

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:47,190
down to the corner it works again as I

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,980
said earlier cattle prods and tasers are

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:56,790
not as effective as they sound neither

00:19:49,980 --> 00:20:04,170
is mace I have seen people who have hit

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:05,970
users that is a career limiting move the

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,040
other reason is is once you've hit the

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,560
user and they're not unconscious you've

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,970
wiped out their short-term memory they

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,910
wake up they do the same thing over

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,850
again because they've forgotten what had

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,990
happened now you can hit them over and

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,510
over again but it's not going to help

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:27,360
any now this is all sounding fun and

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,530
games but there are actually examples of

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,530
how this works in real life

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,770
early in my career I had a very bad user

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:46,380
I was working at a year at Los Alamos

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:48,929
and I had a postdoc who reminded me my

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:53,309
first day that I only had a bachelor's

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:56,039
and therefore I worked for him and him

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:59,480
alone because he was he had two postdocs

00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,480
and the rest of these people were just

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,480
graduate students and he would come and

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:10,850
call me at two o'clock in the morning

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:18,690
for things like fill the printer paper

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:22,590
make some coffee the internet is down

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:25,289
and this is 94 and the reason was is it

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,480
he'd unplugged the coax cable to his

00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:32,549
thing and not plugged it in correctly

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,799
and I'd go in and all this I was getting

00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,900
really ready for the two-by-four and my

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,650
boss at that time who has been in the

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,840
business for a lot longer she'd been in

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:47,520
since the 60s gave me a very important

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,860
lesson I was a contractor and I hadn't

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,280
been properly billing these hours so he

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,770
had me go through a formal step I told

00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:01,429
everyone in the organization how to do

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,429
these jobs how to make the coffee how to

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:08,880
fill up the printer paper how to

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:11,100
reconnect cables properly how to check

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,289
if the cables were in by looking at the

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,880
lights on the back of your computer had

00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:16,380
nice little write-ups I printed it out

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,809
had nice little printouts everywhere

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:23,130
these had to be done I also had a little

00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:25,080
thing of what it costs to call me in and

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,690
if you called in you had to send an

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,909
email to this site otherwise I could not

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,520
start on a job after hours I was only

00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:37,230
theirs for a 25 I was on emergency call

00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:42,370
otherwise this didn't stop that the

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:44,860
student the postdoc he called me in

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,020
two o'clock three o'clock in the morning

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,580
I was luckily I lived across the street

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,830
from where are we working so I just

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,960
walked across in my pajamas with a robe

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,960
on fixed whatever it was and went back

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:03,220
all the hours were put in properly and

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:05,320
it came for my paycheck and because it

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:09,700
had been Memorial Day weekend and I got

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:14,110
paid if it was after hours I got four

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,820
times pay if it was on a weekend it was

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,530
an additional two times and if it was on

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,070
a holiday i got an additional two times

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:28,120
I earned two hundred ninety six hours of

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:32,110
overtime in a two-week period that would

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:36,220
that cost his postdoc account twenty-six

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,510
thousand dollars which basically wiped

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,170
him out for the whole quarter and he had

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:45,820
to go back to the University now with

00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,590
the important lesson here was I got

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,480
called into the manager and he asks me

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:53,710
why how can you put in 296 hours I I

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,250
brought in all the reams of stuff my

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:59,650
bosses told me to bring in which was all

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,570
the emails saying why these things were

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,910
important all the stuff that I had done

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,610
and it got approved and like I said the

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,040
post doc had to go actually took him one

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,390
more two week period and then his

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,300
account was completely wiped out and

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,790
they sent it back to the University but

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:23,360
it paid off my student loans so I was

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:26,179
very happy the

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,620
the other thing it turned out was by

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,870
doing all these little things even to

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,720
the coffee maker I had fulfilled my ISO

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:35,090
9000 requirements for that quarter I

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,490
hadn't even known I had iso 9000

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,950
requirements but i did i had to label

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:45,309
all this stuff i had to break down

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:45,309
documents and procedures I got a bonus

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,160
um no I thought this was supposed to be

00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,990
training the user in this but it turned

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,590
out it wasn't training the user it

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,059
trains the manager am i bought my boss

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,410
because this is a government thing you

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,280
have managers you have bosses and

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,890
they're two completely two different

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,780
people the boss tells you what to do and

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,520
how to do it the managers just signs the

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:13,970
check and then yells at you when you go

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,830
over things he came in and said showed

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,840
me that you know my manager only looks

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,600
at my things every two weeks to sign the

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,669
checks otherwise he doesn't care I exist

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,549
as long as he's not being yelled at by

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,679
the users so he wasn't being yelled at

00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:30,260
by the users the users loved me they had

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,540
finally somebody who they actually felt

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,540
empowered that they could turn on their

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,150
Mac boxes and move their Mac boxes

00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,890
around on the thin net without the whole

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,590
network going down because no one had

00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,450
shown them that they weren't supposed to

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,130
unplug the two clips on the back they

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,140
could just twist this little thing pull

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,610
it off so they were all during the day

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,590
they were unplugging things pulling

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,000
things apart moving their Mac around to

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,460
another part to work with somebody else

00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,910
and then I'd have to come around and

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,010
bring be the connectors back in tie it

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:06,919
back in because everybody else was

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:09,650
yelling at me that works down Oh God and

00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:12,919
I also showed them how to set up the

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:14,270
backup client so that instead what they

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,610
had been doing to back up all their

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,320
stuff every day was they were emailing

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,410
themselves because I knew the email

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,179
servers were always backed up and they

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,250
had a little IMAP client and whatever

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:28,460
Macintosh was or a pop thing or whatever

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,080
this is back in 94-95 and they were

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,669
taking everything on their desktop and

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,380
they had a folder and they would put it

00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:36,110
in the folder and it would save it all

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:40,280
as emails on the email server which was

00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:42,290
10 miles away on 81 link and it would

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,450
just sit there and everything would bind

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,490
down at four o'clock because it's a thin

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,820
net wire and there's no it's all

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:52,400
collisions so I showed them how instead

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,540
that if you set this thing up you press

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,120
a little button that was already on

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,710
there and put in a time at three o'clock

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,440
in the morning would back up the systems

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,870
and they could they wouldn't have all

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,120
these problems and I had a little

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:09,110
diagram for them because i realized that

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,490
i put most the diagrams by the two

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,120
things that are most important to a

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:20,900
user's life the coffee machine and the

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:24,169
toilet usually those near each other but

00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:26,540
you put i put one set there and i put

00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:28,130
another set in the toilet so that when

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,690
they went in they could read the stuff

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,880
while they're concentrating on other

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:36,100
things and they could learn how to do

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:42,280
their job without asking me to do it

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:46,580
because while we were assisted mins and

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,290
we have other things in our lives we

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,750
spend most of our times on interrupts

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,850
dealing with little tiny things well

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,440
they're tiny to us but they're not tiny

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,470
of the people we're dealing with there

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,960
are usually big cry cc's because they

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:05,960
have other drivers like that deadline

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,720
and all that I I'm supposed to be you

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,880
know building a whole new mail system

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,350
for them let's not ten miles away but

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,570
local and it's not working because I'm

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,140
spending all my entire time going oh my

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:25,610
god the printer is out of paper again

00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:27,650
because being scientists they would

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,080
write everything on the computer and the

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:35,480
nice thing they would then print it out

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,740
and then over line and word edit all

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,780
their stuff and find all the spelling

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,320
mistakes then go back and type it back

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:44,300
into the computer again I decided the

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,179
word processing was outside of my scope

00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,570
for training so I let that for the next

00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,570
guy

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:04,900
another good example are hopefully a

00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:09,520
good example another job site we had a

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:12,520
huge amount of compromised machines we

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,290
would compromise we would go in the

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,000
network leads to talk about how slow the

00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:18,520
computers were and how nothing was

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,750
working and the mouse is moving by

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:27,340
itself at times and stuff like that and

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:29,500
I went in we clean it up we go through

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,170
with the hazmat team clean out all the

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:37,720
systems set them all up and then a week

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:50,890
later actually day later or so they'd

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:53,680
all be bad again basically it got really

00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,510
bad at one point where somebody got an

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,930
email asking them to reset their

00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:01,290
password and so they happily sent their

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,550
old password to the administrator at

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:07,660
some place that wasn't or are placed

00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:09,400
because they said that in the email blah

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,730
blah blah has contracted out their

00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:20,520
support to us and your passwords have

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:23,170
been lost and we need to reset them and

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,330
we had a whole bunch of boxes that were

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,100
not up to date and all that kind of

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,070
stuff because it broke their various

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,740
business applications you updated South

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:35,110
Oracle wouldn't work he fixed it Oracle

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,670
wouldn't work if you got Oracle to fix

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:44,170
it than the other business app that

00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:46,510
relied on Oracle wouldn't work so we got

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,430
it all cleaned up we cleaned out the

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,020
backups because basically what had

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:54,220
happened is we had over trained our

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:57,130
users and backing up stuff and they

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,780
would restore from backup after we

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,049
cleaned up everything and they'd already

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:05,070
backed up all their back there

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:08,909
arms and viruses and compromise stuff

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,200
and run them again because they wanted

00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:14,700
the little happy cat that danced across

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:18,029
the screen we trained them not to do

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,710
that in a slow methodical method again

00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:23,460
using similar methods we broke it down

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:27,360
to tasks you know how to recognize bad

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:32,309
email how to ask us questions properly

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:36,570
if this emails work and basically again

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:44,269
we use the same slow quiet tone with

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:47,340
them i mellowed a lot by this time and

00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,649
then after about a month we sent them

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:56,669
out bad emails from out off-site took

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:58,350
place basically we sent out some spams

00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,210
and stuff like that and if they clicked

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,580
on the link it brought up a page ask him

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:07,309
to get reeducation recorded who had done

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,309
it so they couldn't say oh do it I

00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:12,779
people who sent us questions and said

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,129
well I got this email did you guys

00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:19,109
contract out to a website to do our

00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:23,549
technical support we'd give him a treat

00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:30,590
we gave him a USB keys I think which

00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:33,749
reminds me I got DSBs keys for later we

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:36,779
the ones who didn't tell us but we knew

00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:38,460
hadn't clicked on anything we gave him a

00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:41,100
reward of a different thing we go up the

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:44,909
quota a bit and told them that thank you

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,669
for following advice here you people who

00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:52,320
didn't and had gotten retrained had to

00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:54,899
go through Bay basically they got called

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,289
down to the office and talked to very

00:32:54,899 --> 00:33:01,859
slowly and clearly that clicking on

00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:06,139
things damaged their work prospects in

00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:08,850
the long run because it could cause

00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:10,919
significant damage to where we were

00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,710
working and

00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,539
we weren't in a happy mood about that

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,149
and we didn't do it ourselves we

00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:20,190
actually had physical security do this

00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:22,889
that works much better than of them

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:27,389
because these guys do look like they

00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:30,559
just came out of prison and they can

00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:34,590
talk that lingo and remind them that

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:39,019
certain aspects of what they do could

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,019
send you to the place they just came out

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,039
but so we spent this whole time doing

00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:49,019
this and we found various correlations

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,220
we found out the people who clicked on

00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,409
things were the same people who

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:59,909
complained the password changing wasn't

00:33:52,409 --> 00:34:04,049
useful skill we found that certain users

00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:05,580
who we knew we actually located some of

00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:08,069
our most troublesome users and put them

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:13,319
on a separate network just because it

00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:16,470
was easier in the long run to keep them

00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:18,659
in a clean pristine environment that was

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:27,960
completely their own that we could wipe

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:30,540
every day and put back in place I've

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,329
used ABA on I've seen my ba some of my

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,490
best managers use ABA a lot that we

00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:38,309
don't call it that and we don't use it

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,190
as humorously but I found it very useful

00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:44,309
in everything from training users to

00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:48,809
training myself because face it we are

00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:50,609
the worst users we have if there's a

00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:53,129
machine that is not going to be backed

00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:55,290
up or changed because the fact is we're

00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:58,530
worried that it will go down it's our

00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:00,140
own laptop or we have multiple copies

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:05,760
that we've kept all over the place and

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:08,819
forgotten where we put it oh we're very

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,859
interrupt driven so we rarely get

00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:14,549
anything done that we've told our bosses

00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:17,089
we're going to get done and they don't

00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:17,089
like that

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:24,329
so I myself involved I took a time

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,940
period where I broke down what I was

00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:29,160
needing to do every day I gave myself a

00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:32,280
small reward every time I completed it

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,980
and eventually after about a month I

00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:39,240
actually was on time for once on getting

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,190
my reports in and getting i also had

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,750
figured out how long a project really

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,670
was going to take me so I didn't say I

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,619
was going to do it I just get it done

00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:50,040
when it was done and not put it on my

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:57,450
annual review because those things count

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:59,819
it seems um my reward system is I

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,160
usually give myself 10 minutes of fuzzy

00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:05,010
cats online you know one of those cute

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:11,460
cat pictures or something something nice

00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:14,309
and relaxing something with you know or

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,410
kar komak you know Dilbert or something

00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:25,049
if it's friday i read the bastard

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:27,480
operator from hell on register but I I

00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:29,430
found that if I stuck to one bad habit

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,980
and I worked it I could work it out

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:38,880
pretty well I've had some backsliding

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:40,680
but it's worked pretty well the best

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,079
person who taught me these things was my

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,040
boss but my former job before i work at

00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,670
fedora he was a hypnotist that was it

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,799
been his entire career before this and

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:57,990
he was the best damn manager I have ever

00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:59,220
met you'd go into a meeting and at the

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:03,750
end of the meeting you were utterly

00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:06,869
convinced you could do this I showed up

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:10,950
on time I'm working at a university in a

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:18,329
basement under the sewage system I was

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:20,549
there every day happy and is he said he

00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:24,480
didn't like people in fact he hated

00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:28,619
people but he loved dogs and as long as

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,060
he treated people like dogs he got a he

00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,270
got along well

00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,410
and it was funny it worked I saw him

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:42,120
convince over a month our worst user are

00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:46,470
absolutely worse user to retire two

00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:49,340
years early because he absolutely you

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:52,440
know just calmly looking him in the eyes

00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,890
talking in a nice soft monotone voice it

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:59,370
sounds just like off the radio clearly

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:03,510
and succinctly and a nice almost

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:05,640
heartbeat rythm and eventually the user

00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,150
realized that nothing was going to ever

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,860
change the way they wanted it that

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,380
everything that they wanted to do was

00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:19,800
outside of the workplace and that they

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:23,880
needed to go there soon and they did and

00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:27,180
they were so happy afterwards everything

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,940
that they hated about the University not

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,680
a problem anymore I'm not there they

00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,290
actually came back as a contractor as a

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,530
happy person we got they were no longer

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:39,240
a troubled user because all the things

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,710
that they'd held against the university

00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,600
was no longer a problem because they

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,950
were a contractor they can walk out the

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,160
door they can walk in the dark they can

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:51,420
work out the colgate but the main thing

00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,710
though was if you are asus it bin become

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,740
a hypnotist take a couple courses in it

00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:00,840
learn how to stare them in the eye and

00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,400
just talk in a nice rhythm and you have

00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,260
to figure out that each user's rhythm is

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,640
one thing he told me because their heart

00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,130
rates are different you have to get to

00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,120
it but you have to get it down to their

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,070
heart rate and calm them down and make

00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:20,060
their brains clear and once you've done

00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:20,060
that you can get so far along and

00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,720
eventually as i was looking at this he

00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:28,530
was in how he did this part of the

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,350
hypnotism was he was using ABA and

00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:34,430
Skinner tests he broke everything down

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:37,740
he gave you a reward if you did it right

00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,660
he gave you a big reward and I big if

00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,190
you did it right fast give you a smaller

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,900
rewarded with swing but he always gave

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,440
you a reward and he tapered it off over

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,630
time

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,329
so that eventually I was just happy to

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:53,609
say when he said that's a good job I'd

00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:55,369
be like ah great and I I know that he

00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:58,890
hypnotized me the whole time I was there

00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:00,510
and that's why I liked him so much but

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,750
he's dead now so I can say that with a

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:10,589
whole thing and that ain't stuff but he

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:15,410
was uh it showed me quite clearly the

00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:17,700
how to win against your users in that

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:21,060
breaking things down for them and

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,550
talking in a way that is not menacing to

00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,849
them works much better than the normal

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:29,930
way of doing things although it's fun it

00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:32,700
doesn't get you at the end of the day

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:40,560
any further and eventually you get tired

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:44,970
of beating them I I think I'm about done

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:48,510
I have time for questions I do have a

00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,160
warning there is a group and you most of

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,490
your companies that already know all

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,810
this and they do it to you all the time

00:40:52,490 --> 00:41:00,270
you need to avoid them marketing if it's

00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:03,810
a good marketing group uses this on you

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:06,599
and everyone they know all the time the

00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:09,569
marketing at one place I worked at I was

00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,660
overwhelmed I couldn't get anything done

00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:15,930
I had 40 requests every morning to put

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,869
up new web pages clean out stuff change

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:21,480
links all this stuff and my manager was

00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:25,349
useless he said they're all important

00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,470
get them done figure it out yourself so

00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:32,839
I did I put up a sign saying orders will

00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,839
be done by amount of donuts

00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:44,490
and funny enough marketing has budget

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:47,520
and they gave me donuts a dozen krispy

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:50,100
kremes every morning I got it done they

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,080
are Jared jobs we're done they didn't

00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,530
have krispy kremes that morning they

00:41:52,080 --> 00:42:00,210
would mix it up I got him half dozen

00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:02,310
Bojangles biscuits or what was the other

00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,890
one they had for him one time they took

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,480
me out to dinner it wasn't great I mean

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,730
it was just down down the street to the

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,720
waffle house but you know for assisted

00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:16,170
minutes 8 9pm o'clock at night you know

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:22,050
Gus cheap t-bone steak is as good as

00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:24,300
anything and then the other group

00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:27,150
started learning this now I just got

00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:35,270
worse and worse to the point where i was

00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:39,990
at 239 pounds and my cholesterol was

00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:43,890
even higher it was somewhere in the 300s

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:48,450
and my triglycerides were one test dad

00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:50,610
to take over because it wrapped over it

00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:53,700
was bad my wife was really worried and

00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,800
my doctor said that if I whatever I was

00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:03,390
doing stop it now because I'd be dead

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:07,890
soon and I learned a horrible lesson I

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:12,180
left the job and marketing just started

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:14,280
training the next guy he got a dozen

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,550
krispy kreme doughnuts every day he got

00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,080
the same jobs done he left a year and a

00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:24,000
half later for the same reason but it

00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,310
was same thing they they they learned

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,630
rewards work really well and slight

00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:30,770
punishments if you don't do it right

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,770
work the same

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:43,750
you guys have any questions I have I

00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:48,200
have filled my quantity of 45 minutes

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:54,730
some of you are awake still lunch will

00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:59,270
be served somewhere they never told me

00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:02,270
see I got this I apologize for the

00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:14,570
roughness of this this is my first talk

00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:20,330
I've done in three years and I got it

00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:22,640
done it around what my dad kicked me out

00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:29,870
of the house last night I was working on

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:32,210
it still I this was humorous I am

00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:34,850
probably overly humorous this actually

00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:40,490
does work better than our usual methods

00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:42,650
and I can't overestimate over-emphasise

00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:47,600
for certain job places that are under an

00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:49,250
ISO 9000 or an ITIL filling out these

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,800
things can actually get you bonuses

00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:53,360
because no one else will do it and if

00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,270
you have things where you have labeled

00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,470
out and it may seem stupid I I didn't

00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:02,680
believe I was going to get a bonus for

00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:06,380
doing one for coffee but i did because

00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,910
as they put it people worth putting in

00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,500
three or four of those things at once

00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,820
into the bags and it was spilling all

00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,640
over they have to get the cleaning group

00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:21,020
in it was costing them a lot of money

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:27,250
and wasted coffee nobody wants that but

00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:27,250
otherwise any questions hello

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:51,590
whichever you like more most of my

00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:55,420
reading actually has been an intro to

00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:57,890
psychology course and a sociology course

00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,310
most your college level ones will have

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:03,980
it they go over the men main stuff thus

00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,230
hypnotism is usually better to be done

00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,960
by an expert versus something that you

00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,810
can read a lot of places have colleges

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,480
you need to investigate them the reason

00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:19,370
being is you can read it and do it wrong

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:26,090
or you can get you can read it and never

00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:29,510
do it right and you also have to be able

00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:33,050
to be a person who can do it now if you

00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:37,670
are a nice if you're able to stare at a

00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:40,370
computer screen for hours and find that

00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:44,330
one little comma that's off you can do

00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,800
it is how my boss said it because you

00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,880
have the concentration to do it it's

00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:54,550
basically a sink of Cinco fising but he

00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:57,590
said no reading most of the psychology

00:46:54,550 --> 00:47:00,890
I've picked up a lot of pop psychology

00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:04,340
but I think the best one I got out of

00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:09,500
books was my experiment was just a psych

00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:11,150
101 course if you really want to know

00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,420
more about the breaking down and better

00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,960
than what i put in ABA which is what

00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,960
this is called

00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:25,589
is what you if if you know anyone with

00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,180
children with autism it's a method

00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:33,440
that's used to teach children with

00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:36,569
autism in there it has a better

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,579
humanistic side of things and it's also

00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:41,099
how you train it I mean in many ways

00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:44,400
it's most what of most obedient schools

00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:46,890
are but the same thing with an autistic

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,239
child is an autistic child does not have

00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:53,130
the brain paths to do certain stuff and

00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,140
until they have done it through a hand

00:47:53,130 --> 00:48:02,180
over hand situation and you've broken it

00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:10,709
down and small enough parts and they're

00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:15,690
basically you have to prompt them and if

00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:17,549
you go to a lot of a do it even a look

00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:20,130
in your area look for an ABA training

00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:22,259
thing for autistic of our parents

00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,459
there's tons of them because it's a it's

00:48:22,259 --> 00:48:26,849
a method that works really great with

00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:30,779
autistics and to a lesser degree it

00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:37,609
works with humans I'm humans as a naught

00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:39,989
as I'm an autistic person so I'm I'm I'm

00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:41,339
that was supposed to be self deferential

00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:44,249
humor and then I realized that it

00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:50,400
doesn't come across that way to other

00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:54,599
people it works with users to to a

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,719
lesser degree because they are they may

00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:01,319
pick up things differently but I there's

00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:11,279
lots of material on this and I found it

00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:13,229
to be generally useful in stuff here and

00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:15,299
basically I mean there's lots of books

00:49:13,229 --> 00:49:18,390
that you'll read most of them are the

00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:21,059
same thing over and over again but

00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:22,949
that's it I'm sorry I couldn't get it

00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:25,579
any bigger for some reason this thing's

00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:25,579
all wacky

00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:39,930
but once this once you've done that

00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:52,200
you've pretty much picked up the general

00:49:39,930 --> 00:50:03,480
stuff anything else yes sir I like a

00:49:52,200 --> 00:50:07,259
Kenyan petes blend but it's a it's a

00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:10,619
blend that's dried out on leaves that

00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:14,400
are in Kenya and it gets a fruity flavor

00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:18,140
to it like a blackberry just a little

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:23,249
hint of it it depends on the year Kenyan

00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:25,230
yeah i get from pete PE ETS but you can

00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:29,460
get kenyan from various other things and

00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:30,960
depending on the year and the time and

00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:37,759
then it's a matter of how much you like

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:40,710
it roast it and that's tastes are very

00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:43,849
finicky about that anything else i'm

00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,849
down to lanyards

00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:09,400
yes yeah and it also works on the same

00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:11,079
thing of the same basic stuff you break

00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,230
it down and you give them a nice little

00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:16,450
happy face reward of some sort I'm not

00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,880
familiar that one exactly but I've seen

00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,309
one that will have a little little tiny

00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,690
it's like the if you go to the olpc desk

00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,950
over by the door and you see a little

00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,799
OPC and they have the little guy that

00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:30,150
talks you can type in words and he has a

00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:32,020
little you can get him to smile and

00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:36,280
honestly this little thing that will

00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:40,599
talk and say good job works great for

00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,369
users I don't want to over estimate but

00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:50,160
they'll will be fascinated by it and

00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:50,160
look up whoo I felt a toner in right

00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:55,390
again most of these things I tried to

00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:58,720
pick things that a lot some of us would

00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:00,430
deal with if you're dealing with remote

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,319
users and stuff you need to find

00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:08,200
different reward systems I find that

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:11,319
mailing them something is really good

00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:17,079
because they never get anything and if

00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:19,869
you give them a postcard it's it's not

00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:22,299
an immediate reward which is us downside

00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:23,770
but it does work you know that you send

00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:25,510
him a postcard from the office and say

00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:31,119
I'm really glad you filled out the

00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:33,039
paperwork on time good job and you'll

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:36,490
get bill though they'll fill it out

00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:39,150
properly from that on well maybe a

00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,150
couple more cards

00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:55,859
yeah I think it's time for lunch I think

00:52:51,390 --> 00:53:01,349
he's here to kick me off the stage I'm

00:52:55,859 --> 00:53:11,729
done I stretch I'm shaking so much up

00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:14,959
here I'm done thank you your money will

00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:14,959
be in the mail soon

00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:29,430
what about this I can help it like it we

00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,090
have the same problem what would happen

00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,090
if you do yours

00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:37,480
this

00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:39,540
let's put the word out

00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,540
you

00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,119
you

00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:54,059
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,650
all we do is hosted computing to us the

00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:57,599
cloud is just the next generation of

00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,549
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,589
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:02,670
we're in a unique position to really

00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,799
help bring these two worlds together

00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,140
these different sets of technologies and

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,450
to help companies embrace this new world

us being responsive and accountable but

00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:21,809
