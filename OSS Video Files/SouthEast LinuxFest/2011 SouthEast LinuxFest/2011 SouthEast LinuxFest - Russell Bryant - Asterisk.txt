00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:01:02,910
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:01:04,500
for helping make these videos cool well

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,810
thank you all very much for coming to

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,520
hear about asterisk so like you said my

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,130
name is Russell Bryant I'm the

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,170
engineering manager at Digium the

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,270
corporate sponsor of asterisk for the

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:23,460
asterisk development that goes on there

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:25,439
did you I just stand here there we go

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,829
okay so I've been working on asterisk

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,729
for since about two thousand four and in

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,650
the last year I've been doing water

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,689
writing about asterisk there's a couple

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,079
of O'Reilly books masters the definitive

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,909
guide and also a cookbook and both of

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,070
those are creative commons books that

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,689
you can get online there's another book

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,700
that i wrote a chapter for called

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,500
architecture of open source applications

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,909
that if you're interested in getting an

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,250
architectural overview of a bunch of a

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,720
bunch of different really interesting

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,220
open source projects i'd encourage you

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,170
to check that one out as i think 25

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,719
different projects covered there so

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,219
there's you know maybe like 10 pages on

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,649
asterisk and just a bunch of projects

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,119
it's really an interesting read that

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,540
one's also another creative commons book

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,310
you can read for free so we're not going

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,629
to talk about today i'm going to talk a

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,360
little bit about what's new so what are

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,680
the things we've done recently

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,730
in development land what's going to be

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,590
what's new in the next version of

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,490
asterisk and also I'm going to go

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,080
through a tutorial on building a custom

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,730
secure conferencing server so I'm hoping

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,560
that throughout these different things

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,570
regardless of your experience level with

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,770
asterisk whether you've just heard of it

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,900
or whether you have a lot of experience

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,190
using I hopefully have something new to

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,920
tell you that perhaps you haven't seen

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,300
so that's what I'm going to cover if you

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,100
have any questions any point feel free

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,530
to ask them in the middle I certainly

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,520
don't mind that at all and I expect it

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,780
will have time at the end as well so

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,870
asterisk one point 10 so that's the next

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,390
going to be the next version of Astros

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,100
were scheduled to be released in october

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:55,190
of this year so just a much too far away

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,260
for months or whatever it is and we plan

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,850
to do the first beta release in July

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,530
which if you look at the calendar isn't

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,440
too far away so we're actually really

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,090
close to done with developing all the

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,540
features that we have planned for that

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,140
one so an overview of what's new in

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,910
there we the first one there a media

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,170
handling infrastructure rewrite one of

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,820
the one of the biggest projects actually

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,010
we took on was one of these that i would

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,920
call paying back a lot of technical debt

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,450
you know we we there's a significant

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,580
area of our architecture that just was

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,190
limiting us on how we were able to move

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,220
forward and that was a lot of how we

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,540
handled media internally and so if you

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,250
think about a phone system it's you know

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,500
primary purpose is to handle phone calls

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,320
it's your handling of media is a pretty

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,459
critical component and in the reality is

00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,920
since Astra started in 1999 what media

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,110
is for calls has changed quite a bit

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,549
it's not just the plain old telephone

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,340
calls anymore there's there's a lot more

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,530
to it higher quality audio video

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,670
messaging and sort of course things so

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,500
we've done a lot of architecture work

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,090
and as a result we can support what we

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,390
do support a lot more codecs than we

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,870
have historically audio codecs and so

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,579
forth we have a new conferencing

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,440
application which I'm going to spend

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,380
most the talk today talking about

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,180
showing how to use it but asterisk has

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,520
had a conferencing application called

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,740
meet me that's been there for many many

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,500
years and we

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,240
a new one that blows it away in a lot of

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,000
ways t-38 facts gateway support so t-38

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,130
has to do with sending faxes over the

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,580
internet people will not give up their

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,430
fax machines for whatever reason so this

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,060
is sort of just the latest in that that

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:49,479
area another thing sort of related to

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,150
media or I guess asterisk has always

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,190
only been able to handle calls so so a

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,560
phone call with audio and so forth in

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,870
the next version we can handle routing

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,220
text messages so IMS through the same

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,539
routing platform through XMPP and sip at

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,389
least to start with we're going to have

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,740
skype in there as well and there's a lot

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,970
more smaller things there's a file

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,039
called changes that you can grab and

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,150
read all about them michael said i was

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,800
going to spend most the time talking

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,650
about the conferencing application which

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,030
is called conf bridge now there's the

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,979
application called conf bridge was

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:27,159
actually in the past couple of releases

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:28,990
asterisk 1.6 and asterisk 1.8 but we it

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:31,840
was very minimal a sort of is a pretty

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,009
bare for start at it and the main did

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,870
you know benefit that we got at that

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,770
point was that it wasn't dependent on

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,030
dotty so dotty is our kernel package of

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,219
primarily for adding hardware support

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,190
but it also includes a conference mixing

00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:47,949
engine in the colonel so we meet me

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,199
depends on that confer ish doesn't but

00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:54,639
it was didn't really have any features

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:57,159
at all so what we did in one point 10 we

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,900
have comfort which is mostly rewritten

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:02,819
but it one of the biggest things it

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,680
supports many more types of audio so not

00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,690
traditional telephony is fairly low

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,300
quality audio is an 8 kilohertz sampling

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,460
rate but the reality is now that we're

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,110
not as tied to the traditional telephone

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,569
network there's no reason to have your

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,240
audio quality tied to the limitations of

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:20,800
that old telephone network so we can now

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,130
do conferencing of much higher quality

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,080
audio it's also much more configurable

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,659
there's a lot of a cool ways that you

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,490
can add features to it and configure it

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:32,710
and we spend a lot of time on

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,020
performance at this one and some

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,970
comparisons against meet me it was

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,620
triple the performance on a pretty

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,330
I'm pretty weak who's like some single

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,250
core celeron box or something we were

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,870
doing this testing on but based on the

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,910
way Khan fridges designed it would

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,280
actually be a much higher impact if we

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,890
were to redo that testing on a multi CP

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,780
or at least a multi-core machine since

00:06:52,890 --> 00:07:02,520
it does a better job of pastry paralyzed

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,380
so so like I said it the new conference

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,420
bridges has a lot of interesting

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,520
configuration possible that you weren't

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,170
able to do before there's a

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,470
configuration file where you need to

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,900
find profiles related to the conference

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,640
bridge itself profiles for users joining

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,410
conference bridges that apply a bunch of

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,500
different options and also we can do

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,390
customized menus so in the older

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,250
iterations of conferencing support an

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,840
asterisk there's these incall menus you

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,890
did the star key and that some number

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,780
and lets you do things but all that's

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,450
very it's hard coded both what the

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,100
features do and what keys map to those

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,410
features were not anything you could

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,030
change but that you can completely

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:43,730
customize now that has some examples of

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:47,100
that coming later on in the tutorial so

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:49,560
we're going to build a customized secure

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,140
conferencing server using asterisk one

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,450
point in and the new clock bridge what

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,610
is our conferencing server going to

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,710
consist of we're going to set up both

00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,700
the client side in the server side the

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,590
server side is obviously going to be

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,560
asterisk I picked one particular client

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,930
that works for me and I'll show you how

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,270
to set it up we're going to use the the

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,730
newest conf bridge code and we're going

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,840
to use high higher quality audio the the

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:17,370
g7 22 codec in particular which is

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,890
higher quality than you get with a

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,590
traditional telephony we're going to use

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,060
encryption for for all the phone call

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,230
there's actually sort of two portions of

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,510
that the way so sip is the most popular

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,640
industry standard voice over IP protocol

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,950
and there's the SIP part that handles

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,710
call setup and there's media streams to

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,510
pass audio and so there's sip TLS using

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,380
just standard TLS to decrypt that part

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:47,070
in an SRT P stands for secure RTP so

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,900
it's encrypted media streams so we're

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,959
set that up and then we're going to look

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,610
a little bit at how you set up the

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,149
features and for the conference bridge

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,009
and how you could add some custom stuff

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,660
so step one you got to install asterisk

00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,800
at this point since we're using asterisk

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,180
one point in and we haven't even

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,529
released the first beta you got to grab

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,959
at a subversion if you were good today

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,779
so I went through this this whole thing

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,670
in its last week and so you know you

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,649
gotta check it out a subversion you

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,199
gotta build it what there's some notable

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,759
dependencies that are important openssl

00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,380
I mean that's going to be on virtually

00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,319
every system you know you probably

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,959
already have that lib srtp is not

00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:27,209
something you likely have so you have to

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,430
make sure you install that there's a

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:31,230
sort of a build configuration utility

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,920
included with Astra's called menu select

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,990
run that make sure that the secure RTP

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:43,860
module will be built because that will

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:47,399
be required and install it so there's a

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:51,240
really good tutorial for setting up

00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,709
encrypted phone calls on our wiki so my

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,540
tutorial covers a lot of the same things

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,430
but if you want a more detailed look I

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,290
just want to point to that Malcolm

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,639
Davenport wrote that one so give him

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,170
some props there so we're going to so

00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,790
now we've installed asterisk we need to

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:12,689
configure encrypted sip so sip TLS the

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,870
encrypted call setup in in my example

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:17,399
here I used us if you have experience

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,319
managing a certificate authority and

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,269
creating certificates than you do it

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,009
however you want if you want to just get

00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,339
it going we have a script included with

00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:29,069
asterisk that will help you out so I so

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,230
I go these commands are going into the

00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:33,240
asterisk directory running the command

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,399
that's going to both generate a

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,240
certificate authority and create one

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,790
certificate up with some some files

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,880
there but I wouldn't recommend going

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,290
this route except for sort of your own

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,519
prototyping purposes you know do the

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:52,319
real deal if you're setting up a

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,720
production system we have to enable TLS

00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:57,569
in the sip configuration of asterisk so

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,440
an asterisk all the configuration lives

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,480
in the

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,870
see a store directory there's a file

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,030
called sitcom which is all of your

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,390
configuration related to sip dinner

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:13,710
enable TLS i set the bind address to

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:18,380
colon colon which means any ipv4 or ipv6

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:21,450
address on the system Astra support ipv6

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,000
point to the certificate a server

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,210
certificate point to this certificate

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,690
authority cert a couple more options so

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:33,960
you just drop that in as it is we need

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:37,260
to add an account so if this is a fresh

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,090
installation you have to add I'd account

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,350
for a sip phone for a phone be able to

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,720
call in so you'd have to add one of

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,630
these per client that you were setting

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:51,990
up but this is one that I added for my

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:54,840
demo here it's you well you do click you

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,940
have to put in a password it's not a

00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,280
there's not a specific IP address host

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,140
is dynamic so that means that this could

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,820
be so I have had it installed in my

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,680
laptop's my laptop can be anywhere and

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,980
it's going to connect asterisk from

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:14,160
wherever it is and some parameters

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:16,170
related to the way it sends DTMF another

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,080
I guess important the most important

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,740
things here are these three down here so

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,200
allow a g7 22 I'm saying that I want the

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,150
for this account to use that audio codec

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,790
that's the high quality or higher

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:35,520
quality audio yes question so the

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:40,770
question was is G 722 a variable bitrate

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,230
codec it well it it does actually

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,360
support to bit rates and practice only

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,190
one of them has ever used so I think we

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,220
only use one of its it's the same bit

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,210
rate as moolah or a law so it's 64

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,810
kilobits per second but double the

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,810
sampling rate so it's

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,870
okay I haven't read what what you're

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,450
talking about so what he was saying was

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,029
there he's heard of some weaknesses with

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,150
certain audio codecs where you can based

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:25,410
on I guess the amount of bandwidth being

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:28,440
consumed sure sure so so g 7 22 is a

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,630
constant bitrate codec so it's a 60 it's

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,180
a 64 kilobit stream constantly so does

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,550
medicine apply transport equals TLS

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,470
where cific alee saying that we only

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,350
want this client to connect over an

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,210
encrypted signaling method encryption

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,220
equals yes seems sort of redundant but

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,680
actually that's for as the media streams

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,180
part so we're saying the signaling must

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,740
be encrypted the media must be encrypted

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,240
setting up a sip client so to the client

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,130
side we were looking at the server side

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,250
now they're gonna set up a client the

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,660
one I played with or and I use this one

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,700
quite a lot because I like it that's

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,660
called blink it's open source you can

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,000
find it at I can blink calm sports linux

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:14,089
mac and windows I think it's awesome so

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,350
and it does support TLS and srtp and

00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:18,030
sports a lot of lot of cool stuff so

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,040
it's a soft it's my softphone of choice

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,339
these days but there's there plenty of

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,950
others out there so you got an add an

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,710
account adding an account in a softphone

00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,990
in some of them in the configuration is

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,630
quite complex and this one it's as

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,580
simple as it can get you add a sip

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,920
address so in this case I have Russell

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,890
conf orange demo at Russell Bryant Matt

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,240
and then a password and that's that's

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,560
that's it for the base configuration

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,050
there's a couple more things we're going

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,050
to have to set for encryption purposes

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,650
so we have to this one this is a little

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,880
bit of a hack but you know if you when

00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,320
you're when i was first when i was first

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,260
saying this up I didn't have the

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,330
appropriate records in DNS so when my

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,250
account is you know Russell at Russell

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,440
Bryant net it has

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,730
no what server to go to when it's

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,680
sending a phone call to the domain

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,410
Russell Bryant net it finds that

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,410
information in DNS using an SRV record

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,350
and I have those there but I put them in

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,430
DNS and stay down setting this up so

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,890
hype set they have to set this option

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,920
here so i had to explicitly say when

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,860
calling russell Bryant net you connect

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,140
to the server PBX Russell brunette on a

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,120
particular port and then there's also a

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,860
parameter saying use the transport TLS

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,620
because there's multiple transports that

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,810
could be used so set an option here

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,010
getting it to sort of hard-coding the

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,690
fact that it's going to talk to this

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:48,480
particular server using this particular

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:51,690
transport one more thing there's a go to

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,430
the RTP area of settings and enabled

00:15:51,690 --> 00:16:02,250
srtp encryption that's disabled by

00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:05,640
default set it's a mandatory so no srtp

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:09,540
does not so the way it works is it uses

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:12,990
certificates to to set up a TLS session

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,500
for this the the sip signaling so the

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,120
call setup part and the negotiation for

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,370
the media stream is done in the

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,860
signaling stream so as it negotiates the

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,890
call it's also doing key exchange inside

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,380
of those messages so that's all

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:31,860
automatic yeah and the idea is since the

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:36,180
sip messages are encrypted it just does

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:38,760
some sort of case change there and yeah

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,130
so no configure there's no configuration

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,170
there's no keys the only configuration

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,690
is on this side you have to say use it

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:50,190
and on the asterisk beside you say use

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:52,050
it the encryption equals yes part so we

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,660
have to make sure that our client has

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,620
connected so to back up we installed

00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:02,510
asterisk we configured we added the sip

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:05,010
account we enabled sip TLS i created my

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,660
blink again i count in the blanks off

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,430
phone and i'm going to just go to the

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,770
Astros command-line interface and verify

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:13,800
it connected I do want to run this

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,920
command sip show pier it'll spit out a

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,990
bunch of stuff the most important one is

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,240
this one to look at

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,730
and it tells you the IP address and port

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,300
number that the sip client has connected

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,940
from so if it has not connected astris

00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,500
that would be blank or it would say

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,530
unknown or something it wouldn't say an

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,660
IP address and it also knows what client

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,490
particular application connected so put

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,290
that there to it knows it was blank that

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:44,300
is connected so that showed that the

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,670
client was successfully configured and

00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,640
has connected asterisk so now we've got

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,470
to now we've got to create some things

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,600
in asterisk for the clients in some

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:57,800
calls to so this is the first thing that

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I created here this screen is kind of

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:05,300
small so I apologize if you can't if you

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:07,309
can read it but this this this is a

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,710
asterisk dialplan this is where you

00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:13,040
create it's sort of where you script

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,450
handling of a phone call this is so

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,370
there's four things that happen here

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,230
there's an answer there's a couple of no

00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,030
ops which don't actually do anything and

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,010
then echo which means it's going to

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,070
repeat back all the audio I send Astros

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:28,429
back but these couple of no ops there's

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,550
some logic going on here to print out

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:34,130
from the Astros console whether the call

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:39,380
that has come in is secure or not so the

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:41,320
secure signaling and secure media so and

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,600
you have to tell it to reload the

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,580
routing configuration and gonna make a

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,940
call to asterisk so when you make a call

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,320
in this is some stuff some verbose stop

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,650
being printed out on the console to show

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,980
you the call is hitting the stuff we

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:02,780
just added to our dial plan it's

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,520
answering these it's showing what runs

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,790
this no wap application which doesn't do

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,190
anything except for it allows us to get

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,620
some stuff printed out so the logic

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,900
determined that the signaling secure

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,600
signaling evaluated its yes secure media

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,610
evaluated yes and they're decos so you

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,929
talk to yourself but it's always a good

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,760
first test to do an echo test so all

00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,309
right so we've got we got asterisk

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,020
installed we've got a client installed

00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,580
that can successfully make encrypted

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,810
phone calls to asterisk

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:38,800
so now we have to do the conferencing

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:40,910
part so we jump over to the conf bridge

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,820
configuration file called conf bridge

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,770
conf mentioned before the way you

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,360
configure conf bridge you create

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,300
profiles in there so the first thing we

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,680
have to create is a bridge profile and i

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,960
called it creatively my bridge and the

00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,860
only option i set is record conference

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,300
equals yes so anytime people call in to

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,410
this conference to talk to each other it

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,660
automatically gets recorded we have to

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,060
create user profiles i created to use

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,730
user profiles here there's a base user

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,290
and then the second one here is an

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,660
administrator called that you know admin

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,850
user and this is means it inherits from

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,960
base user and just adds additional

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,940
option admin equals yes so I set a

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,610
number of options here for free this in

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,530
this User Profile first one music on

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,030
hold when empty so if you're the only

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,900
person in the conference you get to hear

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:38,420
music announce user count as people join

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,110
it or it's going to tell you there are

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,540
now three people in conference and now

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,920
it's only user it tells you explicitly

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,460
when you join you're the only person

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,560
it's just a different prompted plays DSP

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,080
drop silence is part of the performance

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,150
work that we've done it's one of the

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,000
optimizations done it's detecting when

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,610
if a particular caller is not talking

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,200
then there's no value and processing its

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,120
media and mixing it into the conference

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,040
so it's just it's waiting for someone to

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,090
start talking before it starts mixing

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,130
that audio in so that is a big

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,750
performance bump I think it's on by

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,190
default I don't know why you'd ever turn

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,840
it off unless you had too many callers

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,410
that spoke really quietly or something

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,370
but you can't turn it off but talk

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,440
detection events as a part of the

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,610
optimization you can also get notified

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,050
via a management interface that

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,130
different people start talking know

00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:40,070
which is good if you're building an

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:43,430
application perhaps outside of Astros de

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:46,450
manage conferences denoise so and that

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:51,320
does automatic noise cancel

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:53,360
okay another configuration bit so I

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,720
mentioned before and meet me you

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,610
configure well excuse me and meet me you

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,560
can't configure the menus so the when

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,270
you when you're going to on a conference

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,950
call the stuff in when you press keys

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,170
and do features that's all hard-coded

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,940
built-in and conf bridge it's entirely

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,200
configurable so this is a this is a menu

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,640
that's similar to what you would have

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,840
and meet me but it's from the

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:20,510
configuration file and it's and it's

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,170
syntax is effectively a key sequence and

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:26,240
then some action so the first one when

00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:29,510
so impress is the star key it says

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,160
playback and continue so if so impressed

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,690
are key it's going to play a particular

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,150
prompt that tells you what options you

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:40,490
have available to you press four to

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:43,820
decrease volume all these things so you

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,050
can press star and then a number to get

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,400
a feature or you can just press the

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,630
number the way it's configured or you

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,090
can just press the number directly and

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:53,930
skip the prompt playback part in

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,700
executor feature so if you want to swap

00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,820
around features only enable certain ones

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:03,710
for some users etc you have the power to

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:06,800
do so i'm going to create a second menu

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:09,140
for an administrator it inherits from

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,090
this base menu from the last slide it

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,850
just adds it plays a different prompt

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,080
and it adds a couple more actions some

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,490
administrative things you can kick

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,110
people out of the conference or prevent

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,580
more people from joining that's with

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:23,990
those a couple of things do okay so we

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,640
created all the stuff all the

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,530
configuration for a conference bridge

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,570
now we have to go back to the call

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,120
handling file which is extensions comp

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,440
and create a couple of extensions to

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,630
call in to our native conference which

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,830
we just created so I created a couple

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,600
different things there's conference user

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,670
and conferred admin so I could test out

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,740
calling as a regular user or calling as

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:47,480
an administrator and for each one its

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,030
conference conference bridge one two

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,310
three four five they both use the same

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,010
bridge profile which just turned on

00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,900
conference recording the next section is

00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,290
the

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:01,810
user profile so the regular user uses

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,520
this base user profile the if you call

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,050
in to the administrator version uses the

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,670
admin user profile which marks the

00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,280
person as that administrators they can

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:12,940
perform additional actions and the last

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,560
option is the menu so this if you call

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,300
in this way you get the regular users

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,770
menu or this way you get an

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:24,670
administrator's menu so that's our

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,380
custom conference there um something you

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:30,100
got to call it so it blinked the way you

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,450
make a call and I guess keep in mind you

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,820
know you're not restricted to calling

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,160
numbers so as you saw like the number is

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,860
actually conf bridge user so you just

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,900
type it in this box hit enter a little

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,540
slider comes out lists all your active

00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,580
calls this particular one is a call to

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,390
conference excuse me cough bridge user

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:52,120
at Russell Bryant net and I had a

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:56,080
conference with myself and my wife

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,080
looked at me funny so I think that's

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,020
what blank looks like by your own call

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,610
ok so the custom many features so what I

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,950
guess one of the things that I really

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,800
really like about the customized menus

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,110
is an action that you can that you can

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,260
do called dialplan exact so you map a

00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,660
key sequence to dial plan exec something

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,760
in the dial plan so that means from a

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,340
conference you press a key and it can

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,130
run anything you want that can be either

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,800
the dialplan code or go off to any

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:29,920
scripting language of your choice and do

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,410
whatever you want which is which is

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,890
pretty cool and one and to demonstrate

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:38,140
that I wrote a feature call for doing

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,280
outbound calls from a conference so if

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,840
you're on a conference call and you're

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,940
like you know it'll be really great if

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,680
you know Mark Michaelson was here

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,680
because he sure knows a lot about this

00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,900
particular topic then I just hit the

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,790
feature code and type in a cell phone

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,190
number then asterisk makes a call to him

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,830
and connects them into the conference so

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,550
we're going to going to show you how you

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:02,740
would add that feature to clock bridge

00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,960
it actually works too so this is this is

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,630
all it took in the title plan i created

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,309
this this one extension here when it

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,529
starts it plays back up beeps

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:13,360
down just so that I know that when I

00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:15,370
press the keys to activate the feature

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,110
that it worked so it gives me some

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,419
feedback then it's going to wait for me

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,330
to type in a number and then it

00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:24,220
originates a call so it's going to beep

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,889
at me and type in mark cell phone number

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,120
I hit pound to tell it i'm done and then

00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:35,639
it goes off it makes a phone call and

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:39,970
connects it to the conf bridge demo

00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:42,850
extension so excuse me the conference

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,919
demo context that in connect it

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,360
basically connects his call to

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:51,700
conference user which is what we set up

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:55,059
a little while ago and back in the conf

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,769
bridge configuration just going to add a

00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,200
couple more things to the administrators

00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:02,559
menu only want administrators to to make

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,559
more calls so I added if they do star

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,789
five or just press five it goes off and

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,720
execute that custom feature i just made

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:13,779
there are probably some more things you

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,789
could do if you didn't if you wanted to

00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,470
have call recording on demand that being

00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:19,899
used to do with custom feature like that

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:22,090
if you wanted to have a silly sound

00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:24,129
board that you can you know just

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,779
anything that you can do in dial plan

00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:28,419
which is pretty much anything you can

00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,769
write a program for you could interview

00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:33,610
could connect to a conference to that

00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:35,379
way so it's pretty neat so in recap so

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,659
what i would have covered was some new

00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:40,840
stuff in one point 10 and then I blasted

00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:43,749
through a tutorial on setting up a new

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:47,379
conference server using encryption for

00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:48,940
your voice over IP calls in with that I

00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:51,519
am more than happy to take any questions

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,899
on any whether anything I've talked

00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:58,980
about or anything about asterisk in

00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:58,980
general yes question

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,990
so the question was are the conferred

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,309
features I've talked about are they only

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,890
going to be present in asterisk one

00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:13,750
point in or where they exist in any

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,370
earlier versions and the answer is

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,720
they're only going to exist in one point

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:21,130
10 release that's the plants right now I

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,390
yeah well I guess it's only software we

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,799
could backport it but we don't have any

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,429
plans to it's still one point in

00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:30,100
specific thing in parts of that are

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:31,539
dependent upon a lot of our meteor

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,649
architecture improvements that we've

00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:34,590
done at one point in as well so it

00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:43,690
actually be fairly difficult to back for

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:45,700
question read there so the question was

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,470
for the conference recording feature is

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,059
it just one recording for the conference

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,519
as a whole or is there some additional

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:56,110
information you can know about which

00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:58,330
witch who was too I get who was what so

00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,590
the built-in recording is the conference

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,330
of a whole and you don't have any

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,750
information beyond it's just like a you

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,460
know way a file on disk right if you

00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,510
instead of if you wanted to have

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,889
separate recordings of each

00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,750
participant's and associate them

00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:13,120
together you can do that it wouldn't be

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,889
using the built-in feature you would you

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,570
would enable recording on each caller

00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:18,269
individually instead of the conference

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,799
bridge itself and you would get

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:22,899
recordings for each person and you can

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,830
even have it yeah so you can do that it

00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,600
would just be a more complex

00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,450
configuration but all the tools to make

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,490
that happen or are there let's sort of

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,600
answer this question I don't know

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:38,850
the question was to the conference work

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,169
for video calls no doesn't yeah I I

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,789
could go on a spiel but yeah we're going

00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:44,669
to do that one thing I really want to

00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:48,530
which 17 so doesn't it doesn't exist yet

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:50,880
I guess one of the but i will say that

00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,140
better video so you can make video calls

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,460
with asterisk but it's like

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,510
point-to-point right so but getting

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,390
further than that one of the

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,220
prerequisites was man the way we handle

00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,159
it media and asterisk is very audience

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,860
is very very specific and a lot of areas

00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,179
the video edition was a bit of a hack we

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,070
just got to go redo all that and we've

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:13,919
done that now so we've done a lot of the

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:16,830
prerequisites to now we can finally go

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,600
back and make video support much much

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,890
better and that's probably like that's

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,030
going to be on our list for the next

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,500
next go-around so we can add we've done

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,570
all the prerequisites now we can add

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,850
video transcoding support so that's been

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,900
a problem with video is because you know

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,610
different people different types of

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,710
video clients using different video

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,909
codecs if they don't negotiate if

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,789
they're not using the same thing that

00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:41,340
just doesn't work but now that we've

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:42,929
done a lot of the infrastructure work we

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,880
can add video transcoding support fairly

00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,250
easily at least from a software

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,900
perspective how many video transcoding

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,710
sessions you can actually handle in your

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:54,720
box is a whole other problem but in but

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,520
we can add video transcoding which is

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,890
actually going to that's required to do

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,840
video conferencing because typically

00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,720
what people expect is you need to be

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,669
able to do people call on you stitch

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,440
them together right so you have like you

00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,620
see like the four people in there at

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,679
least that's that's what it would be or

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,080
you can also do things like only you

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,659
show the person who's currently talking

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,100
but that it's easier to implement but in

00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,059
practice people will actually like that

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,090
very much it's actually kind of

00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,950
distracting you know the screen just

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,049
keeps changing like crazy on you and

00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,900
it's much more pleasant to just look at

00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:31,890
the group of people all the same time

00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,480
but to do that we have to have the

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,070
ability to manipulate video streams

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,860
which we just were pretty far away from

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,950
in the past but we're much closer now so

00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,169
short back to this the question no we

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,200
cannot do video conferencing yet luckily

00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:46,000
we've done lots of

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,250
structure work to make it so that much

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,889
closer to being able to at it I'd like

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,049
to be able to say we can be able to have

00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:55,269
it in the next release but we'll see

00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:56,769
what the priorities turn out to be yeah

00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,000
it's it's certainly I will see maybe

00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:59,950
that's maybe that could be what I talk

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,279
about next year but no you know how to

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:06,220
get all right any other questions about

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:12,580
anything about asterisk or not about

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:16,929
asterisk I guess about dinner cool what

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,760
okay question slides available I think

00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:20,500
Jeremy who's the speaker coordinator for

00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,820
self said he's going he's going to be

00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,559
collecting all the slides and I assume

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,070
posting them somewhere so I certainly

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,809
will be giving him these also fulfilled

00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,960
you email me for some reason you can't

00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:35,500
find them I don't mind sharing I can put

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,580
up on the interwebs somewhere so but I

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,580
don't haven't posted anywhere just yet

00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,779
no it's at the conference this tutorial

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,580
I it only exists in the sides at the

00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:51,320
moment it probably a good thing to put

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,559
on our wiki has haven't done it but so

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,359
right now it's just in the slides please

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,669
do oh cool i'm glad you found it useful

00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,859
well thank you all very much for coming

00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:10,070
I appreciate your attention and interest

00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:25,299
oh I got on the question more yeah Club

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:28,190
crap okay so the question was you know

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:31,220
the cloud is all the rage so you know

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:35,029
how about a prebuilt image with all this

00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,519
stuff set up yeah I guess it's

00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,350
technically possible I I can certainly

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,659
provide the configuration files that

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,639
would get you a long way there I don't

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:45,679
know if I can commit to having the time

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:48,019
to put it to put together an image and I

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,700
don't know where I host it anyway but

00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,049
I'd be happy to provide configuration

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,090
files that were built along with the

00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,019
tutorial and that'll get you at least a

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:59,359
good way there digium does produce a

00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:02,389
it's really it's a recent toss rebranded

00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,039
so it's it's cintas with a young

00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:07,100
repository that we manage that has

00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,470
asterisk among other things in it and we

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,210
release an iso that has all that set up

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,589
that makes it pretty quick and easy to

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,879
get asterisk up installed if you don't

00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:19,059
feel like installing manually but he's

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,059
questioning back

00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:27,129
oh I had a please pass along thanks to

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,109
whoever pass along the whoever's making

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,510
the Debian packages I'll certainly do so

00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:34,000
the Debian packages so we've been making

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,649
RPM packages for asterisk for some

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,300
number of years now and we just started

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:41,109
making dead packages for debian and

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:44,139
ubuntu in the last few months the person

00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:46,450
doing the work is paul boulanger i'll

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:48,220
let him know he will be happy to hear it

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,990
he was excited to be able to do the

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,230
project and it seems to be well received

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,730
so glad you liked it too all right well

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,169
thanks again if you want to come up and

00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,770
talk about anything no problem at all

00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:58,770
thanks you very much

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,860
you

00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,050
what about this I can help the like it

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:24,200
we have the same problem applicable to

00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,200
do lyrics like this

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,720
let's put the word out

00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,720
you

00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:43,349
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,940
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,859
cloud is just the next generation of

00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,839
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:51,000
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,500
work in a unique position to really help

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,510
bring these two worlds together these

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,700
different sets of technologies and to

00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,099
help companies embrace this new world in

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,410
this great new tool that allows faster

00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,450
innovation not only is it about us being

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:09,930
responsive and accountable but it's

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:12,569
about us doing more for you webos an OS

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:19,279
that works the way that you do across

00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:19,279
