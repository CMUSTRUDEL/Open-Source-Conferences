the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,900
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,400

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,060
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,210
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,980
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,540
make these videos possible hey ask any

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,610
questions along the way don't hold them

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,840
till the end the whole notion is to try

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,190
and make this something that's relevant

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,010
for you I speak all the time I guess

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,320
this is okay if you can't hear me just

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,300
let me know I speak all the time on a

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,930
variety of topics related to Linux and

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,860
intellectual property and I run

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,300
something I'll give you some background

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,710
just so you have a better understanding

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,719
of the context in which I operate and

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,439
what I do and then that will help you

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,439
understand how we're attempting to

00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,970
leverage the wonderfully elegant

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,240
self-organizing self-regulating entity

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,390
that is the Linux community if you study

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,200
complexity theory as I have it's a it's

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,850
it's it's amazing to have to be working

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,710
in this environment and be supporting

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,860
and attempting to enable the community

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,340
which is really all that I do the whole

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,750
notion is to be as as egoless as

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,030
possible it's a time and place event but

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,240
about eight years ago companies like IBM

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,310
and redhat recognized that that there's

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,140
an inherent vulnerability associated

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,740
with with open source and with Linux and

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,869
I think they recognized that with all

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,090
this openness came the opportunities for

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,420
mischief for those who don't necessarily

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,310
support openness and creativity and

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,899
innovativeness in the way that can be

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,420
developed the discontinuities

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,850
discontinuous innovation that's truly

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,759
impactful that can come about from open

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,410
source collaboration those companies

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,080
that were very happy with the status quo

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,930
and still are and struggle to

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,290
to avoid the inevitable and have not

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,030
developed open source strategies don't

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,700
understand how to operate an open source

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,940
world those entities at that time we're

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,930
starting to look at this as an anomaly

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:33,030
and in fact if you look at the the

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:36,360
quotes that are often trotted out about

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,910
personal computing in the early 70s by

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,380
IBM errs about it being somewhat of a

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,770
novelty and something that would never

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,620
really expand and be have any real

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,340
traction in the in the world you look at

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,350
Bill Gates's quotes in the in 99 and 98

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,230
about open source and about Linux and

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,740
their eerily similar I think with that

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,180
the lesson there is that the more the

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,640
more successful you are the more

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,340
sedentary become and your perspective

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,380
and how the more difficult it is to be

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,300
able to break the frame of reference to

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:16,070
be able to allow you to reap receive the

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:19,290
future or the present in his case and so

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,910
those companies that were in tagging

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,269
istic to Linux that still are

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,390
antagonistic to Linux decided on an ad

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,330
hoc basis that they would look to fund

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:33,330
litigation by third-party entities and

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,340
so the schoo lawsuit from the early part

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,370
of the last decade was a wake-up call to

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,760
large companies and even though at that

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,870
point if you look at the in the 92 93 94

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,870
or 03 04 05 timeframe the number of

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,190
developers inside large companies versus

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,470
outside large companies was

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,209
disproportionately outside large

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,580
companies now if you look at the latest

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,620
Linux Foundation data I think the

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,900
numbers up around sixty-eight percent of

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,560
developers that are coding and

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,269
developing in support of Linux not all

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,489
of open source which is Linux are

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,850
actually inside medium to large

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,640
companies and so there's been a shift

00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,739
and and these companies like IBM in

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,830
particular recognized in 99 when they

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,169
first billion dollar investment in an

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,250
open source and in Linux that this was

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,590
coming and it was gonna be very

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,090
important and it was significant because

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,570
it creates

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,280
an opportunity for the for societal

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,710
benefit to accrue in a way that had

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,010
never occurred before the whole idea of

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:42,900
if you look at the work of Ken arrow and

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:46,080
brian arthur at at stanford they're both

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,229
alive ken arrows quite old brian arthur

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,020
is not quite all as old but an

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,030
interesting guy they developed the whole

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,600
notion of increasing returns which is

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,880
the economic base of where we're network

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,310
effects come from which we kind of tend

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,380
to call for short hair network affects

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,570
the value creation of one plus one plus

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,729
one doesn't equal three anymore when you

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,840
bring smart people together around a

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:16,440
problem or a project and allow them to

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,880
be creative loop lat who ran HP for

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,860
about 15 years his notion of this was

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,320
inside a company which was a more

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,210
limited model was that you bring a bunch

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,760
of people hire a bunch of smart people

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,130
put them in a room and hope they mate

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,870
and it's a crude way of describing the

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,850
creativity and innovative prot

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,660
innovation process but and I think it

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,820
gets the point across that you you have

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,039
people when you bring people together

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,860
whether it's over a network or its face

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,950
to face you create an opportunity for

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,080
new novel to be created which is really

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,330
what drives an economy incremental

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,030
innovation new versioning of an old

00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,229
platform is not necessarily where we see

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,470
major shifts in economic growth and

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:07,080
echinacea having worked as a diplomat

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,910
for a dozen years and and been involved

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,700
in the administration of aid programs I

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,210
can tell you that there's a fundamental

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:18,330
problem with aid this is a program a

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,460
source in general is a societal social

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,099
shift that actually allows for people to

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,570
engage globally and for the world to be

00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,550
connected so that we don't have the

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,910
inefficient use of capital and siloed

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,280
organizations and redundant production

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,800
of technology but rather through

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,229
collaboration we've broken down a lot of

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,690
the concerns that existed in the 60s and

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,740
70s where companies were afraid to even

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,220
talk to themselves

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,380
because of the fear of reprisal from the

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,880
Justice Department for undo

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,259
collaboration and and behaviors it would

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,810
be detrimental from an antitrust

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,060
standpoint to the two consuming

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,370
population and I think as we've gotten

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,250
over that hump we've now created an

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,889
opportunity for this social dynamic to

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,569
to pertain which is it's really really

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,340
important that I think it is a social

00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,770
dynamic because it's not something

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,449
that's that's reversible much as

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,460
companies that are supporting

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,319
proprietary platforms would like it to

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,979
be a peer technology that could be

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,360
displaced by an alternative technology

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:23,580
Linux is not about that and open source

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,039
is not about that which is why it's so

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,319
seductive and so powerful and why it

00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,530
represents it white we are now in a

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,690
transition point going from again that

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,970
inefficient use of capital where control

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,889
of capital and ideas and innovation

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,449
really were with the g8 company

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,729
companies that existed in the g8

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,520
countries to now much more global

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,840
engagement so that the smartest of smart

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,150
people around the world get to

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,030
participate around these platforms and

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,780
contribute and it allows for all kinds

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,430
of other dynamics in terms of the

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,380
localization of products there's a was a

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,409
term in the technology industry in the

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,840
late 90s called software definable radio

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:06,150
where devices became an extension of us

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,340
it was a vision that we are finally

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,069
starting to realize with with

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,289
smartphones and we'll the ultimate

00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,349
culmination of that vision will only be

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:18,509
brought forward by open source where

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:20,699
devices will ultimately be customized in

00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:24,060
in local environments so that they're

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:26,810
uniquely utilitarian for people who

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,030
speak certain languages or dialects or

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,370
utilize information in certain ways but

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,010
the device itself the hardware becomes

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:40,529
only a vessel to be manipulated and to

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:43,020
be co-opted to be more more suited to

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,450
work and play in regions around the

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,820
world by people depending upon their

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:53,070
particular predispositions nationalities

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,630
identity and language and so nine years

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,790
ago eight years ago

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,380
IBM and Red Hat got together and said

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,330
we're going to have to do something

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,940
extraordinary because we can't let

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,790
nature take its course because this is

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,460
too powerful force for the likes of

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,560
large companies to that support

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,500
proprietary platforms to allow to

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,990
continue unabated and the schoo lawsuit

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,540
where funding came from Microsoft to

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,960
support litigation by a third party

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,420
company was something that again was a

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,160
wake-up call for them and so what they

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,840
said is let's get together with a bunch

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,620
of other companies and do something

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,140
that's completely selfless if you think

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,530
about Intel strategy historically from

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,220
the mid-80s onward Intel was never that

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,170
concerned about AMD if AMD didn't exist

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,470
they would have had to create them so

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,600
AMD was was helpful in that they allowed

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:53,490
them to escape the bright spotlight of

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,430
ana trustee for a long time but Intel

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,890
was always concerned with create the

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,290
market more devices that that was their

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,620
mantra whenever I would meet with them

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:07,170
on a bilateral basis in Washington or in

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,030
in Silicon Valley or in Tokyo or Paris

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,740
or wherever else I was in the world

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,110
working on it from a governmental

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,120
standpoint the whole message with them

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,950
is let's just get more devices in

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,890
people's hands we need more penetration

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:22,170
of PCs we need more mobile devices out

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,310
in the world and then we're comfortable

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,950
that we're going to be able to compete

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,090
for our part of that of the pie

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,770
sometimes they're correct is they have

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,560
been in the PC space where they've never

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,860
had less than fifty six percent market

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,770
share in any generation hasn't turned

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,190
out so well for them in the in the hit

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:44,130
the handheld space but but in balance

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:47,190
what they saw is what the people at IBM

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,710
and and red hat and then Sony and NEC in

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,300
Phillips and novell they all recognize

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,960
that they had to contribute real money

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,480
to allow for this wonderfully

00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,850
wonderfully as I said self-organizing

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,550
self-regulating community that has

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,160
neither head nor tail to actually have a

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,080
surrogate for what normally exists in a

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,279
individual company that represents a

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,560
technology movement

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:14,519
which is a patent portfolio that allows

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,170
for date on to be maintained so the

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,749
challenge was how do we build a

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,149
sufficient patent portfolio that allows

00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:23,550
us to utilize that portfolio for

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,639
defensive purposes to keep large

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,189
companies who are antagonistic to Linux

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,899
and antagonistic to the kind of

00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:33,439
creativity and innovation that linux and

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:37,309
open source can generate how do we

00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:40,439
basically keep them in check so that

00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:44,009
their behaviors are ones that are not

00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:45,839
able to rob people and vendors of choice

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,059
which is really what I do on a daily

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,709
basis I just make sure that this choice

00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,360
out there what I had is open and

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,269
mentioned network and it was the result

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,999
of that eight year ago nine year ago

00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,740
brain store between red hat and IBM and

00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,329
then they brought in these other players

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,959
they contributed tens of billions of

00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:05,990
dollars on day one to this and there's a

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,490
light commitment this is a very unusual

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,439
there's no precedent for open invention

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:15,059
networks existence it's not an industry

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:16,920
association it represents a community I

00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,990
have six board members the companies

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,050
that i mentioned sit on my board but i

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,850
don't do anything directly for them

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,730
which is very unusual they put all the

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,410
money in but what i do is support the

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,149
weakest links in the chain the

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,540
distributions that are vulnerable that

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:36,839
can be preyed upon it's the it's a it's

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,870
a very old model but the antelope that

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,149
that wander off and and stray are the

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,939
ones that get pounced on and and and

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,699
made into a meal and that's essentially

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:49,680
what goes on in industry is if you stray

00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:53,160
from the pack and you're not part of it

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,439
can be part of this community you can be

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,970
turned there I have many many stories of

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:01,379
companies being approached and told you

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,809
know you're going to use this

00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,220
distribution versus this distribution if

00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:06,929
you maintain Linux or you're not going

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,999
to maintain the order or we're going to

00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:10,980
sue you and we'll use our portfolio to

00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:15,389
basically drive you out of business a

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:18,779
lot of the behavioral quirks that's used

00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:20,490
to see from Cisco and in the in the mid

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,250
to late 90s before they kind of

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:26,620
understood

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:28,720
how how the intellectual property space

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,330
worked and they became a believer that

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,370
they had to have IP those are the same

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,290
kind of behaviors you saw from from

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,300
companies like Microsoft oh and you

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,590
continue to see to this day and in some

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,230
ways you almost have to be empathetic

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,420
not sympathetic but empathetic because

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,300
it's very difficult just extremely

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:54,370
difficult to create an industry and to

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,400
watch it evolve and not have the ability

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,130
this the internal sense making skills to

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:04,150
be able to navigate with it so that you

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,750
can maintain a position of primacy but

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,580
the discontinuity that that open source

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:13,780
represents is one that has challenged

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:16,930
these traditional organizations to to

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,670
really adopt the strategy when David

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,530
Einhorn who's one of the lead investors

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:25,870
in Microsoft two three weeks ago made a

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,930
comment calling for Steve Ballmer's head

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:32,320
we had exchanged emails and and the

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,030
basic three line email is if you don't

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,520
have an open source strategy you're not

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,470
going to be relevant long-term that's

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,990
just the way it is and he understands

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:45,280
that he's an extremely bright height

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,839
which intolerant individual who runs a

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,020
hedge fund and they're the large he's

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:53,380
the third largest private investor in in

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,630
Microsoft behind Ballmer and gates in

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,880
terms of the shareholding and sees he's

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:01,210
constantly pushing them on issues like

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,480
this to develop a strategy it's only one

00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,490
of the challenges he has but but it's or

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
one of the concerns he has but it is one

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,760
of those concerns that even that smart

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,800
people recognize that if you're going to

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,870
run a company in this day and age you

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,610
have to understand how you interact in

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,010
the open source community how you

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,990
participate how you create value how you

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,940
partner these are things that are very

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,520
difficult for companies that are

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,270
essentially natural or artificial

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,370
monopolists and so while we can be

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,339
empathetic at the same time we need to

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,390
make sure that those behaviors don't

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,850
don't become ones that

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,500
Rob the community of choice again the

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,240
vendor has to have choice in what

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,180
they're going to be choose to put out in

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,530
the marketplace the carrier if it's a

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,210
we're talking about telecommunications

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,670
networks have to have choice and their

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,800
customers need choice and our whole goal

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,970
is to ensure that that choice exists and

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,760
so one thing that we've started to do is

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,060
as in addition to buying patents and

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,590
then making them available royalty-free

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:07,780
we've started a number of programs

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:10,600
designed to attempt to protect the

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:16,090
community and to leverage the community

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:18,520
one thing about about the EE world

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,320
versus the computer science world where

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,760
most coders come from the latter

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,650
community is that the sanctity of the

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,660
engineering notebook in a ee world

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:32,160
you're really socialized with that

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,450
during undergraduate and graduate school

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,520
whereas in computer science if it

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,860
doesn't appear in code it doesn't exist

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,430
and unfortunately code is not searchable

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:45,430
as a form of prior art while people

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,590
might like to think that Google is is

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,060
capable of everything they are capable

00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,550
of a lot and there are some very

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,870
creative people at Google unfortunately

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:59,020
right now at the present day code is not

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,890
searchable and as a result it there is

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,630
no record of invention and there has

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,199
been no record of intervention for 20

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:11,740
years now unfortunately when when

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:14,170
Richard Stallman was proselytizing as

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:19,959
far back as the mid to late 60s about

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:21,910
the value of open source and i don't i

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,430
don't find fault with Richards view on

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,709
this but his execs planation to me is

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,200
when you're assuring in a movement you

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,730
need simple messages and you need you

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,030
don't want to complicate things by

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:37,510
having qualified kind of views on issues

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,980
like oak like like patenting he doesn't

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,010
believe obviously that patent should

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:46,710
exist in in the in the software space

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,920
but at the same time there was another

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,630
qualification

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,810
been introduced but because of the need

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,060
to drive a total transformation and

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,160
thinking of how people invent and how

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,010
they create value in an account in an

00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,500
economy I think Richard took took the

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,330
path of throwing them throwing the baby

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,100
out with the bathwater a little bit by

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,460
encouraging a whole generation of people

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,900
not to think about patenting and not

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,510
patenting is not something I have a

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,490
problem with the problem I have is that

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,440
we haven't created a record of

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,570
inventiveness that record of

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,690
inventiveness would have would have

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:24,760
precluded probably thousands of patents

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,070
of being being issued in the United

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,420
States alone and there are software

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,740
patents that have been issued even

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,840
though the Europeans say that they're

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,910
not supporting software patents there

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,830
are still thousands of software patents

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:40,960
across the European jurisdictions in

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:44,110
patent and trademark world and so it was

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,900
a it was a calculated move that had a

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,200
very positive effect in terms of clear

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,670
concise message open source changing the

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,880
way of life changing a way of creating

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,490
value in an economy simple but complex

00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,100
took a long time to ultimately get there

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,380
and then you know Lena's came along as

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,890
kind of a golden child with the the most

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,630
significant of all the several thousand

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,430
technology open source programs to me

00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,890
it's the tip of the spear so by

00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,050
supporting Linux so goes Linux so goes

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,020
open source as a modality for invention

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,000
which is what I really view it as and so

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:25,090
that's why whatever we do in Linux I

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,030
view as having a a correlative effect on

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,790
what happens in the in the overall world

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:35,070
of open sources again this modality of

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:38,470
development and of creating value and so

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:43,090
we have created a variety of mechanisms

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:45,100
of attempting to reengage the community

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,380
around the importance of contribution

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,820
not the importance of patenting but the

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,880
importance of contribution and

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,340
codification of inventiveness so that

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,770
it's not buried and lost in code but it

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,870
can be rer tick you lated and made

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,600
accessible and made useful so that we

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:05,250
can stem the

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:10,500
the flow of new patents in software that

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:12,630
are merely taking ideas and

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,700
inventiveness that have have been codify

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,620
out that that Aaron code but have never

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,490
been made accessible so that they can't

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,830
serve as a as a bar so the Linux

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,870
community is essentially a massive

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:29,160
resource it's tens of millions of people

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:31,260
that are ultimately have access to be

00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,870
able to contribute and they've got all

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,780
this passion all this knowledge and and

00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,520
there's an integrity there's a there's

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,880
an authenticity about the community

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:45,720
which you can't bottle it's just it's

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,700
just incredibly powerful early in my

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,520
career when I was a diplomat it was

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,490
really my own personal motivation then

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,080
was making the world safe for democracy

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,460
now I've kind of come full circle and

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm making the world safe for the

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,400
democratization of innovation which is

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:05,250
far more powerful than anything I've

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,250
ever done and so it excites me every day

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:11,030
to play a part in enabling smart people

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,590
to create value and in this unique way

00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:16,770
but what I'm also trying to do in

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:20,160
addition to the creativity in encode and

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,350
product and development and and and

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,110
technology that ultimately results from

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,090
these contribution to also leverage the

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,670
same characteristics to actually allow

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:34,020
for patent issues to be dealt with more

00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:36,600
effectively I described a little bit of

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,100
this but what oin does is you've got

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,500
these industrial companies that have

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,120
come together with no personal gain and

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,220
one of the first things I did when I was

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,410
recruited to take over this role three

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,970
and a half years ago was was asked the

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,490
question of every one of the companies

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,110
is there another shoe that's going to

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,660
drop am I going to be asked to do

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,570
something for any of these companies and

00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,880
it you know true to their word I've not

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,590
been asked to do one thing for one

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,260
individual thing for any one of these

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:07,850
companies that support this and that's

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,350
why it's it's a highly unusual and and

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:16,150
potentially very powerful

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:17,740
a counterbalance to to the the behaviors

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,200
of large companies that support

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:23,230
proprietary platforms that are not not

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,200
on board with with a strategy to be able

00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,960
to participate in in Linux or an open

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,840
source and so what we're trying to do is

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,640
really create a patent no-fly zone we're

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,590
not a hundred percent effective about

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,799
but you know some of the things that you

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,890
was just a session that I was in on

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:44,799
listening to from a PhD student at the

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,980
University of Georgia on on the whole

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,780
social component of the value of the net

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,940
and the value of contribution and

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,700
collaboration which i think is very

00:22:51,940 --> 00:23:00,760
important and in that session there was

00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:04,059
a there were some comments on on how one

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,730
has this this goal of kind of creating a

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:08,679
an environment where we're in where

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,770
we're we're we're continuing to

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,470
contribute and free and open and

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,270
allowing for access for all people I

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,919
think that's very important and I think

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,179
you know lifeline services there a

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,200
number of other ways where we're

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:25,419
extending out service for for internet

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,520
access that's parallels what we used to

00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:30,309
consider voice access was the only thing

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,150
that warranted lifeline services but now

00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:36,400
we're expanding it out and so what we're

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,370
essentially doing is is acquiring

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,100
patents that are relevant to companies

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,640
that again that are antagonist ictal

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,080
enix we have patents that they need if

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,240
they want to continue to operate their

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,350
business we only acquire patents that

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:56,919
are that are by virtue of their value or

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:59,500
their power against other companies are

00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:02,080
incredibly useful in enabling Linux and

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,770
enabling freedom of action in Linux so

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,380
we acquire patents we have over 300 plus

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:11,190
patents now we would we do directed

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,650
invention work we work with universities

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,870
with individual inventors we acquire

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,809
small medium-sized enterprises where

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,149
necessary that have their patent rich we

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:24,119
retain the

00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:27,690
the lead inventors in those companies we

00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:30,809
bought a virtualization company a year

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,210
and a half ago that where we still have

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:36,779
the CTO on board and he's inventing for

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:40,289
us and we develop shadow roadmaps for

00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:44,879
where Linux is going and are looking to

00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:48,409
constantly be ahead of Linux so that

00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:51,169
that we're creating this this path of

00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:53,999
freedom of action and freedom to operate

00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,789
we also creating defense of publications

00:24:53,999 --> 00:25:00,629
they'll talk a little bit about those

00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:03,210
and what's happening in in a non Linux

00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:04,979
society and that in just core technology

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,940
companies is actually quite beneficial

00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:10,769
to us you have a lot of invention that

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,859
people are moving away from raw numbers

00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:17,279
which is a good thing so there's

00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:19,109
generally a focus now on let's file only

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,599
on things that are more fundamental

00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:23,669
inventions and let's let's not build

00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,690
patent families the traditional way of

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:30,059
filing of developing patents is that

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:33,299
because you can only reward equality is

00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,729
a very difficult master to to reward so

00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,769
because you can't reward quality most

00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:39,899
most large companies and their

00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:42,029
intellectual property departments reward

00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:44,039
people based on how many patents they

00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:46,619
file and how many get granted in a given

00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:49,109
year which creates some of the natural

00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:52,469
distortions that we have in the world as

00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:54,149
we see it now with record numbers of

00:25:52,469 --> 00:26:01,049
patents being issued over the last 20

00:25:54,149 --> 00:26:03,719
years and so because of that distortion

00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:06,269
you now have a situation where you've

00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:08,580
got lots of patents out there not a good

00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,409
way of controlling what's created inside

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,809
organizations because you can't really

00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:14,969
measure quality and you get a shoot but

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,759
you have a reaction now which is a shift

00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:21,059
most areas are such the technology

00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,450
inventiveness is is happening at such a

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,369
pace that you can't develop a

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,559
fundamental patent or two and then all

00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:30,570
these siblings sister child patents

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,969
around it to protect it because you have

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,220
core invention and you have claimed

00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:35,840
scope and

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,400
the first couple of inventions in a

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,890
technology area you have the broadest

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,750
claims and then you start to think about

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,780
other ways that you could use this and

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,539
you start to invent out from there what

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,659
companies are doing now like IBM and

00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:53,809
Phillips and and Motorola and Siemens

00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:55,690
and Ericsson and scores of other

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,770
companies what they're doing is creating

00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,080
defensive publications which are

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,460
statements of invention wrapping their

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,380
core inventions with those

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,470
contemporaneous with the filing of the

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,390
core invention as a patent and so the

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,640
defensive publications protect their

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,940
patents in the way that the child our

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,010
sibling sibling patents would but it

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,470
allows you to develop your portfolio

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,020
very quickly and your defensive

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,780
positioning very quickly we provide our

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,309
patents royalty-free so that anyone who

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,380
wants a license can have a license

00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:29,390
there's no charge for the patents the

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,940
only thing you have to agree is good

00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:34,010
hygiene reciprocity within the community

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,840
that if you're going to take our patents

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,230
and have a license to those for free

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,419
then its royalty free there's no fees of

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,250
any kind no dollars to change hands you

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,580
just have to agree its terms of

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,230
consideration and consideration is very

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,970
important than this from a legal

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,919
standpoint because the conveyance does

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,380
not fails for lack of consideration

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,200
because it's a contract and in any

00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:00,740
contract you have to have consideration

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,679
and so what we do is require that

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,510
companies that take a license be in a

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,970
position where they will provide access

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:11,030
to everyone else in the community that

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,250
takes a license their patents that read

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,530
on the Linux definition and we're in the

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,679
process of redefining what linux is

00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:22,220
based on a pretty thorough analysis of

00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:26,059
of all of the new linux based platforms

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:30,350
like android and webos and and and

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:32,330
others and and so the other obligation

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:35,059
is that you agree not to sue based on

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:38,450
linux grounds now Oracle's suit against

00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:40,909
against Google in the way that we look

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,580
at the Linux definition when you take

00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:46,429
technology this is an interpretation

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,500
it's not necessarily a statement of fact

00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,330
but it's an interpret

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,430
tation when you take proprietary

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,000
technology and you embed it or thread it

00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:58,360
into an open source platform you haven't

00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,880
been able to absolvo yourself of

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,760
liability or responsibility to deal with

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,410
the with the misappropriation that

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,950
technology if you don't have a license

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:14,430
and so that may be the way that case

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:18,850
comes out may not it it just depends but

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:21,220
what you hear a lot in you know this the

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,350
whole process now I think grok law is

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,090
now transitioning and those of you who

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,460
haven't seen grok lots it's a good thing

00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,930
to look at when you because it's a it's

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,320
a statement of what's happening in

00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:36,670
patent issues related to open source

00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:39,640
mark webbing who was at red hat from the

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,880
beginning is now going to be managing

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:47,080
wroclaw pj pam jones who's done a

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,710
remarkable job with that has stepping

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,530
down from day-to-day responsibilities

00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:55,390
but there are a number of sources of

00:29:53,530 --> 00:30:00,510
information out there that's just one of

00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:02,800
them but it's an important one what

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,860
companies like Microsoft have done is

00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,190
started to engage people to counteract

00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:12,250
the editorial pieces that come out in

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,020
places like wroclaw or open source com

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:20,230
or other other places where you're

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:22,540
seeing more thoughtful contribution and

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:28,570
interpretation to help people understand

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:31,390
what's happening and so you see Florian

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,400
Mueller who if you want to look at blogs

00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,660
I don't spend a lot of time looking at

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,840
blogs but I get them sent to me

00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,040
periodically and i'll look at headlines

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,740
there are a lot of slides on there that

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:46,030
better curry were created in redmond

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:49,330
that are we'll talk about you know the

00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:53,020
various litigations of for instance the

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:56,560
number of little oo soo t'set are

00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,540
currently in play related to android for

00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,760
example because the whole notion is too

00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,550
slow Android by saying

00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,550
you know you shouldn't take Android as a

00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:08,170
carrier or as a the users don't really

00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,430
care but as a carrier you don't want to

00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,800
take Android because it's fraught with

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,230
problems or as a vendor you don't want

00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,350
to standardize on Android because you

00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,210
should standardize on on Windows 7 for

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,060
mobile or Windows 8 for mobile when it

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:25,720
comes out and so you want to avoid

00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:28,120
litigation we're clean their dirty and

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,260
so it's it's a pretty basic strategy of

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:35,200
misinformation based on a very kernel of

00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:39,790
a small kernel of fact that's ultimately

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,910
been been blown out to to the point

00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,130
where it's almost unrecognizable but

00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:48,880
this is a this is again it's it's part

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:51,460
of the of the lovely I wouldn't call it

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,410
a war but it's definitely there a series

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,560
of skirmishes that go on an almost daily

00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,210
basis many times during the week I'll

00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,000
get calls from companies who are being

00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,950
asserted against and on Linux grounds

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,510
and and I'll talk a little bit about

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,430
some of those situations as we go

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,500
forward but their variety of things that

00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,240
we do that's really kind of what i call

00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,590
one-on-one navigational guidance when

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,830
people call us and they want to know

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:17,350
what should we do how should we act who

00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:22,350
should we hire software freedom law

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:25,450
center provides provides legal support

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:28,750
linux foundation has a legal component

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:30,640
to it we have dozens of lawyers that we

00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,700
access at some of the largest firms in

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,370
the world the one thing that's important

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,000
is that we don't do this in any in any

00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,440
kind of this is too important Linux is

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,210
too important that open source is too

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,310
important for us to do this on the cheap

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,270
we will spend whatever money is

00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:52,570
necessary to make sure that Linux wins

00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:55,000
unequivocal this is not a science fair

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,280
project this is not something that I

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,620
don't do this because I you know I kind

00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,480
of don't have anything else to do I do

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,120
this because I'm committed to the

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,080
mission of making them making this

00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,790
opportunity space available and ensuring

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,570
that it doesn't go away because it's

00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:14,580
just too rich a vein fork in the in the

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,559
history of human

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,750
I'm and how we create value in an

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,350
economy this is just too significant and

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,230
so we will not we we're not looking for

00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,700
headlines we get them sometimes but what

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,740
we're really looking for us for the

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,510
people who are the creative people at

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,519
conferences like this and all around the

00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,289
world for those people to be the ones

00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,760
that they get the credit the attention

00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:40,620
and and and our our understanding of

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,909
where the value really sits that

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,299
everyone understands where the value

00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:48,419
sits it's the kids and you know that are

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,789
participating in in the in the google

00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,830
Summer of Code you know that's that

00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:54,529
those are the exciting places to you

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,029
know go to an annual you know the

00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:59,490
meetings where you know those kids are

00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:02,309
being brought in it's an incredible rush

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,720
to be to kind of see kids starting the

00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:10,169
process and then as they come through

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,450
and and and and get nurtured we're where

00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:15,210
we are doing defensive patent sales now

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,250
you won't see a lot of mention of this I

00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,010
tend not to go out of my way to mention

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:22,440
this but in this environment I will and

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,119
since it was brought up Microsoft that

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,070
leaked some information about this we

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,470
just i decided i clarify it with you

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:32,159
today and then linux defenders which

00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:34,080
i'll talk about as well over 300 patents

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,300
and applications they're designed to

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,490
neutralize threat they enable linux

00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,929
development many of these are right in

00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:44,669
the critical path of where linux is

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:46,619
going we've to try to move things

00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:50,490
forward we have 150 defensive

00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:53,220
publications that we've funded or

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:56,030
contributed the development of we'd like

00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,320
to have 10,000 defensive publications

00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,650
because they're this is essentially the

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,570
statement that is the the more of these

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,750
we get out there the fewer patents get

00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:08,580
issued it's very simple calculus and for

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,500
me broadening this message to the

00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,900
community if I could do one thing to the

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,020
to the development community it would be

00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,570
to have people at least invent one thing

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,460
that's in the form of an acceptable

00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,410
prior art which is a defensive

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,440
publication it can never be used against

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,000
anyone to restrict their activities it

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,970
doesn't give you a negative right the

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
way a patent does

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,270
all it does give you any right it just

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,310
states what what's been invented and

00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,460
it's accessible and searchable by every

00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:39,220
patent examiner in the world community

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:42,250
participation obviously is key here this

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:45,670
is the the three elements appear to pat

00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,859
of Linux defenders one is providing a

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,990
portal into an existing program called

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:52,570
peer to patent which is when there's a

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,730
published application you have a period

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,160
of time to be able to submit the

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,660
equivalent of what would be information

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,790
that would be in opposition to the

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,950
granting of that patent so before it

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,980
becomes a patent once it's published and

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,680
just visible to the public we want the

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,960
community to to basically come in and

00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,570
identify a bunch of prior art so that

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,940
that application can be rejected or its

00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:18,760
claims can be dramatically reduced and

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,130
then the other program we have is post

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,660
issue pr2 patent so after a patent has

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,890
been issued its if it should have never

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,910
been issued because there's a lot of

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:33,070
creativity that's out there that's in

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:35,710
that appears in in encode or is well

00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:37,450
known we're inviting people by putting

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,490
patents up on post issue period of

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,830
patent to contribute prior arts so that

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:46,060
lawyers can negotiate better agreements

00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:47,530
with settlements that are not going to

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,740
be not going to have the kind of

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:53,020
potentially debilitating effect that a

00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,109
that a license might have for a higher

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,849
royalty rate and make linux on economic

00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:00,820
or make an open source project on

00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:03,730
economic so we're looking here to do

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,849
request for re exams in certain cases we

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:09,310
did one last year with sflc as the

00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,859
filing entity but we coordinated behind

00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,450
the scenes to make sure it got done we

00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:16,480
worked with a company and we worked with

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,670
sflc to ensure that the request for

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:24,010
re-exam could be done and that will come

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:25,720
up soon for for evaluation and we're

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,450
just looking to raise a lot of prior

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,180
arts so that that cases can either go

00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,730
away or they can the effect of those

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,349
cases can be minimized or potentially

00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,760
will identify patents in people's

00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:38,650
portfolios that we don't think should

00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,450
have ever been issued and we'll look to

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,010
have their the claims of those patents

00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:45,109
only weakened by identifying a whole

00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:50,540
bunch of prior art and then defensive

00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:52,490
publications as i mentioned and linux

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,430
defenders org is is where all this

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:58,310
information is ways in which we

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:03,050
participate let's see where are we I

00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:05,349
guess we're okay in time i'll talk a

00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:07,820
little bit about this is just kind of a

00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,200
stream of consciousness of a few things

00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,089
that we've done that i threw up that i

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,770
thought might be interesting software

00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:16,190
tree was a patent being asserted by a

00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:19,130
troll we identified enough art so that

00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,780
the settlement was I think one

00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,980
one-hundredth of what they were

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,630
originally asking for and so it was in

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,099
the like a hundred thousand dollars or

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,290
something like that and what they wanted

00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,440
was to get you know millions of dollars

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:37,550
from lots of players in the marketplace

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:41,599
and so we contributed art through

00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:43,730
through crowdsourcing by we do a whole

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,339
bunch of prior art searching ourselves

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,349
we have experts that are scientific

00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:51,920
experts and engineers and computer

00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:55,819
scientists and industry experts and then

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,400
also just search experts and then we

00:38:55,819 --> 00:39:01,700
hire groups as well to do prior art

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,470
searching and then we put the two kind

00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,079
of prime the pump we put some of that up

00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,430
on Linux defenders and then invite the

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,829
community grok law would do

00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,680
announcements periodically saying please

00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:15,020
contribute prior art so that we can we

00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,420
can limit the effect of this patent the

00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:21,079
fat patent which is the base of a lot of

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:23,480
assertions by Microsoft which is

00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,339
essentially a de facto standard for in

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,140
Turkey any time anyone's interconnect in

00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:28,790
between heterogeneous networks where one

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,990
of those networks is a windows network

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:34,970
or exchange network that is essentially

00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:38,690
the dispositive patent it's not a very

00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:44,960
good patent the request for reexamine

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:46,490
was done and probably this is a lot of

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,220
complicated elements about how you do

00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,140
reexamine a patent and validated it's

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,700
not the easiest thing and sometimes it's

00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,960
not your fault it just doesn't come out

00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,099
well that was one of those situations

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,160
where

00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:59,950
five years ago when it was done or yeah

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,849
there's about four and a half years ago

00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:08,239
it that the result was not good it ended

00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:10,249
up it ended up reinforcing the validity

00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,910
of the patent which was the opposite

00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:16,309
intent Verne etics is an active troll

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:18,289
has one of the large it's a very

00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:20,630
significant patent portfolio their

00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:24,410
settlement against Microsoft was a

00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,819
couple hundred million dollars and they

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,489
have the potential to get settlements

00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:30,319
like that against lots of other people

00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:32,539
so we're looking to week in that

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,119
portfolio so that it doesn't affect the

00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:37,759
Linux community PHP patents and

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:42,920
biometric patents we bought recently two

00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:46,160
very large portfolios significant dollar

00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,829
portfolios the PHP patents the everybody

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,680
in this room views a PHP page every day

00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:55,670
or they write one or they they host one

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,609
if they have a company and PHP is

00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,969
ubiquitous and so we have the

00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:03,769
fundamental patent that covers PHP we

00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:05,630
didn't buy it because it's a stopper

00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:07,130
against Microsoft or anyone else we

00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,670
bought it's purely to enable the

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:13,849
community because anyone who creates a

00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:17,450
PHP page needs this and this is the

00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:20,989
value of this patent is probably well

00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:24,440
over 250 million dollars because in the

00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:26,299
wrong hands it would would in being be

00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,880
involved in Syria litigation against

00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:31,759
hundreds of companies mostly large

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,180
companies that's that social networking

00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:36,979
companies and and companies that that do

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,499
a lot of transactions would be the first

00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:41,539
target online and then people who just

00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,759
display content everybody is vulnerable

00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:45,890
to this Pat these patents we bought them

00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:47,450
we make them available freely to anyone

00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,400
who wants a license and we encourage

00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,469
anyone from the smallest company to the

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,180
largest company to take a license we

00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:58,819
have 371 licensees right now and they

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:01,549
include the original six companies in

00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:08,990
oin they also include oracle and ben

00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:10,490
google and and canonical and HP and

00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:13,490
sooo and a whole range of large

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:17,450
companies as well as as Facebook and

00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:20,980
Twitter salesforce.com this is a

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:23,860
situation that we were involved in

00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:28,880
salesforce com was being approached by

00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:31,460
Microsoft and asserted against on 14

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:36,369
patents six of the patents were focused

00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:40,820
on on Linux alleged to be Linux related

00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:42,619
patents and Salesforce had precious few

00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,900
patents in their portfolio they're the

00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:48,340
classic antelope target that I mentioned

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:53,540
earlier and they're also very squeaky

00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:55,460
Marc Benioff is essentially a and the

00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,950
apple doesn't fall far from the tree

00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,740
Marc Benioff worked for a Larry Ellison

00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:04,010
for quite some time and has stylistic

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:08,690
approach that is equally combative and

00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:13,280
so by continuing to assault at least

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:15,619
verbally Microsoft for so long finally

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,869
they said all right we'll sue these guys

00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:19,940
and put them in their place not

00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:22,570
realizing that the fatal error they were

00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:26,590
making was actually raising the Linux

00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:30,200
element we provided we spent six months

00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:31,700
mapping and matching patents and making

00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,590
sure that their client there their

00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,420
counsel was comfortable validity

00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:37,460
assertions go on for a long time before

00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,020
they get to litigation litigation was

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,170
coming and they were being told it was

00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,420
coming so we essentially they're all

00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,950
there's a lot of nuance to this but you

00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,390
have to have if you want to be able to

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,369
get an injunction which against a large

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,050
cash bear and cash machine like

00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:53,330
Microsoft or Apple or something like

00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,790
that you need to have patents that read

00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,609
on what they do but also read on what

00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:01,190
you do this is an ebay ruling that came

00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:03,080
out a few years ago that requires this

00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,640
if you want to get an injunction and you

00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,859
don't want to be in that if you're going

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,900
to use patents you want to actually you

00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:12,320
know have be a wasp and leave it leave a

00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,270
mark and so the only way to do that is

00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,840
to get an injunction that gets people's

00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:19,070
attention settlement 50 million 100

00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,530
million dollars two hundred million

00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,460
dollars is meaningless to to companies

00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,760
like Apple and

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,010
and Microsoft at this juncture and so

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,660
you have to be able to enjoin products

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,990
that are high value products that

00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,640
generate profitability they have a lot

00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,109
of businesses it's very easy when you're

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,330
as large as they are to generate

00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:41,270
top-line it's very hard to generate

00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:43,880
profitability because still the

00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,680
franchise is where they generate most of

00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,990
their most of their revenue and profit

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,270
so you need patents that read on the

00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:53,869
franchise so we sold four patents to

00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:56,920
sales for Salesforce immediately advised

00:44:53,869 --> 00:45:01,580
through Marc Benioff immediately advised

00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,839
the people at in at Redmond that they

00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,150
now had our patents and they were

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,180
prepared to get more so they better back

00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,890
off I got a call from Microsoft

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,690
immediately after that saying hey what

00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:14,030
are you guys doing I said we're going to

00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:15,920
do this every time you raise you raise

00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,750
Linux in litigation we have no problem

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,180
with you asserting your port portfolio

00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,950
that's non Linux related but we think a

00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,930
lot of your Linux related stuff is not

00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:26,510
really Linux related but you're creating

00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,520
a Spectre you're building it's what I

00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:30,650
call their totem strategy they have

00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,880
large totems they want to build and put

00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:34,190
out in front of their redmond

00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,900
headquarters with with the logos of

00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:39,140
large companies that have allegedly

00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:41,240
taken Linux licenses in point of fact

00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,220
most companies that take Linux licenses

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,839
their throw ins and there they just

00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,940
throw them in they never even look at

00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,180
the what are alleged to be Linux related

00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,070
patents so it's a it's a rather need an

00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,020
elegant strategy that they have to try

00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,460
to create a perception that this they're

00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:58,369
the center of the Linux space from a

00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:03,730
patent standpoint which they're not and

00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:06,589
so they were sued three days later and

00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,119
miraculously all of the the Linux

00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,589
related patents were pulled from the

00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,710
little bit from the assertion and they

00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:15,160
weren't part of the litigation and the

00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:17,900
settlement occurred two weeks later so

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,599
it was a situation that would have never

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,750
settled in that time frame because they

00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:26,030
were the classic vulnerable company

00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,619
tomtom the next one I'll talk about Tom

00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,839
Tom had some of its own patents that

00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:32,150
read on Microsoft they didn't need our

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,339
patents but they did need the connection

00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,750
and relationship for potential the

00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:37,690
specter of us be

00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:46,010
able to provide more patents to them

00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:49,550
tomtom was before really before the

00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:52,610
Android platform which has kind of made

00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:55,250
TomTom less relevant tomtom was the kind

00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:58,370
of the kleenex of europe for and still

00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:01,190
is very popular for the the navigation

00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:04,730
space and so they had just over

00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:07,250
leveraged themselves by buying a one of

00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:11,930
the two most significant mapping

00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:13,160
companies in the world and it was common

00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,480
knowledge because they're a public

00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,870
company that they had to reschedule

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,090
their debt and three weeks later they

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,050
were sued by Microsoft after it was

00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,510
announced that they had to reschedule

00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,830
their debt so rescheduling the debt

00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,480
means they're vulnerable they couldn't

00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,250
service their debt it's at the certain

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,900
levels because the market was they were

00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,640
in the middle of the were in the middle

00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,490
of financial crisis and the market was

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,500
dipping and so because there's less

00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,240
discretionary income being used on these

00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:42,500
kinds of products during that period two

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:46,700
years ago and so Microsoft attacked them

00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,740
with the fat patent and didn't seem to

00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,960
have any intention of settling we

00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,730
announced a license they've been no

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,830
movement from the original request which

00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:57,410
was for very significant dollar figure

00:47:54,830 --> 00:48:02,150
we announced a license and four days

00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:04,760
later Microsoft settled and settled for

00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,680
a very small percentage of what was it's

00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,870
something that's when your public

00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,440
company you have a requirement to reveal

00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:14,330
material settlements in litigation

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,610
because the taxpayer or that the

00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:23,050
investors have a right to know it wasn't

00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:26,120
material by standards of the of the the

00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,290
Amsterdam exchange so I think that tells

00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,300
you that it was a rather insignificant

00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:32,030
settlement that Microsoft got in that

00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,370
situation microsoft also two year or a

00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:37,160
year and a half ago two years ago was

00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:40,700
attempting to package up patents with a

00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,610
bunch of claim charts showing reads on a

00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:47,140
variety of open-source products in linux

00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:48,820
in particular we worked with another

00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,220
patent management

00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,680
organization called Allied security

00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,210
trust to have them by the patents on our

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,330
behalf and then they flowed through to

00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:00,670
us because Microsoft was did purposely

00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:02,170
did not show them to us because they

00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,640
wanted to sell them to a light security

00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,980
trust because everything that allied

00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,710
security trust gets they have to sell on

00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,990
to trolls so is essentially a money

00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,790
laundering patent laundering scheme not

00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,010
money laundry but it's the same concept

00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:18,610
you launder the patents you remove this

00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:21,670
distinct of your own your own behaviors

00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:24,340
and it actually is a relative good guy

00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,470
defensive patent purchaser that doesn't

00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,650
have a mandate our mandate is to support

00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,510
the entire community in a way of life

00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,220
AST & RPX or patent management

00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,140
organizations that support clubs of

00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,030
companies they have no obligation to

00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,220
anyone else except those club members

00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,500
which is very different from what we do

00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,750
and so anyway this is just an example of

00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,010
how we participate there's a variety of

00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:51,790
other things that we do on a regular

00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:54,010
basis but for us it's this this whole

00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,980
notion of discontinuity and the idea of

00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:58,930
increasing returns or network effects is

00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,160
really what we're trying to get to to

00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,650
trick to make sure there are no

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:06,310
subluxation zor or bottlenecks that

00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:10,330
discourage the free flow of ideas and

00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:11,830
the and the creation modality that we

00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,630
have around these platforms that I've

00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,290
talking about because new novelty

00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,490
creates much more value in an economy

00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:20,290
discontinuous innovations this is what

00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,750
we're things that radically dafont

00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,940
redefine existing markets or create new

00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,890
ones this is what we're looking to see

00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,290
more of in the in the open source

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,240
community and we have great hope there's

00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:33,550
great hope that that can occur I mean

00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:37,510
just look at the from the original

00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:41,080
introduction of of one of of apples most

00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:44,620
elegant failures much like the Lisa the

00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:50,320
the Newton that was introduced in in 94

00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:52,810
late 94 was a great product to show us

00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,520
where we could go a horrible product in

00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:56,470
terms of sales and everybody thought

00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,960
John Sculley was an idiot but John

00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,550
Sculley was not an idiot John Sculley

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,030
knew that you have to have directional

00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:05,859
products to be able to help

00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:07,599
provides some some understanding to a

00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:10,270
community to kind of rethink how you

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,940
interface and use technology that was

00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:14,980
the beginning of the PDA the first

00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,250
effective PDA of the type that we

00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:22,420
currently use and call smartphones now

00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:24,609
and from that on donna Dubinsky steam

00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,970
really over the next ten years refined

00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:29,589
and developed less complex version that

00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,150
was that was consistent with where

00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:34,329
networks were at that particular point

00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:36,790
in terms of capability and content and

00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:40,660
allowed for the migration to the point

00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:43,359
we're at now so it really if we look

00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:45,700
back to the origins it was a wonderfully

00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:48,099
elegant failure but it's something that

00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:51,579
created a different way for us to

00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:58,570
interact with information well beyond

00:51:51,579 --> 00:52:00,820
the hegemony of the pc and linux

00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:03,160
defenders as i said earlier we've got

00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,079
this other activity going on where the

00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,910
community is using defensive

00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,650
publications i think we can live in the

00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:11,680
slipstream of that because patent

00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:13,060
managed patent examiners at the PTO in

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,800
the US and everywhere around the world

00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,660
they're looking for these defensive

00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,790
publications these statements of prior

00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,890
art because they are there they are

00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:23,680
interested in issuing fewer patents

00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,150
especially in the u.s. they'd like to

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,579
but they're having difficulty getting

00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:31,420
there and so they need help from the

00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:34,150
community whatever happens on in terms

00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:37,000
of whatever Congress produces as a

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:38,920
reform act for intellectual property we

00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,990
can't count on that addressing the needs

00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,020
of this community in particular or of

00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:45,940
any community really because it's always

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,579
filled with compromise and you have to

00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,130
meet legislation and legend regulatory

00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:55,210
reform halfway the same is true for

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:57,010
judicial reform it can't be counted on

00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:59,890
to do all the work the community has to

00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:02,170
meet it halfway and so my view is absent

00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,550
participation from the community we're

00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,319
not going to get the prior art out there

00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,980
we're going to have continuing issues

00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:10,599
with patents what I want to do is

00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,160
develop ways through linux defenders of

00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:14,619
dealing with the past the present and

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,940
the future of patenting so that patents

00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:17,620
represent less of a thought

00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,980
on our side we've got billions of

00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,990
dollars that's seeping into the patent

00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,480
speculation world where patent trolls

00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:28,350
are now acquiring patents purely for the

00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,980
purpose of not adding any value except

00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:34,150
participating in the arbitrage

00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,650
opportunities of litigation it costs you

00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:38,290
three and a half to five million dollars

00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:40,000
to defend a lawsuit in the US and it

00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:43,060
cost you eight to 12 million dollars to

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,030
defendant ITC action that combined

00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:49,000
amount which is what what tom tom was

00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:52,450
facing by the way he's crippling it

00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,490
forces you to alter your decisions about

00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:56,650
what choices and technology are going to

00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:59,290
make it see it's a question of survival

00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:01,390
or linux you're going to choose survival

00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,400
because you're your ultimate obligation

00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:07,330
is to your shareholders even if you have

00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:11,680
to limp along and so I mean look at

00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:14,980
nokia yahoo i mean there are very

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,110
difficult decisions to be made and it's

00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:20,050
hard to completely fault companies for

00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:22,210
making what I think time will tell will

00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:24,160
show us was the wrong decision but at

00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:26,350
the time in the innovative in the

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,030
individual moment it's very hard to say

00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:30,010
that those those were the incorrect

00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:33,310
decisions because everything is so

00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,960
contextual I just know that nokian Yahoo

00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:38,860
will be very different companies five

00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,900
years from now and so we're looking to

00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,550
try and get more people to continue to

00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,190
participate in this crowd sourcing

00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:47,650
initiative identify more art and help us

00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:49,990
create more art so that fewer patents

00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,000
get issued in the future help us with

00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:54,880
this this notion of creating the

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,490
antidote for the patent excess we've had

00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,550
over the last 20 years which is the the

00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:02,350
idea of creating value and codifying it

00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,780
so that fewer things ultimately get

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:11,400
issued does anybody have any questions I

00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:11,400
think we have a couple of minutes yes

00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:24,770
it's all those six companies IBM Red Hat

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:27,420
novell Sony neck and Philips they get

00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:31,530
they signed the exact same license that

00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,540
someone who pays zero dollars gets this

00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,580
is a very weird from a business

00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,280
standpoint that's why i said it's

00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:40,550
unheard of there's no precedent for oin

00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:44,790
it's the whitest of white hat

00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:46,950
organizations designed to essentially

00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:57,660
make sure that this transition to an

00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:59,910
open source world is effective yes yet

00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:03,260
Google is we have a very very close

00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:06,750
relationship with Google and Google is

00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:10,410
we support the the Android platform not

00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:12,360
to the expense of webos or amigo if me

00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:15,210
whoever gets off the ground or lemo for

00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,860
that matter but Google's Google's you

00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:19,920
know there are two things going on one

00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,750
is Google's success and its

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,840
diversification of business strategy

00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:26,850
means that it it is becoming it's going

00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,520
through a process that's similar to what

00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:31,650
Cisco went through in the in the late

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,170
90s when mike volpe was buying a company

00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:36,030
every six and a half weeks a lot of

00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:39,990
those companies were the vehicle for

00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:41,670
Cisco to build up an IP portfolio in

00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:43,860
this case they're not pursuing an

00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,140
acquisition strategy of of small

00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,730
medium-sized entities they're they're

00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,550
pursuing an acquisition of large

00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:54,150
portfolios to be able to give them a

00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:56,400
position of relative strength because

00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,680
they need they need balance this is my

00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,670
perception from the outside in and then

00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,100
in the open source world they're there

00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:09,630
what they've done with with Android is I

00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:12,510
think phenomenal in terms of pursuing

00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:15,480
and advancing a strategy designed to

00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:18,930
encourage uptake of an open source

00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,520
platform so they're very very much

00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,370
involved and I think they're

00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,390
transitioning to become more

00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:28,070
a different kind of IP company than they

00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,570
were before in terms of the intellectual

00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:34,090
property is more important to them now

00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:34,090
than it was five years ago yes

00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:51,610
yeah no that's fun it's a good question

00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,440
and it helps you know I live in this

00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:56,620
world all the time so you be kind of

00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:01,240
catch me up to reality it's essentially

00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:03,130
an idea if you had an idea and you

00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,260
didn't and you put it in code but you

00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,750
didn't put it in some place that's

00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,850
searchable so that could serve as if

00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:12,460
there's prior art on something like I

00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:15,400
claim that I have the ability going back

00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:17,560
to my example from before this is a good

00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,860
one activesync is a patent that

00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,530
microsoft owns a series of ten patents

00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:26,860
any time your device your portable

00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:30,220
device sinks at the same time as your as

00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:31,690
your desktop there's a patent or a

00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,870
series of patents that cover that

00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:37,720
activity if I had published something

00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:40,420
three years prior to Microsoft filing

00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:43,180
the patents on activesync that said that

00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,880
this concept is something that I believe

00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:47,830
is possible and then can occur where

00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,720
when you have a device you have a

00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,450
synchronization activity that occurs in

00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,630
such in such a way that's prior art or

00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:57,340
you have a discovery to university that

00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:00,550
you put a paper out on and you've got a

00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:03,070
series of slides or you gotta pay you've

00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:06,400
done a formal paper that can all service

00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:10,690
prior art there's a there's a there's a

00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:13,960
site called IP com which is a repository

00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:15,550
for structured content that's where we

00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,900
will pay to have will take the

00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:19,960
equivalent of an electronic cocktail

00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:22,150
napkin turn it into a defensive

00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,310
publication and then pay for it to be

00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:26,080
hosted that's a site that's so that's

00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,580
list that's on it's a desktop click

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,800
through on every patent examiner's

00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,930
desktop in the world so that's what

00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,850
prior art is it's essentially a prior

00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:36,190
statement of an invention it doesn't

00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:38,500
have to be that detailed it's just you

00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,520
can do this this and this you can

00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,920
communicate between heterogeneous

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,290
networks you can create security that

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,730
requires somebody to send a message to

00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,140
somebody else that they're sending it

00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,910
and the other person to send a message

00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:51,910
back saying that they've that they're

00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:53,230
prepared to receive anything that you

00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:55,420
can think of you could think of a

00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:57,700
hundred a hundred things right now that

00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:00,110
go on every day in technology that we

00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:04,220
use and chances are there

01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:05,980
all covered by patents because whenever

01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:08,360
you create a product you're creating

01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,890
usually a set of patents of your a large

01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,630
company especially if you're an

01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:13,460
engineering company if your computer

01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,860
science driven company not so much

01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:18,260
because it's not part of the culture not

01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:33,440
part of the history any other questions

01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:35,510
I think we have one minute well you have

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,970
to have you have to have published the

01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:41,510
art in some way that made it accessible

01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:43,790
so if you kept it in a closed circuit so

01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:46,790
to speak of five or six people but it

01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:48,950
actually had no public availability then

01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:51,530
it wouldn't serve as effective prior art

01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:57,760
even though it did predate maybe the the

01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:57,760
invention sure

01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:25,789
I bet I didn't catch the beginning of

01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:28,460
the question sorry because the license

01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:31,369
actually we're creating community it's

01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:33,319
an attempt to kind of show unity and

01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:35,269
what we have instead of three hundred

01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:38,420
and seventy plus licensees and we have

01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:40,369
five thousand licensees the people on

01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,349
this side of the table and the people on

01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:44,539
this side of the table it starts to show

01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:46,400
that the world is shifted so we're

01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:49,220
looking for a palpable evidence a

01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,869
statement of people who are joining the

01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,119
community and ownership is very

01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:54,859
important to us because it also that's

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,900
why we don't contribute them to or

01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:59,779
pledge them somewhere like the Linux

01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:01,369
patent commons we need to ownership

01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:03,289
because then we have the ability to

01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:05,720
forward deploy them for defensive

01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:10,839
purposes then they have that additional

01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,839
benefit so anyway thank you very much

01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:29,309
what about this I can help you like it

01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:33,140
we have the same problem or whatever

01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:33,140
computers you gave me I found

01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:39,579
let's put the word out

01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,579
you

01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:54,090
as a service leader in cloud computing

01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:55,680
all we do is hosting computing to us the

01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:57,600
cloud is just the next generation of

01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,550
hosting and if someone who's been in the

01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,740
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:03,270
work in a unique position to really help

01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:05,250
bring these two worlds together these

01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:07,140
different sets of technologies and to

01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,480
help companies embrace this new world

01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,490
and this great new tool that allows

01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,070
faster innovation not only is it about

01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:19,470
us being responsive and accountable but

01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:22,310
it's about us doing more for you webos

01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:25,860
an OS that works the way that you do

01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:29,630
across all your devices HP Slate and
