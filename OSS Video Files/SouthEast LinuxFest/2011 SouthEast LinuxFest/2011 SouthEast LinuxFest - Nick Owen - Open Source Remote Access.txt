the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,870
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,349
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,349
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:47,460
Thank you Thank very much if first of

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,010
all thanks to the great organizers of

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,829
self for having a wonderful show here in

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,930
sparkle city once again having a great

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,420
time it's actually my talk is actually a

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,270
little bit policy light so we can

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,030
certainly go into that it's actually my

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,589
whole talk is actually kind of light but

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,479
we have it's about 30 minutes so

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,580
there'll be plenty of time for questions

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,170
and discussion you can interrupt me if

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,580
you want or you can wait till the end

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,340
I'm I'm Nick Owen you can get me on

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,159
Twitter at wicked systems it's my

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,369
corporate account and we're on pound

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,740
wicked on freenode as well everything I

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,979
talk about is we have copies of it on

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,970
our website so i recommend if you you

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,430
know don't worry too much about the

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,920
details get to get the vibe of the whole

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:41,490
thing i'm going to talk about securing

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,649
your network with open source

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,329
technologies and trying to meet some

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,729
policies and regulations that you might

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,070
need to there's a little bit of

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,399
philosophy and strategy a little bit of

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,430
specifics and hopefully it's enough to

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,610
get you guys really interested in

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,469
increasing your security so who

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,759
remembers the good old days you know

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,189
when you had a firewall that meant you

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,590
were secure it wasn't actually that long

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,899
ago and it was quite easy you might get

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,379
a virus but that was sort of it you know

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,140
the only attacks really the bad guy

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,950
could do would be in

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:21,700
the middle attack it was it was a pretty

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,400
simple sort of threat landscape today

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,930
though it's different you still have to

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,240
have your firewall it may not be doing

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,090
as much good as it used to but you still

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,560
need it your users could be at a

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,410
starbucks over a Wi-Fi connection of

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,780
some sort you might be deploying google

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,209
apps and your users would actually be

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,700
you know potentially attacked between

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,410
google apps and the wife the starbucks

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,680
Wi-Fi connection and you wouldn't even

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,650
know it so it's a much more complex

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,239
threat landscape today than it was in

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,680
the past additionally you might have

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,830
some security services that you're using

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,590
outside of your firewall as an example

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,910
you might be using SMS for

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,260
authentication and there are a lot of

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,730
people doing this and I think they're

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,190
doing it without realizing that they've

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,410
changed their threat landscape so now

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,440
your SMS carrier is in the middle of

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:18,640
your threat landscape and if you are

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,709
AT&T and you made it slightly harder to

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,269
reset a password you're going to

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,030
increase your help desk calls by

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,070
millions so they're not in scented in

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,329
any way to increase the security of

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,950
their SMS system I think if anyone and I

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,329
think particularly I pick on on AT&T but

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,540
you should ask Jeremy sands how he feels

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:40,600
about eighteen t this weekend so it's a

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,980
lot it's a lot more complex and what I

00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,760
think one thing you need to do today is

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,610
really think about your is that too loud

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,980
just me okay think about the threat

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,299
landscape and what you're doing what

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,610
people didn't really realize was that

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,500
RSA was doing authentication as a

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,260
service the service they were providing

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,610
was not leaking the shared secrets until

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,010
they got attacked and leaked to shared

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,400
secrets so these things are worthwhile

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,170
considering but it's not just the threat

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,630
landscape that's changed right who here

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:15,130
is a with a company that's under pci or

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:17,350
HIPAA or sox compliance so there are a

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,630
lot of things that i'm personally of the

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,750
opinion so there's the debates about pci

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,610
is it is it creating a ceiling or is it

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,200
a floor i'm seeing a lot of people that

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,760
are coming up to the floor so overall i

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,900
think it's a good thing

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,850
particularly when credit cards are

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,270
involved but there's some things you

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:37,030
would do for PCI compliance or

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,010
compliance that are beyond security in

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,360
addition to all this in addition to all

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,700
the stuff you've got to secure you've

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,990
got your users involved right and so

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,150
that could be problematic as well

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,610
because the users are also in a world of

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,340
pain these days they've got passwords

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,050
for facebook they've got passports for

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,570
sony playstation they've got passwords

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,300
for Gawker Media just to name a couple

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,500
of them someone did a study recently of

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,570
the passwords from Sony and the

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,430
passwords from gawker media and found

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,170
that an astounding percentage of them

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,780
were reused to cost across just those

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,870
two properties so you know clearly

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,610
passwords are a 20th century technology

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,600
and it's time for change and luckily

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,710
there are some solutions for that so

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,880
philosophically we're going to try and

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,550
get you into a better state right

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,110
because in general from a security

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,200
perspective things are pretty rough

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,360
right now I want you to think about

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,120
balance one of the things we've tried to

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,010
do is to you know take strong strong

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
authentication historically has been

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,470
fairly expensive and fairly difficult to

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,900
use bringing down the expense gives you

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:45,790
budget to do other stuff which gives you

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:48,940
a better balance keep it simple I'm sure

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,680
you guys are probably managing some

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,760
legacy code that you would have

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,620
preferred have been architected

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,060
differently so think about the next guy

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,970
that comes in and needs to manage your

00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,740
network but in general will talk a lot

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,150
about protocols and how if you really

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,540
limit yourself in the protocol world

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,680
you'll get a lot more flexibility

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,090
defense-in-depth there's a lot of stuff

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,370
we could do here I could cover you know

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,570
go on well you could go to information

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,180
security conference here about all this

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,010
stuff but in general you know you want

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,480
strong authentication you want encrypted

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,980
tunnels that are strong motor krypter

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,950
data you want to monitor you want to

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,300
backup you want to log and you know

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,890
that's really what you need to do

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,200
because if you have something that the

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,380
attacker wants to get chances are they

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,110
can get what you want to do is minimize

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,890
the amount of time they have to do that

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,960
minimize their ability to get out and

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,000
just always keep in mind that you know

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,080
the value of your data is probably

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,930
staying the same or inquiry

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,099
saying the cost of attacks is dropping

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,050
and I'm a big believer in optimization

00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,580
to write so I think I think this is

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,409
probably preaching to the choir because

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,979
linux enthusiasts are very good at

00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:58,419
getting a lot for very little but

00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:01,180
automation is key and I've got a couple

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:05,319
of tips and tricks for a while one tip

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,789
one tip for automation so let's talk

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,840
about strong authentication this is

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:12,610
really my area I guess if expertise if

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,199
you're not looking at doing some

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:20,050
proprietary system then certs and keys

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,669
are two options certificates have been

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,409
an option for a long long time and

00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,599
nobody has done them so there's

00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,069
obviously some issues around that I

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,229
think management has been a big

00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,389
nightmare for them managing whitelist

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,159
and blacklist is quite difficult but

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,539
from a health standpoint it's not quite

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,879
there either you know there's offline

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,500
brute force attacks of the passphrase so

00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,449
if someone gets the certificate they can

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,039
spend all day dictionary brute-forcing

00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,949
attacking it and when they get it

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,569
they're in do you know there's a

00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,219
passphrase what's the quality of the

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,310
passphrase actually now that I think

00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:54,789
about this is kind of dated you know a

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,710
gpu-based password cracker will destroy

00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,509
it by any kind of passphrase so no

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,069
matter how complex your pass face is if

00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:04,300
you've got a GPU cluster you can break

00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:07,060
it and you can rent them so pretty much

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,400
everyone has one to me the real issue

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,770
here from enterprise standpoint is

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,440
integration across applications you know

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,379
you might be able to use sorts very

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,969
easily for a web app but what about SSH

00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,979
what about your VPN what if you want to

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:23,889
switch your VPN from a cisco to a

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:26,529
Juniper well they still work so there's

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,699
a lot of pain and you know even if

00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:29,589
therefore even if you roll your own

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,769
certificate authority there's there can

00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,120
be a lot of pain SSH keys this is

00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,680
another great example I'm going to love

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,579
them it's a great technology use them

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,289
all the time but their audit issues is

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:43,539
there really a passphrase what's the key

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,600
expiration system you know the new

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,270
versions of openssh will require a

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,760
client that has a passphrase but do you

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,949
know how long the passphrase is do you

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
know that someone hasn't recompiled the

00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:57,170
client

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,569
to say that it has a passphrase when it

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:04,279
doesn't and I guess the other issue with

00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,990
ssh and search as well is that one of

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,399
the things i recommend in a policy

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,649
should have is have all your users in

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,249
one place even if that's active

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:16,490
directory so it's very easy to disable

00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:19,399
your users and ideally i recommend that

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,939
you have HR disabled users rather than

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:26,839
assisted min so that the control is

00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:28,009
really where it needs to be so obviously

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,720
consider the source I'm a little bit

00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:32,089
biased but I think one-time passwords or

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,860
what you need to be looking at and

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:37,279
primarily that's because passwords work

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,699
everywhere right every application has a

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,279
prompt for a username and password

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:45,920
pretty much so all you really need to do

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,680
then is focus on the back end I want an

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,360
application that will work with with my

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,889
systems so this is the question we get

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,110
quite a lot right which is you know do

00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,970
you work with my we work with my cisco

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,670
we work with my juniper we work with my

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,370
Citrix set up and it's a valid question

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,809
right you want stuff that works but I

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,490
would like for you to take a little bit

00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:11,300
more of a strategic approach for it and

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,939
have really thought about what your

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,410
network topology should be and come and

00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:18,680
come to the conclusion that OES well

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,199
mais network mind my networking protocol

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,730
for authentication is radius I see the G

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:27,139
support radius so there would be no

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:29,480
problems correct because really at the

00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:32,779
network protocol layer that's where you

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,730
want to have your standards this will

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,100
allow you to swap equipment very easily

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,860
and it won't really matter whether using

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,240
Open VPN or a cisco because you can

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,370
change those out without what out

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:51,649
without having to significantly rework

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:53,300
your your network so there's I guess a

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,759
couple of options to your taxes in here

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,319
we support tax plus it's really a Cisco

00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,870
proprietary protocol if you have a lot

00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:02,209
of switches and networking equipment you

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,009
may be familiar with it but there's not

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,870
really much open source support for it

00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,620
because of the fact that it's a Cisco

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,040
proprietary protocol

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,950
I prefer radius will talk about radius a

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,610
good bet ldap is lightweight only in

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:19,020
relation to x509 in my opinion and while

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,600
I would love to say hey listen if you

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,490
only use one pro networking protocol in

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,140
your network you'll be rock solid and

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,529
point of fact you probably won't be able

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,880
to and that's because if you moved any

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,040
kind of cloud services you'll have to

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,690
use something like Samuel and Samuel is

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,089
one of those standards where everybody

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:41,520
can be compliant and nobody would still

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:44,750
work together so I've got a little one

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,500
little piece about SSO for y'all as well

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,600
why do I like radius because it's simple

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,940
it just works you really typically need

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,110
only three pieces of information the

00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,690
server the port which is 1812 UDP and a

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,250
shared secret radius is an encoded

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:07,320
protocol so this is really a LAN

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,130
protocol it's a very standard standard

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,760
you can you know it'll work with pfsense

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:17,760
it will work with you know Cisco juniper

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,580
Citrix it just it just works you can

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,320
start off with your openvpn server and

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,720
if you grow to need more you can plop in

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,750
a Cisco or a juniper box and and you're

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,820
good to go it's simple but you can't

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,589
expand it through access control lists

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,800
and return attributes you could do a lot

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:36,990
with radius and free radius is a great

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,459
open source product radiator is another

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,670
one so there's some really good

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:45,240
enterprise-level inexpensive options out

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,130
there I say even Microsoft supports raid

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,779
us off now that that's kind of a bit of

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:54,320
unfair they've been supporting since

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:56,850
2003 the ability to accept radius

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,510
packets and proxy them to a third-party

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,839
server so you can have your pfsense BSD

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,570
firewall send radius packets to your

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,150
Active Directory server in the IAS or

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,589
NPS plugin validate that the user is

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,480
active in active directory and in the

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,220
proper group and if so it will send it

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,440
to your linux based two-factor

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,800
authentication server and I think that's

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,800
pretty cool

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,740
so I'm going to talk about a little bit

00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,360
specifics here I've got two tricks

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,020
really that'll help you get a lot done

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,280
in your network the first one is Pam how

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,740
many people have played with Pam files

00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:38,110
before did you like it or did you hate

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,670
it yeah so after this week of struggling

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,640
with some Pam requests from customers

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,370
I'm kind of not on the love side so much

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,900
anymore but if you can figure it out and

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,140
get it working don't ever make any

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,200
changes again it's great you can really

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,350
do a lot with Pam SSH obviously but sue

00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:00,760
do as well it's a highly recommend you

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,190
can even do login SFTP a lot of services

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,710
I set up a jabber server with two factor

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,990
authentication once so anything that you

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,100
need to do you can probably find a free

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:16,930
and open source version that supports

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:20,860
Pamela dedication and you know this is a

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:25,090
very simple setup we will I'll just go

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:27,130
through it and we can we can talk a

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,130
little bit about the details but it's

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,100
it's it can be tough to set up but at a

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,260
basic level it's pretty simple right I

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,120
typically download the source from the

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,910
freeradius home page and do a config

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,930
make make install there is a Deb for

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:47,950
Boone too I know but the compilation is

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,440
pretty easy and you get basically one

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,870
shared object that gets put into lib /

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,030
security and you get a configuration

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,910
file and in that configuration file you

00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:00,250
put your three pieces of information

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:03,190
this server IP address the shared secret

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,720
and a timeout you can chain these two so

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,660
you can have more than one so if one

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,010
fails it'll go to the next one and then

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,700
you edit your etsy Pandey service file

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,450
typically with something like all

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,550
sufficient which means that if they pass

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,160
the radius piece that's all they need to

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,460
do their different options include

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,960
required requisite it is a little bit

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:32,350
different across each distro so there

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,470
are complexities but in general it works

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:38,980
pretty well we did just figure out on

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,810
friday i got a message from my CTO there

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,740
we had one customer that wanted to use

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:48,850
both a one-time passcode and a Kerberos

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,860
request to ad so you would get to

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,900
password prompts and we figured that out

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,580
it was not you know it was not easy to

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,940
do but when you get it it's good to go

00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,010
so you can do a lot with it for example

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,770
you can set up openvpn how many people

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,120
have played with openvpn how many people

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:09,280
have deployed it internally at like an

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,900
organization okay good so this is you

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,490
know the in the in the openvpn

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,260
enterprise version it's got radius

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,680
support built in so you can just drop in

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,080
your your IP address and shared secret

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,570
you're good to go on the open source

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,520
version it's Pam sport until you create

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,440
your service file pretty much just a

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,870
copy of the one we just did on the

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,870
client side you tell the user to prompt

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,150
for a password and on the server side

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,670
you tell it to use the of the pan plugin

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,710
and tell it the name of the service file

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,650
that you created and that's it that's

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,690
all you have to do so the benefits of

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,690
this is once again all your users in the

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,880
same place and if HR fires somebody in

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,490
accounting and deletes them out of your

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,550
directory they are no longer able to get

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,350
in remotely yeah you should not let your

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,420
accounts pile up in other places but in

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:02,890
general you know deactivation is a very

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,300
important thing additionally now because

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,860
you're using two-factor authentication

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:11,560
for your identification you can use the

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,150
same search for each user so you no

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,340
longer have to do the search management

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,270
piece your search are only being used

00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,620
for encryption so you can you can get

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,000
rid of that piece of management if you

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,810
choose or you can do belts and

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,580
suspenders so it makes sense am I going

00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,580
too fast are you all hungover

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,049
we get a lot of ssh discussions and one

00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,850
of our customers who managed a lot of

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:40,640
boxes decided to set up an ssh gateway

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,070
box i thought it's a great idea they

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,620
basically off all the users to the

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,470
gateway box via two-factor

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,899
authentication and that box is very well

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,429
locked down and they've got their keys

00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:54,799
on it there so they can manage all the

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,019
other boxes from there so they can go to

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,940
the other boxes via basically a kind of

00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:00,890
ssh single sign-on or they can run

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,350
commands from that box across all the

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,630
different servers there's no password

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,039
file in the gateway box obviously you

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,929
need to be concerned about the keys but

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,950
that's about it and if you're really

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:16,490
concerned about the boxes they're

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:19,210
working on you could do sue do require

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,049
sue do for a second one-time passcode

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,179
with WIC and you can actually do that

00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:27,080
via a separate domain so you can have

00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:29,389
one wicked domain to get a one-time

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,169
password for just for the remote access

00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:35,529
and another one for sis admins I think

00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,909
this is a really important piece because

00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:40,789
attacks all involve escalation and

00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:42,409
privilege and one of the things that I

00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,899
really like about linux is the fact that

00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,549
you can do this with Sue due to my

00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:52,250
knowledge you can't do that with run as

00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:54,110
on a windows box and it's all about

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,340
slowing down the attacker right so when

00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:01,850
you start seeing you know pin attempts

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:07,100
on a pseudo protected box that's going

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:10,309
to be a big tip off so one of the things

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,760
I like to stress is that if you can give

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,860
the user something that they want and

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,139
lock it down with more security it's a

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,120
win-win situation and I think remote

00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:21,740
desktop is one of those things because

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,039
if it's easy for them to get the same

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,740
user interface that they do at work at

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:33,139
home or wherever that makes it easier

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,730
for them free NX is well no machine is

00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:38,690
an Italian company they released the NX

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,850
protocol as open source and free and X

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,590
is the result of that it's in both it's

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,240
in all the repositories

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,640
it's a really awesome product it's a

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,140
little bit long in the tooth all of the

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,510
bug fixes are now being done by the main

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,950
maintain errs but it's pretty you know

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,630
pretty rock solid and it works pretty

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,539
well there are a couple of newer

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,720
projects out their tac-x and need X need

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,919
X is actually backed by Google I don't

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,830
know what I don't really have an update

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:09,559
on those projects but no machine also

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,270
has a commercial version there's a free

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,010
for two users and if you really want

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,470
some enterprise capabilities it's a

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,950
pretty reasonable price what do you get

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,720
with it remote X VNC rdp desktop sharing

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,549
session shadowing you get quite a lot

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,279
with it and it's all tunneled through

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,809
ssh alright so again you're using a very

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,210
standard protocol for encrypting the

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,700
tunnel which is nice and it uses Pam for

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,960
authentication so there you go or the

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,789
connection to Pam through to your

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,610
standard networking protocol we deployed

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:42,529
this at a university that had their

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:46,640
credit card processing services on

00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:49,130
Windows and so to me it was a nice way

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,770
for them to get secured access through

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:55,429
VNC it was actually a lot faster for

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:59,330
them to do it they'd later upgraded to a

00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:01,309
festa cell-based VPN but again that was

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,990
an option for them that you know when

00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:08,270
they had the budget and this was an

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:10,669
option when they did here's a nice plug

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,529
for postgres which I'm a big fan of you

00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,960
can actually have postgres use Pamela

00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:17,299
dedication so if you have critical data

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,309
in your database you can lock it down be

00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,840
a two-factor authentication again

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:22,120
imagine you know you have to come into

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,470
the network two-factor authentication

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,600
maybe you have to sue do to get into it

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,669
but what you want to do is protect the

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,820
data and if the data is in Postgres this

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,289
would be a big tip on for you big help

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,760
and there's a slight diggin my sequel I

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,450
don't know I guess I'm bitter today but

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,809
my sequel does not support Pam alright

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:46,039
the second tip is Apache how many people

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:50,899
know about apache it's good just make

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:52,010
sure wig I love Apache you know it is it

00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,710
is one of those things where there's a

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,240
big honkin config file but it's pretty

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,920
easy to configure

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,980
and if you get HTTP authentication

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,600
working you'll get a lot right so most

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:08,559
content management systems web dev

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:13,040
webmail wordpress ph BB all of these

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,150
routinely attacked web applications can

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,800
be protected with two factor

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:23,150
authentication on the Red Hat front and

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:25,370
Fodor front is modeled radius and model

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:29,030
x radius you typically have to compile

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:31,250
it from source but it's not too bad on a

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,880
bun to its apt-get install lib apache

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,490
model of radius so it's quite easy

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,559
ubuntu on I mean apache on ubuntu has to

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,660
config files and the first one you tell

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,510
it to use radius or you specify your

00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,840
radius server port and shared secret and

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,010
a timeout and you set a cookie because

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,330
if you don't set a cookie then each

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,429
element of your page will be

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,020
authenticated and your one-time passcode

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:59,150
will quickly fail and your user will be

00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:02,150
disabled and then all you do is protect

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,890
some area right location location match

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,710
file match directory virtual host

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,929
authtype basic auth basic provider or

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,410
ratings I've got another example about

00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:15,620
ldap tube restart apache and you're good

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:18,400
to go it's actually very easy as an

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:24,700
example for wordpress they have an HTTP

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:28,010
authentication plugin so activate that

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:34,420
and if you want to just protect the

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:37,460
administration you protect WP login and

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,040
WP admin and that's all you need to do

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,190
and you know most of the attacks against

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,910
WordPress are to you know post spam or

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:49,910
malware within privileges so this goes a

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:53,080
long way to preventing that obviously

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,080
you still need to update your WordPress

00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:59,690
this is one we recently did using model

00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:02,630
ldap you can tell there's a lot less

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,450
simplicity here but sec you bus is an

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:09,149
open source project for automating and

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,279
managing your scans

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:15,089
so it works with Nessus and open vas and

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,669
knit co2 you know basically chron your

00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:21,259
scans and manage your logs it's a pretty

00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:24,419
neat little project it's on sourceforge

00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:30,179
and they're on Twitter at SEC euless as

00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:33,389
well so you know this one thing you

00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:36,089
don't want to expose is a intruder

00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:38,429
getting your scans from a place where

00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:39,779
you're allowing scans from so blocking

00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:41,669
it down two-factor authentication i

00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,749
think is quite a good idea this could be

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:45,330
you could score sort of see this as

00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:48,289
being the open source clause l familiar

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,519
with koalas koalas is a cloud-based

00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:52,259
vulnerability scanner there's another

00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,320
one called not sick as well and I think

00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,909
you know with scanning it's kind of a

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,469
good idea to have multiple scans anyway

00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,629
because different scanners will find

00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:03,089
different things but again automate it

00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:09,440
keep it simple and your life will be a

00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:11,639
lot easier so how many people are doing

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,169
often like google apps are moving to

00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:23,369
google apps or any kind of salesforce

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:25,320
type of okay so one of the you know

00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:28,009
again with the idea of making your life

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,299
simpler for your users while rolling out

00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:32,669
increased security I think single sign

00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:34,799
on is a big opportunity for that because

00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:38,249
you know users are as tired of passwords

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,570
as sisson bands are we were recently

00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:41,729
approached by kind of called 8 record

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,139
that manages and runs the jaw so open

00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:45,960
source project the java open source

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:48,330
single sign-on solution I've played with

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,580
a number of open source solutions for

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:55,489
sso like opens open SSO which was the

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:58,229
Sun one now with rock forge and kaz the

00:25:55,489 --> 00:26:01,139
CAS came from centralized authentication

00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:03,719
server open sort the openssl one I you

00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:05,190
know got it spun up and running and

00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:07,529
couldn't figure it out I mean it was

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,779
just so complex and of course you know

00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:13,349
everything an identity has some various

00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:15,239
specific yet vague thing right so it's a

00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:17,009
service provider interface or it is an

00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,809
identity provider interface and like

00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,210
what you know what is the difference

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,559
between those doing

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,799
but openssl I just couldn't figure out

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,150
it all cazza actually got running once

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,630
using radius but then couldn't get it

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:33,780
running again with this I was a

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,390
basically able to spin up their identity

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:42,360
appliance it's a software download its

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:45,000
osgi based you get this GUI modeler the

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,520
console I was able to create an identity

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,380
provider I used one of their built-in ID

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,850
vaults which instead of Active Directory

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,299
but that's where the users would go i

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:56,640
created a tomcat test and they actually

00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,590
you can specify that at build a build an

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,110
app so it actually built the app for me

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,360
to test on and then I dropped in wicked

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,870
for two factor authentication and it was

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,789
done it's you know yeah there's a little

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:12,600
bit of complexity because I think SSO

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:14,280
does have its own language and you know

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,669
if you're in a big Enterprise this is

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,070
going to get complex quickly but it was

00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:24,450
just an absolute breeze to get the base

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:27,750
started and they've built in the the

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:32,130
connector there is actually are using RW

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:33,570
off protocol so it is a it's a you get a

00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,360
network line on the liquid server and

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,220
you get a certificate so it is SSL

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,289
protected so you could actually run your

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,760
wicked server back home you could put

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:43,620
this in the cloud if you wanted to and

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,380
all of the authentication requests would

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,880
be tunneled they've got built-in support

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:53,539
for Google Apps Salesforce and sugar crm

00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:57,360
as well as you know all sorts of apache

00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:59,429
websphere jboss tomcat stuff like that

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,070
so if you're running a lot of web apps

00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:04,669
internally or looking at moving

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:08,309
externally this is a great way to

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:11,669
increase security and keep your users

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:14,610
happy a lot of people I think are going

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:17,280
to be real nervous putting stuff on

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,260
google apps and realizing that it's SSL

00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,610
and a username and password that's

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,990
securing it at the same time I think a

00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,570
lot of enterprises are going to be more

00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:31,399
secure with that because you know

00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,399
securing exchange server is

00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:39,830
difficult in my opinion because of

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:43,519
exchange is sort of a piece of so

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:46,490
that's it you know it's really a you

00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:50,090
know used use standard tunnels use

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:53,630
two-factor authentication strategically

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,700
choose a networking protocol and try to

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,029
think about making your users happy

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:05,320
while increasing security as well as the

00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:05,320
auditors any questions

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,220
yeah so we've got a lot of and also we

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,350
do a lot on how to forge net as well so

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,770
I've got a actually the tutorial for jaw

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:24,429
so is actually on how to forge but we'll

00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:27,490
move it to our website as well and so

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:33,580
all of the config files and like we've

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:38,549
got examples for Apache I'm sorry Pam

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:41,200
for Kubuntu and for redhat flavors and

00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:45,400
lots of stuff a lot in fact a lot of

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,510
little bit old but all of the how-to

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,510
information is there

00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,670
you

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:07,470
what are my thoughts about Kerberos um

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:09,960
you know it's we don't use Active

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:13,620
Directory internally but it is I think a

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:23,460
very good protocol and you know we don't

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:25,320
support it in wicked but the way the way

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,390
it would really the way I would think

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,110
about doing that is to find a Kerberos

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:33,840
server that supported radius as an

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:41,190
authentication method and to my

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:42,840
knowledge I have not found that the are

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,670
you running Kerberos as a directory

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:52,490
server or you are you running it

00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:55,590
internally to talk to a Dior all right i

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,940
guess my worry there is so what would

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:08,940
you use what are using as a directory

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:11,460
server uh-huh i would think a lot about

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,890
what you want to authenticate to because

00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,890
will your firewall talk kerberos

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:28,980
yeah yeah I you know I have to say that

00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,200
I haven't really looked at it that much

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,760
we probably had too much call for it so

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,850
I'd be worried that is it you know is it

00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,380
really going to be supported by our

00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:39,450
buyer by the devices we want to deploy

00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,789
and that's why I find radius to be a

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,140
little bit a little bit better but like

00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:44,929
I said we've got this one customer

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,370
that's doing both radius and kerberos

00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:48,929
but they're just really using that to

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:54,570
talk back to ad I think so they could

00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:56,460
just use ldap as well is it supported

00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:02,370
under mca's radius supported under mac

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:08,600
OS for what Pam like you talk about OS

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:08,600
servers or or

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:21,260
I'm sorry we're doing abs for doing ok

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,160
so in other words someone logs into a

00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:35,600
mac and can they can it end single sign

00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:39,620
on to your directory we don't do a lot

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,270
with we're getting more and more

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:45,080
questions about hiking you can you

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:46,730
change the window authentication and you

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,800
know which basically means you're a

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:53,210
custom Gina we don't do a lot of that

00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,180
there's a project called p Gina that

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,880
that will get replace the Gina with

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,060
something it will talk radius on the Mac

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,550
front I would think that if it's running

00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:08,350
that if it's running Pam that you could

00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:18,460
do that but I honestly don't know I

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:18,460
don't know any other questions yes

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:35,960
yes well for one thing on our what what

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:39,500
did my reservations about tack X plus on

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,040
our side our tax interface is a little

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:46,520
bit kludgy there there's a open-source

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,770
tax server project called I don't know

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,180
what it's called but it's called tack

00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,840
plus or something like that at shrubbery

00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:57,080
net and we're using their code to do our

00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,380
plug-in but their code only works off of

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,790
a configuration file so it's meant for

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:07,960
static passwords so we rewrite that file

00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:11,210
every time someone requests a passcode

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:15,560
and so what that means is that that

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:18,380
passcode is actually valid until that's

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,060
that file is overwritten right so it's

00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,659
over written every minute or so but

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,190
technically it's not a one-time passcode

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,560
so the lack of because it's a

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,800
proprietary protocol there's a lack of

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,260
open source solutions that support it

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,080
that's my that's my big issue at the

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,840
same time I was we did this with a

00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,550
customer that had a lot of devices they

00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,990
wanted to manage the attack acts they

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,480
could only do the attack acts and

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,340
basically he said we had by far the best

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,070
tax interface and server and support

00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,570
than anything anything you'd ever seen

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:56,080
you know you can actually you can put in

00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:58,730
custom information into the file as well

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,960
you know apparently it's the best thing

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:08,210
since you know sliced bread but and we

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,410
just don't we don't see a lot any other

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,930
questions are y'all formula are y'all

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:19,000
following the lulz sack security on

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:21,770
twitter no le lulz security they just

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,540
hacked a bunch of porn sites posted the

00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,640
admin passwords and ivory ones user name

00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:29,750
and emails including a number of mill

00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:32,330
and gov email addresses and they're

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:39,440
doing it just for fun

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:42,190
just for the walls when else is

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,090
everybody familiar with the RSA breach

00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,500
there's no one heard about the RSA

00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:53,360
breach has someone not heard by the arts

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:56,140
average so RSA is the leading provider

00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,480
of Hardware tokens 40 million of them

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,070
they take a the hardware is basically a

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,320
shared secret system so there's a shared

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,630
secret there's an algorithm which is

00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,690
known it's a I think it's based on aes

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,880
and the time it takes those things and

00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:15,220
and generates a six digit random random

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,660
number on the server side there is the

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,180
shared secret the same algorithm and the

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:24,740
time you know they if the time gets lost

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:28,460
there's offsets and stuff like that RSA

00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:31,130
maintains a copy of these seeds have

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:35,000
read that that's for a prior recovery

00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,290
capability but also licensing someone

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,930
which they termed as an advanced

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:44,540
persistent threat which means the

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:49,340
Chinese fish spear fish one of their

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:52,280
users the user actually got a excel file

00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:57,110
out of the spam folder and open it up it

00:36:52,280 --> 00:37:01,220
had a zero-day they then escalated into

00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:02,900
an admin account and got information

00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:08,270
that was said to reduce the

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:13,220
effectiveness of secure ID but that it

00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:16,310
was they felt because it was limited to

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:21,620
specific targets they told everyone not

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:23,090
to panic except for those targets you

00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,990
can only find out details about the

00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:32,390
breach by signing an NDA lo and behold a

00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:35,660
couple weeks ago lockheed martin shut

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:38,390
down the remote access issued new

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,830
passwords to everybody and didn't say

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,800
much about it but then issued new

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,570
security tokens then l3 another large

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,800
defense contractor was attacked they

00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,980
said it was there based on

00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,460
RSA keys and then Northrop Grumman said

00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,660
oh they were attacked as well and I

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,020
guess it just didn't occur to anybody

00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,670
that if our essay was keeping copies of

00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,850
the seeds they were also part of the

00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:05,720
threat landscape RSA is said that you

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:08,380
can request to replacement tokens and

00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,360
some people are doing that are you know

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:15,440
and I guess some people are switching

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,790
but you know the the premise that only

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,130
certain people will be attacked by this

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,800
I think is is misleading at best because

00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,300
if I were the Chinese I'd be saying okay

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,430
let's cover our tracks here let's get

00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,780
some plausible deniability by sharing

00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,290
this with the hacker underground and

00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:34,460
getting some other tax going you know or

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:38,830
if it's you know and I don't know why

00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:40,940
you would replace the same architecture

00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,950
you know because basically what are este

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,810
is going to say now is yeah where it'll

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,090
never happen again we got a new we got a

00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:48,890
hardware security module now that's good

00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,960
we got this awesome half-million-dollar

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,730
or whatever hardware security bylaws and

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,040
everyone's like what we're using before

00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:59,720
yeah my guess is it was on a Windows

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,010
machine so it's interesting times as

00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:08,300
everyone familiar what's going on with

00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:09,800
sony sony has been the playstation

00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:15,320
network has been down for months now it

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,730
seems like playstation network back up

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,030
everywhere except for japan now

00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,450
protecting their own i guess any other

00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,450
questions

00:39:35,400 --> 00:40:29,849
okay uh-huh Oh God Yeah Yeah right right

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,599
yeah

00:40:42,270 --> 00:41:00,280
yeah so if you will just call the talk

00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:04,630
over and now welcome to the wicked sales

00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,130
pitch so we have two versions we have an

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,320
enterprise version and a commercial in a

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,700
open source version the difference is in

00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,470
the enterprise version we use

00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,570
third-party libraries for a couple of

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,700
things one is the radius interface and

00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,670
the other one is the encryption that we

00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:23,500
use for the wireless tokens so we have

00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:26,710
pc tokens that are open source for mac

00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,630
linux and windows another company

00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:31,570
hurricane labs we wrote their own in

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:34,060
python to use for because they used a

00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:37,950
lot of ssh so you can feel free to write

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:42,550
your own then we have iphone ipad

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:44,110
android windows mobile but we are

00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:48,400
currently rewriting to upgrade to

00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:50,020
windows mobile seven and j2me and they

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,620
use a third-party encryption library

00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:59,740
that is blindingly fast the server is

00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:02,620
you know we've got rpms we have debs and

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:07,450
we have an ISO and the ISO basically is

00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:09,100
for the well it's it's easy but it's

00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,200
also geared towards the windows admin

00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,670
person who doesn't really know linux you

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,380
run a set up give it up give it an IP

00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,060
address it's got everything you need and

00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:20,020
then it's a web interface from there on

00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,880
out the server sports ldap radius tax

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,840
and then we have an API that's very

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,840
simple but very powerful for multi

00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:32,170
tenant solutions so like we are seeing a

00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,580
lot more noppe sec is a cuales

00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,730
competitor that does scanning and

00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,620
they're running it in the cloud and you

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,410
can actually build applications to allow

00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:48,610
other management of users by your

00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:50,260
customers it's we price it on a per user

00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,400
per year subscription with a three-year

00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,930
discount

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,980
and you know support it and all that

00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,319
stuff I'm not sure of answers your

00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:06,910
questions but undoubtedly it would work

00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:09,779
with your software download it play with

00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,779
it give us feedback

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:30,500
we never used SMS but yeah um you know

00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:33,300
we look so we looked at using SMS and

00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,710
like wouldn't that be easy but there was

00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:39,240
really no way to guarantee the security

00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:43,770
of it because you don't really know if

00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,270
it's encrypted and you know the carriers

00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,910
are not intended in any way to add

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:50,940
encryption to their SMS messages so you

00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:55,110
face issues around you know the client

00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,480
the carrier the carrier's admin you know

00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:00,510
the ability of the carrier to manage

00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,190
their users we've always used a public

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,140
key encryption with the keys generated

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,790
on the device we actually started out

00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,860
with those old nextel java phones you

00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:10,410
know Nextel had the first talk about a

00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,600
great company that got killed neck still

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:14,010
had a great system with java phones they

00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,690
even had an app store had

00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:25,740
enterprise-class capabilities for

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:27,480
managing it that was our first device so

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,250
when the so the way it works is that the

00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,080
you know the public to private key pairs

00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,600
of General on the device there's a key

00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,520
pair exchanged and then the user sets

00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,330
their pin and they get back a

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,880
registration code so the the accounts

00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,230
created on this on the on the server but

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,190
it's not there's no user name associated

00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,900
with it after the keeper after that they

00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,060
if once that registration code comes

00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,220
back to the server in some form or

00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,370
fashion either you know I know the admin

00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,230
says hey yes this is the user or the

00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,790
user goes in we actually provide some

00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,170
scripts where the user can login with

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,060
Active Directory credentials on the land

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,280
and give the registration code and then

00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,410
register their own tokens each user can

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,840
have more than one token right because

00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:13,080
this is public/private key pairs so you

00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,150
can have more than one token which is

00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,230
kind of nice we spent a lot of time

00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,460
working on making it easy for you to

00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,750
create new users and manage users

00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,370
because that's really a lot of the

00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,370
expense around two factor authentication

00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:30,950
how many people have have deployed

00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,950
two-factor authentication

00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:42,750
let's get that number let's get that

00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:46,280
number up anything else enjoy the rest

00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,280
of the show thank you very much

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,120
what about this I can help you like it

00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:16,740
we have the same problem what would

00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,740
happen to do you think

00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,560
this is

00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:23,620
let's put the word out

00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,620
you

00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:38,120
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,710
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,630
cloud is just the next generation of

00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,610
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,560
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,730
we're in a unique position to really

00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,860
help bring these two worlds together

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,170
these different sets of technologies and

00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,510
to help companies embrace this new world

00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,520
in this great new tool that allows

00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:58,100
faster innovation not only is it about

00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:03,500
us being responsive and accountable but

00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:06,340
it's about us doing more for you webos

00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,890
an OS that works the way that you do

00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:14,050
across all your devices HP Slate and

00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,050
