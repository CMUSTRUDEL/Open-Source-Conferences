the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,870
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,380
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,869
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,610
pc-bsd is going at cedric's i know a lot

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,710
of people in the linux world that are

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,090
familiar with bsd but not necessarily

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,800
running it and knowing what's going on

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,670
there first of all show hands how many

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,789
people have actually run freebsd okay so

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,100
there's a fair amount pc-bsd okay so we

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,809
got a couple as well okay excellent so

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,160
some of this may be you know old hat to

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,390
you you may have heard this but then

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,559
some of the new stuff at the end you'll

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,610
want to stick around Forks we'll talk

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,079
about where we're going with pc-bsd so

00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,670
the first question I always get asked

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,300
when I come to a Linux conferences what

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,650
is pc-bsd and there are a couple things

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,540
we need to answer first first of all

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,380
what is BSD that's usually what

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,670
somebody's really asking and a couple of

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,530
my favorite things I like to answer

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,479
first of all it's not a fork of Linux

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,400
the first question I get usually is what

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,350
distribution are you you based off a su

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,180
SE or red hat or a bun too I mean

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,759
where'd you come from we're not a flavor

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,890
of linux and we're not a distribution so

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
that you know gets people thinking a

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,560
little differently here this is not

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,930
linux but what bsd is we are a branch of

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,049
UNIX to ride from the original 18t UNIX

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,390
back in the late 70s so that's where our

00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,280
roots come from what makes it a little

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,320
different than Linux is that we're a

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,119
complete operating system as opposed to

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,820
just a colonel with packages when you

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,899
install FreeBSD or any of the BSD s such

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,240
as open or net or dragonfly you have

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,040
your kernel plus your user land included

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,710
it's not just a colonel with a bunch of

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,719
packages for your binutils etc all that

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,079
stuff's built into the operating system

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,790
so you can load freebsd on a box have no

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,229
packages installed whatsoever and still

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,629
have a fully functional system you can

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,000
ssh into and do all the all the server

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,530
type stuff before you even load any

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,819
packages

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,650
released under a different style

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,970
licensed than Linux I know this is

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,740
something some people know about others

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,470
don't I'm going to touch on this briefly

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,000
here so why don't we go ahead and swerve

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,260
into this one first and just get it out

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
of the way because this seems to be a

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,050
big difference between bsd and lenox and

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,100
some people are okay with it some are

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,170
first thing I want to point out is this

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,540
is the freebsd license in case you have

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,920
not seen it recently and in here lies

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,440
kind of the division between the

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,520
communities the freebsd license is very

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,310
simple you're looking at the whole thing

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,019
right here it's two clauses basically

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,540
which just say please include our

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,910
copyright in it and then please don't

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,350
sue us if something goes wrong that's

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,860
pretty much all it is to stay compliant

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,140
with the bsd license by comparison the

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,300
GPL has tended to grow over the years

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:07,739
this is a copy of the GPL 3 and it's

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,090
just a tad bit longer okay so you know

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,440
why do I show this to you this is just

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,810
to make a point in the difference in

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,819
philosophy between the two communities

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,830
the bsd community of which pc-bsd is a

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,320
part of we release all our source and

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,299
code and binaries under the freebsd

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,680
license which basically says you do

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,209
whatever you want with it we put no

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,620
restrictions on you whatsoever we don't

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,480
want you to have to deal with lawyers I

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,190
have to worry about being compliance

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,650
it's yours have fun just include our

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,940
copyright if you use it that's it you

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,200
know you're not going to get sued later

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,090
because you didn't comply with the

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,940
freebsd license most likely it's pretty

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,370
hard to break the GPL on the other hand

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,560
it imposes restrictions you have to do

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,269
certain things to stay in compliance and

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,650
I know this is kind of a sticky thing if

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,570
some of you guys are big Linux fans

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,220
that's a some people say that is

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,370
advantage it's keeping it free it's in

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,870
the open freebsd bsd yes you could close

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,910
source it and companies have done that

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,290
we view that as a strength that gets

00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,940
more of our software out there in the

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,950
open people are using it even if you

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,000
don't know it I mean when you turn on a

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,070
device you don't know if it's running

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,750
bsd under the hood it may be but we're

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,910
getting our stuff out in the public and

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,959
being used no matter what form and ends

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,700
up taking we're not going to put

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,600
restrictions on what you do with it and

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,760
we don't want it that's not our goal so

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,049
that's you know that's the big one of

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,640
the biggest differences between the two

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,750
and philosophy anyway I mean there's a

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,310
whole bunch of other things as far as

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,960
how system development is done how the

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,590
community is organized but we're not

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,940
doing a talk just on freebie

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,910
today we're going to go into some other

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,650
stuff as well but we're basically

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,740
FreeBSD came from is it's still

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,660
descendant of the original bsd unix it's

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,070
a complete operating system as i said

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,919
running all your third-party

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,870
applications via ports packages what

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,229
it's used most often for is for hosting

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,970
servers apache file servers freeing as

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,070
if any of you went to the talk based on

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,840
freebsd you're seeing in a lot of

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,910
embedded devices places where you

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,740
wouldn't expect you find out Oh Yahoo's

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,139
running freebsd or own asses running

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,040
freebsd you know it's in those type of

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:05,620
environments whether you know it or not

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,180
it's also able to build and run most of

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,919
the same stuff you see under Linux there

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,450
aren't open source POSIX operating

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,660
systems so you're going to see a patchy

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,180
you'll see x que de firefox OpenOffice

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,280
libre office I mean you name it probably

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,900
any open source package out there has

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,280
already been ported to freebsd at some

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,620
point because i think the porks tree is

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,510
like 25,000 packages in it right now i

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,630
mean there's a lot of stuff that just

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,729
runs on freebsd some things it does

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,550
different we have some native features

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:36,789
such as ZFS from the solaris guys that's

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,950
in freebsd some stuff called jelly which

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:41,080
is for your g amin shin layers so

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,090
you can encrypt file systems in crib ZFS

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,039
etc those are some things just built

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,660
right into freebsd and a nerve thing

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,150
most people don't realize is we run

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,190
Linux in other words we can run Linux

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,650
binaries in freebsd without emulation

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,660
it's just a compatibility layer which

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,860
runs linux apps that normally just full

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,360
speed i mean you don't notice the

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,310
difference in some cases we've been told

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,930
it's faster on freebsd because our

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,270
Colonel may be optimized in a different

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,710
way than on the Linux kernel so just you

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,270
know your mileage may vary depends on

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,599
what you're doing but that is something

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,039
we can do so now that we have kind of

00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,560
idea what FreeBSD is well how does

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,650
pc-bsd relate to this well first of all

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,510
it's a desktop version of freebsd it's

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,880
not a fork that's one common

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,370
misconception we hear is oh you're based

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,530
off of freebsd you know when you started

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,510
five years ago whatever well no we're

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,860
still based off of freebsd we're one

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,110
hundred percent compatible we're not a

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,539
fork we are not taking their code and

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,430
changing it when you install pc-bsd you

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,620
are installing freebsd essentially on

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,620
your system so just to clear up any

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,870
confusion there

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,639
% compatible and yes we come up with

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,960
changes to freebsd but we submit them

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,910
back and get them in the freebie istry

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,370
usually pretty quickly so it's not like

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,720
we're forking off there it just

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,910
basically comes with your pre-built

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,490
desktop packages so in the case of

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,340
pc-bsd 82 and previous releases we'll

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,780
have X and Katie pre-installed loaded

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,580
just ready to go out of the box so the

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,380
moment you boot up you get what looks

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,690
like just any other in a linux distro

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,310
sooo sore red hat or what other ones are

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,870
using KDE nowadays or have that option

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,630
that's what it will look like at first

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,400
glance most people mistake it for that

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,840
it's an it's initialized for the desktop

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,490
environment so we also include some

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,530
things such as flash and the binary

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,610
nvidia drivers we have support for those

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,560
on freebsd both in the 32-bit and 64-bit

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,139
varieties and we ship those with the

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,949
package or with the operating system

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,389
just to make it easier for end-users so

00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,340
what do we do different than pitla and

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,190
freebsd we have some own custom

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,020
utilities here as well freebsd currently

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,210
there are installer if anyone has

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,010
installed freebsd in the last couple of

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,110
years you remember it's the text-based

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,520
installation it's your console kind of

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,930
like what the freenas installer looked

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,910
like if you're in that talk it's just a

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,289
couple texts things but it doesn't

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,810
support some of the cool new features

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,120
that freebsd does such as ZFS mirroring

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,520
jelling labeling your file systems etc

00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,720
they are working on adding those but we

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,510
beat them to the punch and we already

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,940
have that in arm star so PC BSC can take

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,289
advantage of all those features another

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,840
cool thing we did is we added the

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:11,720
ability to install freebsd or pc-bsd

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,520
from our installation medium we figured

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,349
oh since we have all these cool features

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,720
that freebsd doesn't have you know the

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,699
built-in support for further installer

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,370
why don't we just give a checkbox that

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,370
says load freebsd or load pc-bsd and you

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,410
can take advantage of the same features

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,870
supports installing from DVD USB network

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:34,159
live I mean it's pretty standard as far

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,140
as that stuff goes this is what you'll

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,120
be presented with when you boot pc-bsd

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,130
as opposed to a text-based menu you'll

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,510
come up to a nicely you know a nice

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,680
little gooey hero it makes it very

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,850
simple to get your operating system

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,450
installed here would be an example of

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,829
our disk partition page so in this case

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,350
pretty standard you got your file system

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:56,270
options so ZF

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,700
ufs is the default on FreeBSD but in

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,060
this example we're doing ZFS for a beer

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,470
system use the entire disk freebsd does

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,010
some different naming for their devices

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:10,760
here so dev ad0 be your ID device sorel

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,620
88 excuse me we have options for

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,710
encrypting user data it's real we try to

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,330
keep everything simple in pc-bsd so you

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,070
know jelly encryption for example

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,170
freebsd if you look up a how-to on how

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,790
to do that you may get a wiki page with

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,190
12 commands you got to do all this this

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,140
and this set up we just simplify it one

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,910
checkbox enable don't enable and then it

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,820
does all the magic in the background for

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:36,290
you yeah it boot it boots it

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,610
automatically when you boot up the DVD

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:42,110
it just brings up the GUI so oh you put

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,270
into command line well yeah show me that

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,270
afterwards I'd be curious to see it but

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,700
oh yeah sorry about that yeah he was

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,520
asking how do you boot into the GUI from

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,839
the DVD and it should automatically just

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,760
boot into it but if it dumps you do a

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,709
command prompt usually one of two things

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,029
has happened somehow xorg failed to

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,000
start and it will dump you back to a

00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:03,860
command prompt to see what's going on or

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,370
on and off to take a look and see that's

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,770
usually the case so anyway so that's our

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,240
disc set up we support GPT as well it's

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,740
another feature I've neglected to

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,900
mention so if you're dealing with a

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,130
large disc two terabytes or greater in

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:22,010
size we can do GPT installations on that

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:24,380
and another feature we have added to it

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,390
to make pc-bsd more usable as we have

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,750
network management go he's FreeBSD your

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,370
network management GUI is VI VI the wpa

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,110
supplicant file if you've never done

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,110
that before it boy are you in for a

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,459
treat there's a lot of fun we didn't

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,320
want to go through all that hassle so we

00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,970
wrote our own custom gooeys which just

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,959
allow you to set up your wired wireless

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,330
networking support for ipv4 v6 some cool

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,430
features like lag failover so if you're

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,410
on a laptop you can unplug your wired

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,240
connection and keep surfing and not lose

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,290
your downloads and you know keep on

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,610
doing what you're doing it will

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,720
automatically fail over the wireless

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,940
device this would be an example what

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,430
this looks like in pc-bsd just a network

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,150
manager our network devices will be

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,770
named

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,790
based on the type of driver they are so

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:12,920
II m0 a th 0 etc varies depending on

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,540
your hardware but it'll detect them and

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,600
then provide you with some options to

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,520
set them up in this case here we're

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,160
looking at we're setting up our DNS

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:27,320
hostname ipv6 if we're going to use it

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,240
etc another thing we've added to pc-bsd

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,860
is a system management utility which

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,020
comes in useful for a variety of ways

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,910
especially for developers first of all

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,710
is an easy way to get the FreeBSD

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,840
sources if you're not familiar with CVS

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,100
or svn or how to do that or which mirror

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,870
to get it from because there's a ton of

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,450
them we can go ahead and do the check

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,790
out for you we have port snap support

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,280
which in freebsd land we have the porch

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,020
tree you have rpms and other files on

00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,570
linux well we have ports and packages

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,460
and this can allow you to grab the

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,010
freebsd porks tree and do that kind of

00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,840
work and a little feature i put in there

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,060
for fun as tech support sheets so when

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,430
we get x users saying hey my card X

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,690
doesn't work send me a support sheet I

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,570
can view all the sensitive information

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,550
and find out what's really going on and

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,500
this is what the school would look like

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,910
for example there's a much different

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,070
tabs your for different options but i

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,780
just want to show you one here checking

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,130
out the system sources the source is

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,570
broken up into a bunch different things

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,150
you'll have your system for the colonel

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,690
your bin etc and you can choose what you

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:29,120
want there another way in which pc-bsd

00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,130
is greatly different from freebsd is we

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,870
also have our own packaging system now

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,150
this is this is a topic we're going to

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,580
spend some time on here a little bit but

00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,500
we've inventor I've invented a package

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,110
system called pbi which is push button

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,700
installer some of you may have heard of

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,030
my story of why I decided to write this

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,230
but back in the day when I was starting

00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,150
pc-bsd I was running a lot of links

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,400
distros I was back on Mandrake and

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,800
lindos and red hat and you know a

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,910
variety of them and it seemed like you

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
know especially I throw it on my wife's

00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,510
system etc it seemed like my weekends

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,330
bit ended up being eaten up by

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,220
installing updates well I'd go update X

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,020
app and now it has to update 20 other

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,480
apps which oh those need an update to

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,550
and if I'm really lucky nothing will

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,260
break and I can keep working and more

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,940
often than not it seemed like I ended up

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,410
having breakage or something would

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,670
change the desktop doesn't work properly

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,680
now some other apps affected that

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,300
it shouldn't have been but it was you

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,430
know I understand that's just how it

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,450
works but and that has gotten better

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,390
over the years but i just wanted to

00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,040
avoid that whole mess so i just decided

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,960
to write something different similar to

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,610
how Mac os10 does their packages how

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,620
Windows does it where everything's

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,560
self-contained we're not installing

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,690
files all over the directories all over

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,920
the operating system just everywhere

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,990
where they can manipulate and touch

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,690
other files potentially and break things

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,090
so everything self-contained this

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,000
introduces a layer keeping the operating

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,310
system separate from the applications so

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,200
if you're on Linux or even freebsd using

00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:58,650
ports and packages and say you set up a

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,860
desktop with KDE while KD requires like

00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,510
2.8 million dependencies i think now and

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,280
that is your entire operating system in

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,660
desktop and if you want to make a change

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,490
to one of those who knows how many other

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,990
ones you're going to manipulate we

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,990
wanted to have that separate you install

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,810
pc-bsd and then you go grab firefox or

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,000
LibreOffice whatever those install and

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,340
they don't touch any of your KDE stuff

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,510
it'll mess with them there's no risk of

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,880
potentially breaking them when you

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,890
remove them if you install firefox and

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,720
install k office they don't intermingle

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,450
at all don't touch each other that was a

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,300
goal I wanted just to avoid that the

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,800
potential for breakage the way the way I

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,390
can best phrase it is it's kind of like

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,260
a spider web if you pull one piece you

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,760
don't know how many other ones you're

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,260
going to pull well in this one you pull

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,880
the one piece out it's not connected

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,660
anything else it's not touching anything

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,700
and this was to provide stability for my

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,410
wife or your mom or just anybody who's

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,060
not computer savvy just you don't want

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,110
to have to fix that form you just want

00:14:51,060 --> 00:15:00,000
them to be able to get on the computer

00:14:52,110 --> 00:15:01,320
and use it yeah it is so the question

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,730
was does that mean the pbis are

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,410
statically linked and self-contained

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,390
they are self-contained but they're not

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,280
usually statically length or dynamically

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,470
linked including the libraries within

00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,970
them I'll talk about why we do that a

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,450
little bit later and how we use that for

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,460
some optimization but I guess they do

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,590
include all the libraries so the pbi

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,690
will end up being larger than say an RPM

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,790
file because it has all the libs built

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,380
into a but if you took a fresh system

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,030
installed that same rpm you'd end up

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,940
sucking in all those libraries anyway so

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,520
the size will come out the same in that

00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,720
respect

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,660
we'll talk about how that works in a

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,830
minute and how we've updated that and I

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,330
kind of mentioned this already it's just

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,860
based on the philosophy that's a little

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,480
different that applications are not your

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,610
operating system your operating system

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,900
is your operating system Firefox should

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,450
not be screwing with your operating

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,980
system I mean the last thing I want to

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,750
do is install a new web browser and then

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,160
waste my day and my weekend trying to

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,240
figure out why something else changed or

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,470
broke that's just something i'm not into

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,280
everything self-contained doesn't change

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,990
your system packages and just a visual

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,820
representation of this so we'll just

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,410
assume for a second here this is linux

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,200
this could be freebsd doesn't really

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,670
matter in this case but there's your

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
traditional open-source packaging model

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,030
everything is dependent on everything

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,730
else and the tree can get very big and

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:18,670
tangled very quickly this is your pc-bsd

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,980
model based system which is freebsd in

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,530
this case desktop which katie or

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,780
whatever and then your applications only

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,130
relying on the base system so we do rely

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,440
on something which is just a major

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,750
version of freebsd whatever that is so

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,490
eight or nine or whatnot but then the

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:37,090
apps don't touch one another their self

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,580
contained so some current information

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:43,300
about PC DSC right now we're at version

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:46,840
82 we track the FreeBSD releases so if

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:50,170
pc-bsd 82 will be based on FreeBSD 82

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,690
and nine will be based on line etc 82

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,030
includes KDE 4 55 as the default desktop

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,950
this was released about five six months

00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:01,420
ago now so that was what we had at the

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,160
time and had working well however we're

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,839
going to be making some changes to 9 and

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,339
this is what some of you have used PCBs

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,410
you probably don't want to hear first

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,550
thing we've done first major change is

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,630
we are no longer KDE centric we have had

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,940
probably the biggest hindrance to

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,370
adoption of pc-bsd has been oh I love

00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,220
the OS I like the idea I like free BSC

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,690
gosh I hate que te you know can you put

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,160
something else on it and of course

00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,630
everyone has a different opinion of what

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,310
that something else would be so it's not

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,050
as simple as just switching us to gnome

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,850
expecting everyone to be happy because

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,500
then you get the same crowd on the other

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,200
side going oh just hatin home I can't

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,740
use it whatever it is so we decided to

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,510
go to a window manager agnostic model so

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,830
we will be offering multiple window

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,260
managers and I'll show you a little bit

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,510
of that here in a second

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,400
but this required us redoing all of our

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,620
utilities decoupling them all from Katie

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,320
they are all written in pure acute and

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,700
then re implementing our pbi system

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,500
because that was written in cute and

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,000
Katie as well so we had to go back to

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,770
the drawing board and just D couple

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,810
everything and make it agnostic so

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,720
whatever your particular window manager

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,850
is and that's pretty much what I

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,190
mentioned here how this works though

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,260
during the installation the installer is

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,000
now going to offer window manager meta

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,890
packages is what we've termed them and

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,810
that's just basically a way of saying I

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,550
want to install gnome and it that list

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:21,480
will have all the various packages that

00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:23,490
make up gnome or KDE or xfce or you know

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,440
lxde etc there's going to be a variety

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,480
of them and then the cool thing with

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,940
this is is post installation you can

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,620
then add and remove these again through

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,830
the system manager so say you get your

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,540
system loaded up you put KDE 4 on it you

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,860
give it a go for a week and go wow this

00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,840
really isn't for me that was a bad

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,240
choice you can just go into the system

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,920
manager and say deleted add whatever

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,040
else I want to try something else and

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,260
it'll just do it for you so currently

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,080
what we're looking at targeting offering

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,820
49 will be Katie youth 4-series gnome 2

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,650
i'm hearing that gnome 3 probably won't

00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,760
be ported over till after nine point 0

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,680
for freebsd xfce and then LXDE those are

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,780
going to be our four main ones that we

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,580
call the supported window managers and

00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,600
what I mean by that is those are where

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,190
we're going to be spending the time

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,140
optimizing them make sure all the

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,900
settings work and you know just things

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,430
work as expected at a box however we are

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
going to offer a variety of unsupported

00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,120
window managers which are a lot more

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,680
bare-bones ones that you know only the

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,300
brave at heart usually run or people

00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,220
really know what they're doing so

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,780
that'll be your awesomes Enlightenment's

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,940
you know window maker fluxbox and yeah

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,840
so if there's any other smaller ones out

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,280
there i'm sure there's you know a

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:38,130
zillion of them that I'm messing right

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:39,810
give one open box I haven't added it but

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,830
it's in the tree I could add it those

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,210
are the kind of things I was going to

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,770
mention if there are other window

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,900
managers you would like to see this run

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,220
drop me an email usually takes me 20

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,230
minutes to put it in and it's just there

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,580
again it won't be supported we're not

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,080
going to officially go out of our way to

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,760
make everything work but it'll be there

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,860
so you can run it and you know go about

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,870
your business into your thing with it

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,240
and this is what it'll look like now in

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,370
the Installer so in this case we've

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,780
finished all the disc set up and now

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,610
we're going to pick our system packages

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,110
so you have some different categories or

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,490
based development tools which are like

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,290
your svn tools get etc and then gnome to

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,030
katie for there's a bunch more down at

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,620
the bottom and you just pick which ones

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,320
you want and it customizes the system

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,340
for you and throws it on the disk in the

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,809
hardware drivers as well that's where

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,179
you can pick like your nvidia binary

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:29,110
driver if you're running nvidia etc or

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:31,360
HP for printers and whatnot and post

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,460
installation in our system tool you get

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,020
the exact same menu so anything you did

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,940
there you're not locked into permanently

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,160
you decide all on a bail on this one or

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,480
I had this one just a checkbox you click

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,980
it it does it it'll pull it from the

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,200
mirrors or it'll ask you to insert the

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:48,760
DVD and just pull it off the packages

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,290
they're so pretty simple a big thing

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,429
we've done is improved our control panel

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,559
one of the things we had to do and

00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:55,600
decoupling from KDE was we were using

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:58,330
KDE system settings utility before which

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,700
is their control panel and obviously if

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,830
Katie's not installed we can't rely on

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,210
that so we wrote our own control panel

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,340
which is agnostic to the particular

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,900
window manager it's going to be

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,610
consistent it looks the same between

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,500
window managers so we can document it

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,360
and say here's where your sound settings

00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,530
always are regardless your window

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,080
manager here's where your network

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,490
settings always are cetera and we have

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,780
some cool things where it can detect the

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,570
running window manager and show

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,520
appropriate icons for that too so say

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,590
you're running I think I have a picture

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,640
of it here you're running lxde I don't

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,370
know if you can see it up in the corner

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,960
here but the lxde icon is automatically

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,120
selected and then it brings up some

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:39,010
special things for the lxd keyboard

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:42,610
config etc yeah gnome 3 will fry not be

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:44,650
until nine dot 19 the question by the

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,410
way was it which what about gnome 3 but

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,580
ya know 3 is still being ported but

00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,320
because of some of the new things that

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,850
rely on Linux specifically that we have

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,590
to wait and it poured it into freebsd

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,530
I'm hearing probably not till nine one

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,120
because it changed significantly so

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,130
we're going to ship with gnome 2 by

00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,720
default and then when 91 comes out six

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,960
months later gnome 3 you'll probably be

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,960
in that

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,660
well FreeBSD has the question was what

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,460
how do we do linux packages how do you

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,380
run those natively well Linux

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,120
compatibility is installed by default on

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,070
pc-bsd and that's actually how we do

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,140
some things like the flash plugin Adobe

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,910
only releases the Linux binaries they

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,220
don't release bsd natives at this point

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,770
so we use NS plugin wrapper and then

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,330
wrap the the linux binary so the linux

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,980
compatibility is there if you can

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,690
download a command line app and just run

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,130
it it may just run otherwise the

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,170
utilities are there where you can do the

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,090
RPM commands and install it and it goes

00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,040
into a special compat Linux directory

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:51,910
and then you have your regular Linux

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:53,740
tree there correct the Linux yeah the

00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,510
Linux stuffs in its own directory not to

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,480
touch the rest of your working system so

00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,920
the worst you could break your Flash you

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,330
know but you couldn't break necessarily

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,680
your desktop or window manager and

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,900
whatnot so this is also just so you can

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,160
see here we had the option so if you're

00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,420
going to switch window managers you can

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,430
peek at what other icons we have

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:16,870
available for those window managers and

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:18,460
switch to them so one of the things I

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,230
mentioned we had to re-implement was the

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,300
pbi system because of it being written

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,160
in QT and Katie for it just was not

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,230
going to work on 9 without Katie

00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,780
installed and you know no one puts

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,950
things in different places and etc so we

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,200
had to go back to the drawing board on

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,460
this one so we tried to address several

00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,500
things while we're here if we're going

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,570
to redo it let's redo it right so the

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,910
first thing we did is it was attacked on

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,350
CL I interface before it was all cutie

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,690
base so that you know the command line

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,010
stuff was kind of clergy so I decided

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,440
well that's got to be fixed we're going

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,120
to go full command line with this

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,520
another thing was the PB eyes were not

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,290
sharing libraries in this other system

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,510
so if you downloaded firefox and

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,070
thunderbird they had their own separate

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,420
libraries they didn't share them which

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,880
was a waste of disk space and ram

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,100
runtime space as well so i wanted to

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,440
find a way to fix that we didn't have a

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,820
big distribution infrastructure we just

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,260
had a website or you could go download

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,120
things but it wasn't really integrated

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,280
as well as it could be digital

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,900
signatures and something a lot of people

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,430
mentioned in other countries especially

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,740
where the internet speeds aren't that

00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,480
good was the file updates are pretty

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,030
large you know

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,200
pbi may be a lot bigger than your rpm I

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,110
don't want to download this whole

00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,790
package just to get a small update so

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,590
how did we solve these well the first

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,809
thing everything in pbi now is

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,400
implemented in shell I mean it's very

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,350
simple so everything is available via

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,490
the command line and there's a variety

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,200
commands there's like 15 different

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:40,320
commands you can run to access all the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,080
aspects of the pbi system so pbi browser

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,679
repo add etc and I'll talk a little bit

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,020
about what those do here in a minute but

00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,520
the biggest thing was the library

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,350
sharing since we didn't want to be

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,419
wasting disk space and ram space anymore

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:57,299
I had to figure out a way how do we

00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:59,400
share these and I forget who suggested

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,049
it but at one point it came up well why

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,549
aren't we using hard links to some kind

00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,549
of advantage here to make this all work

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:07,830
so I came up with a system that uses

00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:09,780
something we called the hash tour where

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,299
we keep track of hard links and keep

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,850
track of checksums so we know which

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,669
libraries are identical so you can

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,980
install a version that uses X version of

00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:21,570
gtk and then another version of gtk

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,040
side-by-side and they don't overwrite or

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,830
clobber one another they can coexist

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,330
peacefully and then you can still share

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,450
those libraries with other apps that use

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,070
the identical library and this reduces

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,960
our disk and runtime memory usage

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,240
because it's all hard linked it looks at

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,620
it in freebsd by RI node and says oh i

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,000
have that librarian memory now i don't

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,679
need to load into a copy of it even

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,320
though it's in a physical different

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,360
location on the disk or it looks like it

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,730
is and then we track matches with

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,110
sha-256 checksums and we have a daemon

00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,910
that i wrote that monitors and manages

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,040
that just make sure everything is in a

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:57,059
same format where it should be and not

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,290
being messed with etc and here's here's

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,020
kind of how this works just a visual

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,520
representation this may help so say we

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,960
have to PB eyes here it could be

00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,640
anything will say firefox and

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,190
thunderbird and we go ahead and install

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,530
and we notice they have two libraries

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,390
lib foo and the check sums on them are

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,280
identical this will all be predetermined

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,600
you build a ppi it calculates those

00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,120
checksum so we'll know what they are

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,799
ahead of time so the daemon is going to

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,809
run through and go okay here's a library

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,400
let's put this in the hash door and it

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,080
puts it in there with the checksum

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,419
appended to the end of the file name so

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,280
we can keep track of what it is it then

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,049
gets to the second pbi and says oh hey

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,400
cool this library is in the hash sure

00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,500
already with the right checksum we

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,540
have a match we can remove the original

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,370
library from the pbi and it's hard link

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,550
it in there and we can monitor the hard

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:43,260
line count now suppose later we've

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,310
updated Thunder burden it has a

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,750
different checks on now it just gets

00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,150
another copy of the library and the

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,590
Hastur with its own hash and we can hard

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,680
link to that with newer versions of the

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:55,500
pbi that use that new your library so

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,360
say you delete Firefox now and now that

00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,430
old libraries orphaned and then the hash

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,650
count or the hardly count would drop to

00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,420
one in this case the daemon will go oh

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,150
we have an orphan library here we don't

00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,060
need this anymore it's time to remove it

00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,680
and we have eliminated that library but

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,270
it can be readded later if you go and

00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,830
add an older application and that needs

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,330
that library it'll just throw it right

00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,930
back in for you and you keep on going

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,860
your way any questions on that real

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:38,400
quick so that's usually where i get a

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:40,170
lot of questions yeah correct it's i

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,330
wrote it so that it runs on native

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,060
freebsd as well so it is in the freebsd

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,350
port stream people were using it there

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,000
potentially it could be used on linux or

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,680
elsewhere i mean if somebody wants to

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,330
port it over it does rely on a couple

00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,550
bsd commands and whatnot but i'm sure

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,630
porting wouldn't be that difficult

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:57,240
they're looking at using it for the new

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,350
freenas system for freeing as 81 and

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,350
that'll be the format they use for

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,880
plugging in extensions into freenas but

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,740
yeah it is pretty horrible I mean it's

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,230
just a shell big shell script that does

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,260
everything it's it's pretty simple so

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,970
yeah it could be definitely portable

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,000
know one thing I didn't mention too was

00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,590
because everything is self-contained now

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,880
you can actually install apps as a user

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,610
you don't need to give people root

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,470
access so we have the group directory if

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,630
you're familiar with how OSX does their

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,970
applications it's group writable for

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,650
operators and so if you add a user then

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,510
give them operators for mission they can

00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,310
install apps without having to go and

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,290
get the root password from you so you

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,390
could potentially install a desktop give

00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,680
it to mom and say here you go have fun

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,600
don't even tell her the root password

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,400
and she can still get on add her

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,620
applications do whatever she needs to

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,730
without getting into damaging areas of

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,220
the system that you would need

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,210
for in that case so there's some cool

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,650
things you can do like that and

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,110
everything somebody brought up that I

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,480
even thought about was oh I can NFS

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,280
export this entire pbi directory to 20

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,290
machines and they can all run the apps

00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,030
right off of this this directory here

00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,679
they're self-contained they're all

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,900
running the same version of pc-bsd why

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,429
not yeah sure you can so I mean it does

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,750
open up some intriguing possibilities

00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:09,210
you can you can mess with this in a

00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,980
couple different ways but i'll go ahead

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,830
and move on now to how we did the

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,360
distribution fixes well first of all we

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,620
wanted when I wrote this I wanted to

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,860
create a way where it's easy to

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,809
distribute ppi's to the end users on 82

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,490
in the previous we've had a website

00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:25,049
called pbi juror which is just a nice

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,880
web front-end and you can go and

00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:28,830
download browse and get your apps and

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,970
install them but I wanted something a

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,650
little better I wanted something that

00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,140
was integrated with digital signatures

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,809
so we have done that now where it

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,000
digitally signs all the PBIS and we are

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:41,700
now setting up a repository system and

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,830
by repository what I mean is you create

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,840
a repo file you embed your public

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,700
signature key into it and then your

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,230
build server signs all the PBIS it

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,169
builds with that key so we know which

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:54,960
repository it matches up with and then

00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:56,490
we can add a repo to a system and I have

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,169
a GUI that does this to I'll show you

00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,910
that in a minute once you've added the

00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:01,500
repos from the system you can browse all

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,290
those repositories and say cool I want

00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,299
to grab Firefox from Joe's repository or

00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,820
the official pc-bsd repository or

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:11,520
whoever it is or free has will have a

00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,960
repository for their PBIS and the pbi

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,370
add command just knows where to look

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,750
where to grab it has a list of the

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,419
mirrors for that repo and it just does

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,250
it so it's just really easy to integrate

00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,750
this with other systems especially like

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,340
free nas and whatnot where they can run

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,690
their own repo without having to

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,290
reinvent that we all the works been done

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,870
form we have meta files that contain all

00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,880
the information I master index of all

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,710
the PBIS that just says here's the list

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,450
of what's on the repo and then the meta

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,040
files will have information like what

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,220
license is it under what's the

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,870
description keywords name we have some

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,610
translations support in there so if you

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:47,070
want to translate Firefox's description

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,480
in a japanese we can do that so if

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,360
you're browsing it in japanese you'll

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,429
get appropriate description so it's it's

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,780
pretty cool it's definitely fixes a

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,780
problem we had in previous versions

00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,010
and as I mentioned going hand-in-hand

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,930
with the reposes digital signatures

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,940
we're using openssl illness which is in

00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,520
the base of freebsd so we maintain that

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,720
freebsd compatibility during the

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,390
creation we're going to go ahead and

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,580
sign the archive and any script some

00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,980
ppi's use installation scripts so a good

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,930
example would be virtual box it's a

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,610
little more tricky than just Firefox it

00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,880
has to load some kernel modules and put

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,230
some things into to run when it boots up

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,730
so we can do some of the networking so

00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,960
it'll have a script to get signed as

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,240
well so we can verify nothing has been

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,640
tampered with from the time it was built

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,380
to the time you got it and all those

00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,390
things can be verified on your end user

00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,590
system when you run the pbi add command

00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,990
it'll check it make sure it's good and

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:43,670
you know fail if not and same thing with

00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:46,220
the GUI as well and the last thing I had

00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:48,410
mentioned was binary patching or the

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,240
problem of downloading a big pbi over a

00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,770
slow through world internet connection

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,350
you know it really stinks if it's a 50

00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,360
meg file yeah it's going to take 10

00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,530
hours for me to get so we had to come up

00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,570
with a way of making it quicker to

00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,280
download updates especially since all

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,990
the files are contained within them a

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,490
lot of times most the files aren't

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,020
changing it's just a couple ones from

00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,720
the new firefox version a couple new

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,970
firefox libraries at binary etc the rest

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,590
of the files are identical so I came up

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,990
with the system that allows us to build

00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:18,050
binary patches when you're building PBIS

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,730
and in this case sometimes it's

00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,710
ninety-five percent reduction in the

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,630
file size so you'll have a small binary

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,870
diff file it says I'm going from Firefox

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,550
four-point-oh to 4.01 and it's only 5%

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,290
of the original size because only a few

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:33,740
files have changed and it knows which

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:35,660
ones and it uses the BS diff and bs

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,920
patch commands these are free BST on

00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,480
previously I don't know what the

00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,530
availability is on Linux so this would

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
be some of the stuff that would have to

00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,730
be ported and it uses those for

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,730
generating and then patching binaries

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:49,520
and libraries etc it auto generates the

00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,890
patch files from ports so the pbi system

00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,750
tracks the freebsd ports tree which is

00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,400
where all the real work happens as far

00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,470
as the new firefox hitting the tree or a

00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,850
new thunderbird or whatnot so when we

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,620
see there's an update to the firefox

00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,750
port it builds a new pbi and auto

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,850
generates the patches for X number of

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,200
versions in the past so even if you

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,670
messed a couple of updates you can still

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,530
jump up to the latest with the binary

00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,780
diff

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,120
and then auto fall back to full patching

00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,740
so if you have a corrupted Firefox pbi

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,060
or you've monkeyed with the files and

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,130
the checksums don't match it'll just

00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:23,260
fall back to the full file if it needs

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:24,550
to is a backup so that's all great and

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,230
that's happening in the background but

00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,730
if you're just an average user and don't

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,410
really care about the command line you

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,510
know what do I do how does this help me

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,670
so we've written a new tool called the

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,430
app cafe that's our new software

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,750
management utility it's cute for based

00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,210
front end and it's a front end of the

00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,620
pbi browser command which is command

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,600
line so everything you see in these

00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,460
gooeys you can do it the command prompt

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,770
that ever firing up X even you can run

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,390
this on system without X it allows

00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,250
installing the applications as your user

00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,630
account and it's smart enough to know

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,550
when certain apps need root we've

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,960
flagged it in the repository as this is

00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,090
a root app so you'll need root

00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,030
permissions to support for browsing

00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,410
managing repos arranging and adding new

00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,560
mirrors so if you're going to run your

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,820
own local pc-bsd pbi mirror you can just

00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,610
set it up to point to that and it'll

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,350
default as that is the first one we have

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,790
a tray icon that's integrated with it

00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,530
that'll just you know more on you hey

00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,149
there's an update please install the

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,500
update and you get a chance and all

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:20,230
those little niceties the end users

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,880
expect and this is what it would look

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,590
like or looked like a couple months ago

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,450
we've been updating a little bit since

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,820
then but in this case it's just a

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,530
browser and we have our categories we

00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,970
have some of the latest releases so you

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:36,070
can kind of promo those up up at the top

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,929
when you get to a category browse

00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,610
through it and find Firefox it gives us

00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,470
some information about it in this case

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,330
it's already installed we can do

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:45,100
automatic updating on it so if you check

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,570
that the daemon will actually monitor

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,850
for updates and do the update in the

00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,159
background for you you know tells you

00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,830
the author is with the license is what

00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,570
platform version etc and then a

00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,580
description which will be localized

00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,350
based on your language now a neat thing

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,740
I didn't mention about the platform is

00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:05,290
on amd64 we can run 32-bit stuff right

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,700
but with pbi since all the libraries are

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,950
built-in now you can just download a

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,410
32-bit app and run it without touching

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,530
anything else so wine is not available

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:16,420
on 64-bit natively we just say that's

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,460
great install the 32 bit wine and it

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,690
just goes yeah we don't have to do

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,040
anything else it just goes in its own

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,500
directory and all its libraries are

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,600
there it

00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,770
happy it runs so we have some neat

00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,960
little things we can do like that with

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,700
apps that are not available and 64 like

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,890
the the cut you know super nintendo

00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,690
emulators genesis emulators those type

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:36,590
of things that only compile on 32-bit

00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,940
for us so after you've installed it you

00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,160
know you can go into the installed tab

00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,870
here and view what's there and bring up

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,330
the some options you know go back to the

00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,130
details page or install desktop icons if

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,610
you deleted it just want to get it back

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:51,140
or reinstall my menu icons install them

00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,640
for all users which will prompt you for

00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,650
your root password and then we'll load

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,570
it in the menu for all the users on the

00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,060
system put it in the system directory

00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,130
and then of course uninstall so I mean

00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,510
that's it's as basic as can be and

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:06,050
that's by design we're trying to keep it

00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:08,180
simple another new feature we've added

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:11,180
in 29 is something we call the life

00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,700
preserver it basically allows you just

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,710
to back up this is real simple backup

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,050
tool which and you can see we're pushing

00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,630
freenas just a tad bit here you know we

00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,890
love our cousin's over there but anyway

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,080
it allows you to backup all your home

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,460
data all your user data to a remote

00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,910
server such as free knives or anything

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,620
running our sink and ssh so even a Linux

00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,020
box anything that has those two pieces

00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,450
there you can back up to it's just an

00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,340
easy to use tray application you just

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,140
set it up with a hostname username and

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,490
it does all the key negotiation for you

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,620
and sets it up so it's ready to do

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,960
automatic backups and then you say how

00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,000
often daily or weekly or don't back up

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,800
i'll do it when I want and then it just

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,200
goes ahead and fires it up using our

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,750
sink over ssh so you get encryption from

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,340
n ed and it does all the incremental

00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,960
backups etc that's why we're using our

00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,390
sinks so once you do your initial backup

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,200
the extra backups after that are pretty

00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:04,490
quick usually and this is what this

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,500
application looks like I've already

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,140
added a backup server so i have a

00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,400
freebsd system at my house i haven't

00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,680
done any backup so the you know it's not

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,510
scheduled etc you just click start it

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,510
just goes icon tells you what it's done

00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:19,460
it's just really point and click and try

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,960
to make it as simple as possible and the

00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,810
same thing with restore school thing is

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,160
i have my laptop i'm constantly changing

00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,900
so i'm developing all right so I'm

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,510
blowing it away and loading you stuff

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,310
and trying new kernels etc so I can load

00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,990
a fresh system just hit the rsync server

00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,810
and say yeah we're storing my data okay

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,310
come back 20 minutes later

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,750
everything's back where it was I'm happy

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:43,480
so very simple so when is all this new

00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,190
exciting goodies coming well pc-bsd

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,500
nine-point-oh is based on FreeBSD

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,420
nine-point-oh so we're kind of tied to

00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,610
their release schedule at this point

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,680
it's looking like late summer or you

00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,230
know possibly early fall there dot o

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,520
releases tend to get pushed back you

00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,230
know as we get closer and closer and

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,330
people panic and go oh no I need to get

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,530
this feature in so you know that's

00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,950
that's the best guess i can give you

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:08,170
maybe september-october etc and we're

00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,360
already rolling snapshots of this though

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,880
so if you want to test this out we just

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,550
did a big snapshot for world ipv6 day

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,100
which was an ipv6 only version of pc-bsd

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,050
there's no ipv4 in it so we ruled that

00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,210
out people are using this to test their

00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,040
ipv6 connectivity at home or at work or

00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,480
whatnot so all those things are already

00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,670
up on our website you can get the pre

00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,320
releases and just try it out if you do

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,150
please just give me some feedback if you

00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,680
find bugs etc this is still alpha

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,210
quality and we're trying to polish it

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,110
and just get it all knocked out before

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:43,710
we close to beta so that's all I have

00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,710
are there any questions yeah

00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,329
sure okay so the question was what kind

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,520
of hardening security firewalling are we

00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:02,589
doing well out of box pc-bsd is

00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,839
pre-configured with the PF firewall

00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:06,789
which is from it's in freebsd but that

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:09,549
originated from the openbsd guys who are

00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:11,049
known for their security so that's all

00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:12,549
on by default and it's usually pretty

00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,140
restricted there's only a couple ports

00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:17,079
open for allowing you to do samba

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,809
file-sharing I mean that's about it as

00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,599
far as other hardening goes the basis of

00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:23,859
freebsd is pretty hardened already we

00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:25,539
don't have to turn on a whole lot of

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:27,010
extra stuff I think we have deny hosts

00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:29,319
running in the background so if you fire

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,930
up SSH we can look for brute force

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:33,730
attack attempts etc but that's that's

00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,410
about the bulk of it we've done and so

00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,880
far nobody's suggested anything better

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,549
that we could do because FreeBSD is

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,299
pretty paranoid by default we're just

00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:45,579
kind of piggybacking off of that that

00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:55,390
answer your question okay any other

00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:57,220
questions yeah what was that okay yeah

00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,319
the question was our OS updates handled

00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,500
by the same FreeBSD update utility it's

00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:04,270
in freebsd the answer is not now we're

00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,549
exploring that 49 that may be a

00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,020
possibility the FreeBSD update utility

00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:09,789
for those who don't know is just an easy

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,650
way to keep your kernel up to date in

00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,390
your world up to date for security

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,329
advisories that come out say for freebsd

00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,680
82 that'll help us but it doesn't go the

00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:19,630
rest of the way it doesn't use security

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,880
updates of the packages so we're

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,700
investigating using part of that as our

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,319
update solution for nine right now it's

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,230
not been it's not finished yet or in a

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,369
workable form and the alpha is OS but

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,660
that'll be part of it we have to write

00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:33,099
the other end of it which takes care of

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,410
your package is still that are part of

00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:40,650
the base desktop but yeah probably some

00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,650
form of that'll end up at nine so yeah

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,900
oh okay a question was what partition

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:50,089
format is preferred ext4 etc well ext4

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,640
is not an option it's free be as these

00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:54,170
options are ufs has been there long term

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,829
file system they've been using that for

00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:00,470
a while in 82 it's ufs with soft updates

00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:02,960
and nine it's ufs with soft updates and

00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:06,170
journaling so no more long f6 after a

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,730
crash the other option is ZFS and that

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,980
was in the installed movie there's just

00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,630
a check box you turn that on it creates

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,369
your ZFS pool you can even go into

00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:16,160
advanced and add in your raid and

00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:18,170
mirroring etc and it'll it'll use those

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,720
but those are the two options ZFS and

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,269
you FS or some variety of that and you

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,599
can intermingle those that will I will

00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:28,609
usually take aufs boot partition and

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,920
then an encrypted ZFS partition or

00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:32,480
something for a laptop so it's got an

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,150
encryption layer on top of it so if

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:44,440
somebody steals my laptop they can't get

00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:44,440
into my data any other questions yeah

00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,110
question is how is support for wireless

00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,550
devices if you haven't used freebsd in a

00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,380
while it was pretty cloudy there for a

00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,180
while but it's getting much better a lot

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,680
of devices was just supported out a box

00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:01,870
just work you're a thorough so your

00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,250
Intel chipsets your raw link etc it lags

00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,600
a little behind Linux I'll be honest

00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,980
with you I mean there's there's probably

00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,050
less developers working on it but

00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,960
usually when the support gets at it it's

00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,460
it just saw it works but you know most

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,110
systems today you just throw it on there

00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,640
and it just works it's it's you end up

00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,440
with an odd chipset here there were

00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,020
we're still waiting for a driver from

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,370
so-and-so to make it happen but yeah the

00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,140
wireless support has gotten a lot better

00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:28,090
if you've not used freebsd in the last

00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:29,890
couple years and same thing as far as

00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,990
drivers goes I you know honestly one of

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,360
the biggest things we see as a challenge

00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,370
on freebsd and pc-bsd is dealing with

00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,740
drivers you know there's a lot of effort

00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,550
going to linux drivers say for the intel

00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:43,180
for video or ati or whatnot

00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,520
unfortunately those are taking a very

00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,440
linux eccentric development route which

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,510
makes it difficult to port back to

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,970
freebsd you're open or net or whoever

00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,920
and so we lag behind in a lot of those

00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:56,110
ways our preferred video right now is

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,550
just an nvidia honestly we have a good

00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,860
working relationship with the nvidia

00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:02,230
guys they release awesome binary drivers

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,700
for our system which with this last

00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,930
release we put some stuff into our

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,610
kernel which they said makes our

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,820
performance equivalent to windows in

00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:11,860
some ways and as far as just raw GPU

00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,390
power so you know we've had a good

00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,830
relationship with those guys we we

00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,110
recommend their products because it just

00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:22,780
works out of box you plug in and it goes

00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:25,600
so yes question was do we have CUDA

00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,010
support for bsd and answer is no not now

00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,710
we can run it through the linux

00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:32,200
emulation i believe but we don't have

00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,970
native support although i may change in

00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,770
the future we'll see i don't know the

00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:39,720
status is on that thumb rot and I'm not

00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:44,440
involved with the development of that so

00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,880
anything else guys great thank you guys

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,960
so much for coming being a great

00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,960
audience preciate

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,510
what about this I can help the like it

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,510
we have the same problem

00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,340
let's put the word out

00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,340
you

00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,970
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:38,560
all we do is hosted computing to us the

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:40,510
cloud is just the next generation of

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,460
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,620
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,120
work in a unique position to really help

00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,160
bring these two worlds together these

00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,320
different sets of technologies and to

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,720
help companies embrace this new world in

00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,060
this great new tool that allows faster

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,070
innovation not only is it about us being

00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:03,550
responsive and accountable but it's

00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:06,190
about us doing more for you webos an OS

00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:09,220
that works the way that you do across

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:12,510
all your devices HP Slate and whether
