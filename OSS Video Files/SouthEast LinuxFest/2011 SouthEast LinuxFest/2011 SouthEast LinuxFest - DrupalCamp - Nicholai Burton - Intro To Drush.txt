org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,180
to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,380
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,380
make these videos possible

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,610
alright well this feels really loud

00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,700
hello better I think I think so yeah

00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:00,309
it's a dress is a really cool

00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,739
command-line utility to let you just

00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:04,150
type in a few words to do what normally

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:09,580
would take you a lot of clicking and

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:12,160
moving around and browsing your site so

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,650
drush stands for Drupal shell it's

00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,399
that's basically a special kind of

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,840
command show like a bash but it does

00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:21,700
Drupal stuff it's like a little Swiss

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,320
Army knife to turn you into a Drupal

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,940
ninja drush is used for a lot of

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,369
different kinds of stuff you can install

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:34,539
sites update stuff modules core anything

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:39,100
download and install new modules and

00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:41,460
enable them perform backups it's kind of

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,780
a release management staging thing

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,690
personally I don't like to use it like

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,970
that on its own but more with something

00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,700
like an AG or setup which takes

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,650
advantage of the dress staging features

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,479
it's got a sequel command line so and a

00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,210
PHP command line so you can run straight

00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,990
page Pierce equal trip through the the

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,000
dress shell we can run user management

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,619
tasks you can create users on the fly

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,920
block them delete them whatever and

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:10,149
there's just it's it's pretty limitless

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,549
like whatever you want to come up with

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,019
for a dress command that you want you

00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:18,400
can script it because everything is

00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:20,739
documented so I'm going to take a look

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,019
here at a typical setup you know you get

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,459
started on a new site you need the first

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,190
thing you need there's always like cck

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:32,380
reviews so you go to c ck find the link

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:37,090
download w get on thar go to your admin

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,709
module site check off those modules are

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,650
you know for cck checking like five

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,720
different boxes go save go yes and then

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,220
it's been like 10 or 12 minutes waiting

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:52,870
for all that to happen so with drush

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,459
drush download cck done like that's it's

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,560
gone to the website it's found the

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,090
latest recommended release

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,970
it's brought it down it son tired it

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,069
unzipped it stuck it in the right folder

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,360
giving it the right name and then once

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:07,940
it's downloaded if we want to enable it

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,709
one more command drush en for an able

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,709
i'm going to turn on the content number

00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,420
and text from CC k and that little dash

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,680
wise says go ahead and say yes don't ask

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,310
me if I want to enable it because I just

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,069
told you I did so from 10 minutes to

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,360
about 10 seconds is pretty awesome

00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:25,430
because you can you know / cider /

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,690
module and this can take multiples I can

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,030
say drush dlc ck views token web form

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,540
and just stick a space between each one

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,160
it'll grab them all so that's like

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,840
that's kind of level one first time use

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,970
dress you're like holy crap i just saved

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,019
myself a bunch of time so now a new

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,959
release comes out on something a

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:51,200
security release comes out for I don't

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,549
know file field which means there's also

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,660
going to be security released for image

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,340
field for like two or three other

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,489
modules because they you know a lot of

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,590
these kind of release in sync so before

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,660
you'd have to go to the site delete the

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,359
old version download the new version

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:08,060
unzip it go to update dot PHP I with

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:11,030
drush we just say p.m. update p.m. means

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,609
package manager or project enough

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,380
package manager take the ones I want to

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,840
update so there's a new views and token

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,120
release out do my little right at the

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,789
end and those two modules will be

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,750
updated to the newest security release

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,200
or if I just want to do the whole site

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,970
you know I'm in Deb it doesn't matter

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,470
i'll go ahead and just p.m. update and

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,610
i'll do every module that has a newer

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,080
release that will go ahead and grab an

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,979
update at once so you don't have to

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,900
specify them any questions about

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:44,110
download update and able modules kind of

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,110
stuff

00:04:50,870 --> 00:05:02,810
we can define that and I will pull up an

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:09,720
example so we would you like brush dl

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:14,970
views six point x three point 0 alpha

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,670
whatever it is right now i don't know

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,680
let's just guess if it doesn't exist it

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,930
won't download it of course so yeah you

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,150
can you can specify specific versions

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,530
just otherwise it will automatically

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,890
assume you wanted the latest release

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,890
version

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,940
you

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,160
how do we like start here there we go so

00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,530
another really cool thing is

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,330
integrations if you build a module and

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,590
you want it to have Josh commands for

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,699
other people to use right out of the box

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,960
you can some examples backup and migrate

00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,610
has done some integration like they've

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,770
got some drush commands to do an

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,500
immediate you know database backup for

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,210
your restore these bulk operations devel

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,630
so you can like rush and generate 50

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,520
nodes then maybe for your test sites you

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,259
need to create X number of nodes of

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,720
these content types and 50 users and a

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,160
bunch of comments and you know you you

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,960
can either write yourself some sequel

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,970
scripts to try to do all that or you can

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,880
go to the develop age seven or eight

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,229
times and do each peach piece or you

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,190
know write a couple of lines of drush

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:31,979
and bam you've got like a full-on

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:34,080
instead of sample data it also

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,729
integrates with features and just

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,870
there's there's tons of modules out

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,570
there though some of the more popular

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:47,460
ones have pretty cool drush commands

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:48,930
available so one thing I'm probably not

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,639
going to like show here but that you

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,430
should know about is when I was

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,099
mentioning the staging stuff josh has

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,509
this concept of sight aliases and the

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:00,900
site aliases don't have to be on the

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:02,310
same box so if I've got five clients

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,919
with five different servers that I'm

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:09,120
doing stuff for I can create an alias on

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,070
my box and each one of those will have

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,120
either a stored username and password or

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,639
a key file and I can you know I can

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,030
brush you know p.m. update core when

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,009
6.22 come came out immediately from

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,930
their site without having to like go to

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,180
their site get into she'll try to find

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,349
all that info and run through it so

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,469
there's all kinds of little time savers

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,919
like that but you can use it to just

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:35,969
push your changes out so if you have

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,469
you've been working in dev and you want

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,099
to push to this client site there's a

00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:42,539
dress command to basically do an rsync

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,430
to whatever your changed files are go

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:51,150
out to there to push them out to their

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:53,760
site so what I love about drush is drush

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,980
make it's like drush

00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,510
I don't want to say on steroids cuz they

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,290
do very different things but drush make

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:05,070
is one dress command and one drush make

00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,900
file you can build a website if most of

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,150
your projects involve the same 15

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,130
modules as a starting point you can

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,550
either create install profiles for that

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,610
or you can create a make file and a make

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,310
file says I want these projects these

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,740
themes even these libraries if I need to

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,770
go get ckeditor or a version of jQuery

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,750
UI or something like that the dress make

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,010
file can go out handle that bring it in

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,500
I can't even tell it where I want to put

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,800
that on the site which is very cool

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,479
stuff and that's basically what it takes

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,760
to make one in terms of the command I

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:45,540
tell it where my make file is and I tell

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:48,540
it what folder I want to build for me so

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,250
for doing your first make file if you

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,800
haven't done this before go home and

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:55,650
check out drush make me they've got a

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,060
generator so you can kind of get an idea

00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,510
of what things look like just by

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,120
checking a few boxes it'll generate a

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,270
make file and make files are really cool

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,490
because they're descriptive you're not

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,400
doing as much scripting with it you're

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,350
saying you know that when we look at one

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,470
will say like project equals c ck

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,080
project equals views so someone who's

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,400
not necessarily as well versed can still

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,920
pick it up pretty quickly they can learn

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,060
by example and just you know take that

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,920
and run with it when when they're trying

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,320
to get themselves up to speed on drush

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,200
make its shareable if I build a make

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,850
file and I send it to you then you can

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,730
run it on your box to you you know

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:39,990
there's nothing machine specific about

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:43,080
it again we're usable make it once use

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,930
it for your next 20 sites recursion

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,540
recursion is awesome if you have a

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,660
module that has a make file in it then

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,900
when you used rush make to download and

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,520
get that module it'll see that that

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,920
module has a make file and it will grab

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,330
any of its dependencies so that in

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,620
certain situations there's kind of a

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,130
chance for dependency hell where you

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,059
might end up in some kind of loop but on

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,009
one example is ckeditor there's a

00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,239
drama over whether or not they want the

00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,949
make file in there but it was there for

00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,989
a while because you'd always have to get

00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:18,159
that library whenever you wanted it same

00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:19,809
for imc erna imc tiny MCE but if they

00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,399
specify that make file in there module

00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:22,899
then it'll go ahead and grab that

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:27,029
download and put it in place as part of

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:44,499
the module install so pretty cool stuff

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:45,759
any questions so far yeah and you don't

00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:48,369
have to tell it anything to make that

00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,249
happen drush will automatically it's

00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:52,929
rather than deleting those old files for

00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:54,549
a modular for core it's going to move

00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:57,369
them into a backup folder and download

00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:59,799
the fresh stuff so for some reason you

00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:01,109
had hacked a module you know or there

00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,939
was a patch that you had to put in place

00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:05,469
you haven't lost that that info still

00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:07,539
around it's just one level one or two

00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:08,949
levels higher in your site generally

00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:16,839
outside the site directory so it's not

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:18,639
findable by anyone on the web but so a

00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,479
make file has a few things that you just

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,979
have to do right now you have to set

00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:27,819
this one little field that says API

00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:29,439
equals to as the dress API changes I'm

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,049
sure that numbers going to increment but

00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:34,899
just take it as a given you have to

00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:39,699
specify what core you want the wager

00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:41,319
drush make figures out how to how to

00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,699
know which recommended version to get if

00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,989
something's got a six recommended

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,179
version in a second recommended version

00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:48,309
we have to tell it which one we want

00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,929
everything to be based off of so it's

00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:52,929
always either six point X or seven point

00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:55,329
X and then since we're making a site

00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:57,699
there it has the ability to create sites

00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:00,459
without core if you just want to get

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:01,599
site files I haven't found a use case

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,369
for that yet so I haven't really worked

00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:06,729
with it but generally you're going to

00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:09,399
say what project it's going to suggest a

00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:12,489
project's Drupal type equals core and

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,629
this will download the cord rupal if

00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:16,559
you're using press flow we can handle

00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,609
that I'm going to show that in a second

00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,289
but once you've got those first three

00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,590
lines done we can start putting our in

00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:24,580
our

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:26,080
modules in so the basic version just

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,030
projects equals views that's going to go

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,880
to sites all modules and throw reviews

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,020
in there but if you run a slight where

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,110
you do a lot of modules and you want to

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,700
separate contribs off your building

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,350
you're going to go ahead and there's a

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,480
additional place in the array you can

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,950
just say where you wanted to go so the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,630
second one here is going to go to sites

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:48,040
all modules contribs so you can keep

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,210
things nice and neat during the install

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:55,030
you don't have to let it happen and then

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:57,340
move it all around and as I mentioned

00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,230
you can do libraries you can do regular

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,240
web downloads you can do get you can do

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,160
svn they all have their own little

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,560
syntax that's in a documentation for it

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,560
but here's an example of going to get

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,580
the grab Dula latest tiny MCE so we say

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,760
our our type will either be HTTP GET or

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,410
svn where we're getting it from and then

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,090
with the director eating this will

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,320
forget it's the directory name for HTTP

00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:25,660
obviously you're just going straight to

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,730
the file so if you need to for some

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,160
reason grab branch or trunk I believe

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:37,300
there's also a tag thing we can give in

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:38,560
here so multi-site side I'd mention I

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,020
haven't really had a use case for this I

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,600
don't love the way it works but you can

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,420
add an extra command to drush make to

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,690
say no court and just specify a bunch of

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,760
modules and themes I generally put my

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,800
modules in the all folder so when I'm

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,140
just creating a new site I don't need to

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,880
go and run this again but for some

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,190
reason your practices that you're

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,340
putting modules in specific client site

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,390
folders this could you know this can

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,220
work out with you so that you don't have

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,270
to download the whole thing only to pull

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,430
out the parts you need because then

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,430
you're just doing manual work again so

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,940
so what can't it do I said installs

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,010
earlier and by installs I meant it can

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,020
get everything in place what dress might

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,580
can't do is create your setup your

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,650
settings dot PHP file and create a

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,540
database and match them up and get you

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,680
going right away if you need that

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,800
instantly you'd want to look into

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,480
install profiles but it gets you all the

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,910
way there except for this last couple of

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,140
steps which is in itself pretty awesome

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,820
and the tools like a gear that I'd been

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,450
mentioned this morning there's one or

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,010
two sessions on today they let you

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,630
create your make file and you give it to

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:57,930
them and they'll handle the rest of the

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:59,700
installation so and rush make can't

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,440
enable modules themselves it downloads

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,670
as an all and puts them in place but

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,130
then once you've got your dress

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,840
Makepeace done just run you know drush

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:14,250
he in for an able and then all those

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:16,110
ones that you brought in that's for just

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,700
your ability to look at it later but I

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,700
wanted to show a couple of make files I

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:31,140
don't want to start with something

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:33,050
really empty so this is kind of a make

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,790
file its most basic very uncomplicated

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,430
I'd mentioned tell her what your core

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,740
version is tell it the API equals two

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,860
and then I'm going to grab regular core

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:48,240
Drupal cck and views that's a make file

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:50,010
that will work pretty straightforward

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,610
stuff you're just describing what you

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,610
want it to do

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:03,290
so I grab another one and I wanted to

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,489
show how you don't have to use just

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,379
regular core here I'm doing press flow

00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:12,019
so I'm saying that press flow is Mike or

00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:15,019
rather than the other one saying project

00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:15,949
Drupal core and then I'm telling you

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:21,470
where to go to grab the latest version

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:24,649
so if some other version like that comes

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,209
out I don't see it happening because

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,879
press flow is pretty awesome as it is

00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:30,259
but you'd have the ability to to specify

00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,749
what you want your core project to be I

00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,269
think you can use install profiles there

00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:37,069
but I may be wrong if you wanted to like

00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:49,429
specify an open atrium make file or

00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:52,989
something yes I'm sure yeah I guess just

00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:58,850
let me know where to send it okay good

00:16:52,989 --> 00:17:01,579
okay and then for cleanliness I like to

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,069
I separate it out i got this practice

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,689
from the dress make me site when i

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:09,289
generated my first couple of files it's

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:11,449
just easier to read because it's stick a

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:16,610
semicolon it front to comment that line

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:19,130
out and you're good to go so the bottom

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,839
when i'd mentioned projects so those are

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,929
modules and themes and then libraries if

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,579
i tell it that i'm downloading a library

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:27,409
it knows to put it in the sites all

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:33,200
libraries folder instead of in another

00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:34,789
place but i can also specify if i need a

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,620
specific download destination for it

00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,750
there's another little piece i can put

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,600
into this array that says i think it's

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,019
called destination folder to say where i

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,019
want it to go

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,290
so they're all 6 i'll show you a basic

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:57,230
seven concepts are exactly the same the

00:17:54,290 --> 00:18:01,690
only thing i change very first line core

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,690
7 point x now so

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:19,190
that was actually first sight I was

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:23,230
building yeah so those are I mean I've

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,520
got more sample files but these are all

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,990
there's not a lot of variety that you do

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,020
with it I mean it's kind of these are

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,520
the rules and here's where you're going

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,610
to fit your modules your themes your

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,860
libraries your core version drush mate

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,270
can also do patches if you know for some

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,800
reason you're going to download the

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,270
recommended version of a module and you

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,430
need a patch that hasn't been committed

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:50,990
yet you can go ahead and grab that patch

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:54,680
as part of the process to and I'm

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:57,350
actually using brush within like this

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,570
whole setup in here in my vm is the

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,830
QuickStart project so if you want to

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,240
play with dress or without trying to

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,540
figure out how to install it I recommend

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,390
it drupal.org project quick start it's

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,850
um it's a virtual disk that's got a bun

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,750
to with brush set up a couple of really

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,860
cool drush commands on it already like

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,480
how I mentioned you can create your own

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:24,550
so these guys have created one called

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:34,750
quick create and so I can say drush QC

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:34,750
for quick create make file and domain

00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:47,070
and this is what it would look like when

00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:50,549
you're doing any kind of dress make it's

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,110
gonna let you know as it goes found core

00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,129
found so and so for each of your modules

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,119
it'll say whether or not it found the

00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:59,220
latest version I feel like it's a little

00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,480
more robust now I for a while it was

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,740
kind of fragile where if you had a

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,820
problem in your make file the whole

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,519
thing would just kind of crap out on you

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,220
halfway through and I think now it's a

00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,220
little better at error handling and you

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,240
can tell it there's like a I can extra

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,269
little parameter we can give it that

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,320
says like ignore errors and keep going

00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:22,320
so so right now I've just created a new

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,970
site and with the with the quick start

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,769
module it does some of those extra

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,119
commands I'd mentioned like it created

00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,159
my database and set my settings about

00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,600
PHP file so you can write your own dress

00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,090
commands to do those extra things at the

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,419
end of the process if you want to your

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:39,419
deira you know script might be a dress

00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:41,279
make command and then after that you can

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,619
use the sequel CLI from dress to create

00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,440
your database to set your user and then

00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,360
use the PHP CLI to open up your settings

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,090
dot PHP file and tell us that stuff in

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,350
so in theory three or four lines of code

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,090
you can go ahead and have the full thing

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:59,580
installed without having to learn how to

00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:01,889
code install profiles so josh is a some

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,200
pretty cool time saver and it's got a

00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:05,789
lot of features there's I'm kind of just

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,960
breaking the surface on it myself like

00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,730
these are the things I've worked with

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,919
but I know there's there's even more

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,470
stuff in there that I haven't begun to

00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,409
dive into and it's has pretty regular

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,999
releases and improvements I did a

00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,279
session on civvy crm this morning and

00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,869
there's the beginnings of a project to

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,429
add rush commands to that so that you

00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:25,429
can automate like mailings and things

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,039
so that's kind of the orig the initial

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:38,539
dress overview I want to see what

00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:40,549
questions you've got I didn't think I

00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:43,190
could actually just dude me talking

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:59,380
about dress for a whole hour look I'm on

00:21:43,190 --> 00:22:02,870
command line the oh the site aliases

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,730
it's not too difficult once you've done

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,279
it a few times you're going to create a

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,720
file I'd mentioned creating on your own

00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,750
commands this is similar to creating

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,679
your own command you create your own

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:18,110
include file for it basically and drush

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,700
knows to look for it based on the file

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,950
name your file name will be what you

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:26,630
want the alias to be so it might be like

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:30,080
you know staging dot drush RC tank or

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,700
something like that and then within that

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,570
file you're going to set the actual

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,279
hostname and some credentials and that

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:43,000
way and then from that point on whenever

00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:49,399
you're doing it you would say brush at

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,950
staging go ahead and grab the path auto

00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:56,299
module so so setting it up setting up

00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:01,130
your first side alias will take a little

00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:03,620
bit and there's a weighted like I said

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:06,529
there's a way to generate like a key so

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,000
that you don't get prompted for password

00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:08,960
like login and password and you'll have

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,679
to store it in the file if you don't

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,520
want to you can just point it to that to

00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,260
the key so but that's well-documented

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:25,179
and I've only barely begun to dive into

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,179
splat and deciding leases yes

00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,720
with this guy will do this this would be

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,840
the slide alias so rather than looking

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:43,879
on localhost it would go to my alias ww

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,009
staging drupalcon org and that just

00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:55,879
saves me the time of ss aging into every

00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:59,059
box that I want to do something on so

00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:02,590
drush WS has their their full command

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:05,389
reference and for the dress makes side

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,220
they've got a the readme file it

00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:08,389
specifies like every command and what it

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,700
does and promote something even gives

00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:19,970
examples and if you don't want to look

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:21,859
that far Josh actually embeds to help so

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,210
I can actually get my help in line for

00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:31,369
every one of these things so I want help

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:35,720
on I don't know if there's a dash in

00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:37,519
that or not yeah so it tells me exactly

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,480
what i need to do if i wanted to do the

00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,489
dress command for a command-line

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,330
interface so very similar to the way you

00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:49,100
do like a hook like basically hook help

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:50,899
for regular modules the Jewish API has

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,429
the equivalent of a hook where you just

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:55,119
fine what the help is what the help

00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:55,119
information says

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:08,200
any anything you've wondered if drush

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:09,610
can do it anything you guys are doing

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,440
manually that that you'd love to

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:16,450
automate it just drives you crazy during

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:29,440
every build or during just daily

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:31,870
maintenance yep that's something dress

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,299
can do too i can i can run cron with

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:44,890
rush i can i can clear clear cache all

00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:46,539
of them or just the block cash but yeah

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,100
if you wanted to scheduled rush to do a

00:25:46,539 --> 00:26:12,370
series of commands just create a batch

00:25:48,100 --> 00:26:13,330
file for it yeah I've the first I heard

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,669
about that command was actually this

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,399
morning to I had not run across that

00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:21,070
before so it might just be a like drush

00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:27,399
five thing and I haven't gotten my way

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:28,899
there yet and compatibility with drush

00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:32,140
don't worry about it just grab the

00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,730
latest drush is Drupal version

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,690
independent it knows which version

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,899
you're going to be on when you're doing

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,370
things so if happier slider in six and

00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:43,860
half four and seven don't even worry

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:43,860
about it just runs rush and it'll now

00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,429
I've seen that with drush make but I

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,840
haven't seen anything with drush

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:58,029
commands with get right unless you're

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,590
maybe lime I mean you could use it to

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:05,620
push things back up but you've already

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:07,570
got get commands for that so I want to

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,140
say dressed even has like a CLI I just

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,140
don't remember the

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:17,129
that's probably not it it wouldnt have

00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:18,570
held on but you can you can even add

00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:20,940
that as like a shortcut or put it in

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,980
your if you're making a batch file drush

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,509
has its own CLI where I can I can skip

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,450
the first word so now I'm just down to

00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:29,820
dl token because it's already put itself

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:34,619
into its own version oh I did get it

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,909
right look at that so it's just like a

00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,749
regular command line but the dress

00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:42,499
commands are already built in so I'm not

00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:42,499
actually on a site

00:27:52,010 --> 00:28:00,140
and then I can just do clear all my cash

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:08,450
I do not have any cash on that site it

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:09,560
might not be a working site all right I

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:15,820
know that's working site all right

00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,820
that's me doing something wrong oh is it

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:32,240
will pick a different command then there

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,340
we go and that should be doing this

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,930
thing so all right i just picked a bad

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,520
command for my first example i didn't

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,010
know there was like conflict with a c

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,650
compiler but i skipped the direction

00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:49,130
just download path auto and it's there

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:50,270
and now I didn't force it to say yes so

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:55,570
it's going to ask me if I want to enable

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,570
it and I'll just throw it a quick yes

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:00,500
and now those wrong and you saw it just

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,960
like when you work through the front end

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,340
I didn't have path turned on so it went

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,620
ahead and said hey I'm going to turn on

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,760
path when I turn on path audit so I mean

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,410
is that it needs to handle that just

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,280
like the modules page would do when

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:21,620
you're checking something that has a

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:28,360
dependency oh that's an error with

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:28,360
actions so whatever other questions

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,480
if you're going to spend all day and

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,550
rush i think it makes sense to save

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,770
yourself some key strokes but for me I'm

00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:42,940
going in on spending five minutes taking

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,790
care of a few sites and then getting

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,920
back out so typing drush and extra you

00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,110
know 10 or 11 times it hasn't been a big

00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,300
deal for me but if you spend a

00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,530
significant amount of time there it's

00:29:51,300 --> 00:30:09,250
you know it's it's another just a nice

00:29:53,530 --> 00:30:11,140
little shortcut I do not know i i'm

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,440
officially during my day job I work on a

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:29,850
windows box so high I know just enough

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:29,850
linux to get by that any Drupal okay

00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,890
okay

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:56,960
let's just put that on silent yes it's

00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:05,690
added i think in for it added that

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:08,230
ability where's Whitney 25 right I don't

00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,140
think it was I think for introduced it

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:14,570
but yeah I can keep itself up to date

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,460
and so everything that a gear does from

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,409
those other sessions it does it's just

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,880
giving you a front end it's giving you a

00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:23,240
front end to the command line shortcuts

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,570
to the other front end stuff so when you

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,360
create a new site in a year what that

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,980
does or you create a new platform it you

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,299
feed it a make file and it runs drush

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,799
make to get all the stuff and then it

00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,960
runs a few more drush commands to create

00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:39,049
a database set your settings like PHP

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,029
file Colonel caching do some stuff with

00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:44,149
vhosts so that way the domain stuffs

00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:46,039
correct so a gear is really a front-end

00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:48,260
I feel like a Fernand rush I know it

00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,889
does a lot more but it bases a lot of

00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:54,649
its stuff off of the dress API so you're

00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:56,659
really just using using Drupal to used

00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:59,169
rush to use Drupal and it gets kind of

00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:59,169
weird and meta

00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:13,000
no you stuff to use like you have to go

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,559
into command line and dude rush for that

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:36,330
or you have to download them it doesn't

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:36,330
have any kind of package management nice

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:51,100
okay I can see some of these like drush

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,539
becoming a more and more important tool

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,850
and possibly even becoming more of a

00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:57,460
core thing in the future and I mean I

00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:01,240
won't make it for a time sure but it

00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,740
yeah because a lot of these times we're

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,509
using dress to get around usability

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,240
problems or slow that you know

00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:08,139
administration problems in Drupal itself

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,129
so we've solved that problem with the

00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:12,870
tool but then we put another tool in

00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:12,870
front of that to work to run that tool

00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,890
exactly it's huge like a non shared

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,050
hosting if you can get it installed some

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,760
will let you some want I've run drush on

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,080
dreamhost and blue host I know a and

00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,270
hosting will not let you install it

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,900
because they won't let you use PHP CLI

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:55,900
and that's what drush does it uses PHP

00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:57,190
CLI so I never go the whole time you can

00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,110
install our you download install themes

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:02,110
just like you or download things anyway

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:06,760
just like you would modules so I mean I

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:12,040
can grab fusion if I wanted the fusion

00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:15,010
engine and then i could just turn on

00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:29,100
fusion starter or whatever can any can I

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:29,100
do this will this work right okay

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:54,169
very nice yeah you can draw the brush be

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:55,130
set and then it's it's yeah khaki i kid

00:34:54,169 --> 00:35:03,350
i don't know how to remember the name of

00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:07,550
the variable but i have not tried that

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:12,440
yet I know it is supposed to be able to

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:15,560
do that right I haven't seen it in

00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,660
action anywhere in the wild I follow the

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:26,540
planet pretty closely and haven't seen

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:30,190
anyone post on it there so anybody

00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,190
already using dress yes

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,730
now make is just for making yeah it

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,290
doesn't know what if there's already a

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,820
site there it won't build it because it

00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,040
will see that I've already got one in

00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,110
place so it's literally just for the

00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:01,720
initial grouping all your stuff together

00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:03,040
getting in place right like once you

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,200
brought it in or if you if you know

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,520
during the process of doing your initial

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,050
build that you're going to need the dev

00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,210
version of something or an alpha that

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:15,130
it's not recommended we just specify

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:20,100
that in the make file I think one of

00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:20,100
these I've set a specific version

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,390
I don't have one here all right but we

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,829
can akka mean I can specify it I'll

00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,930
should go ahead and show you actually

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:47,760
since we've got plenty of time left

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:51,940
drush make me for doing your first one

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:56,020
very easy to start with pick my version

00:36:51,940 --> 00:37:03,070
pick my distro I never see a reason to

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:10,380
use core anymore I'll grab admin cck and

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:10,380
there's a couple of random things seem

00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:19,150
and then I can tell it where I want to

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,470
put on modules and generate and that's

00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:26,380
how easy it is to make your first mate

00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:29,140
file and check some boxes so installing

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,960
drush I didn't touch much on but it's

00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,790
it's not too tough it can be it's a huge

00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,680
pain on a windows box if you're working

00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,930
in that set up like the ex anpp stack

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,430
you have to do so much just to get it to

00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:46,180
work there but on a on a linux box it's

00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:50,920
pretty easy to create basically like the

00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:55,060
dot drush folder in the in your in your

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,310
user folder and then it's basically like

00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,660
you would alias anything else so yeah

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:04,660
once you alias it you don't have to

00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:06,010
browse to it to execute every time yeah

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,970
I wouldn't recommend trying to do it on

00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,970
windows just yet though

00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:18,550
it it does but you have to do a lot of

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,780
OS things to make it work you have to

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,270
modify a couple of the dress files

00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:27,150
themselves you have to download a bunch

00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:29,920
of um okay windows doesn't have W get or

00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,270
tar or gzip or any of these other

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,650
libraries that you need so you have to

00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,880
find all those libraries and some

00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,020
versions are out of date and you have to

00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,390
go to sites that aren't the official

00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,310
site to get the right version and you

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,520
have to download bsd tar but rename it

00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:44,200
tar and there's there's weird

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,300
complications like that and then drush

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,270
make seems a little more hairy on

00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,070
Windows but doable I'm slowly working

00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,900
through like step-by-step instructions

00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,400
that I'm going to stick on the internets

00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,400
for folks trying to do dress on windows

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,410
I have not used so much I mean I'll use

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,700
it for like de ville when I want to

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,880
generate a bunch of nodes or a bunch of

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,540
content and i'll use it to make backups

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,830
and move things around but i haven't it

00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,620
hasn't really made its way a whole lot

00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:25,900
into my toolbox in terms of developer

00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,680
stuff it's definitely got the commands

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,680
for it but

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,490
you

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,880
right

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:22,500
right yeah

00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,620
yeah automating backups you had

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,530
mentioned you know we create a batch

00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,490
file so I use the backup and migrate

00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,550
that's that's the way i would i would do

00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:53,190
with backup and migrate just because i

00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,630
love that module but you know I I could

00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,760
easily run address command that just

00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:01,820
does a sequel dump of my database to an

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:04,320
out file somewhere and then run a

00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,460
Brunson add other stuff in our batch

00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,340
file to move it around or move it to

00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,720
another site or i could probably if i

00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,150
played with it enough use the slight

00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,700
aliases to push my backups from one

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,720
server to another just for safekeeping

00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,720
not even for like sinking

00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,670
does anybody here not installed rushed

00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:47,570
before tried it are we mostly

00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:54,920
first-timers I hope no yeah all right

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:56,960
there is enthusiasm well the projector

00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,280
went out on me but I don't really have a

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,820
whole lot of other just show unless you

00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,200
guys have some more questions is there

00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,200

yeah cuz it's on it says lamps on it's

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:21,160

few years

00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,970
let's let the word out

00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,970
you

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:17,849

00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:23,010
do across all your devices HP Slate and

00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:25,920
webos HP as a service leader in cloud

00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:27,750
computing all we do is hosting computing

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,700
to us the cloud is just the next

00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,170
generation of hosting and if someone

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,789
who's been in the hosting industry for

00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,890
12 years we feel worth in a unique

00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:36,539
position to really help bring these two

00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,549
worlds together these different sets of

00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,710
technologies and to help companies

00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:43,619
embrace this new world in this great new

00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,510
tool that allows faster innovation not

00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,460
only is it about us being responsive and

00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,849
accountable but it's about us doing more
