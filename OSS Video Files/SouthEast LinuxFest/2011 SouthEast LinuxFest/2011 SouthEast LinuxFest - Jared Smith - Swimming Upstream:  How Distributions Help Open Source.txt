the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,929
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,429

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,090
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,240
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,410
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,410
make these videos possible

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,120
they could be here this is my first time

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,250
itself but I've always been a self want

00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,810
to be the last two years I've wanted to

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,100
come down and for different reasons

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,840
haven't been able to make it work with

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,690
my schedule so very happy to be here for

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,420
the for my first time want to talk a

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,400
little bit today about linux

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,750
distributions in the AL plug the door a

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,910
little bit in there but i promise i

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,560
won't go over the top with it but i want

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,420
to talk about how linux distributions

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,480
really helped open source communities to

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,880
thrive and develop so a little bit about

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,010
myself like Leslie said my name is Jared

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,720
Smith somehow I ended up as the Fedora

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,860
project leader will talk about how I got

00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:03,680
there here in a minute but I want to

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:08,110
start off talking about rivers anybody

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,429
like rivers there's my favorite River

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,520
happens to be the Snake River in Wyoming

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,320
is it goes past the Tetons there and

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,150
while I want to talk about rivers I want

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,000
to use rivers as kind of an analogy as I

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,680
go through my talk today but I want to

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,200
talk a little bit about how I got to

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,269
where I am in two ND and so you have a

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,310
little bit of background about me you

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:31,459
know you know who I am and why I believe

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,080
what I believe I grew up in Wyoming and

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,910
for people who have never been in

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,790
Wyoming this is what it looks like most

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,769
of the year we have about nine months of

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,840
winter in the little town I grew up in

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,150
in fact we we used to say there was only

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,820
three seasons in Wyoming last winter

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,010
this winter and next winter but for

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:53,209
those few short warm days during the

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,340
summer it was absolutely beautiful and I

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,900
loved spending time down at the river

00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,280
and I would swim in the river and I

00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,959
would fish in the river and I would

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,380
float down the river on in their inner

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,570
tube and I would you know make rafts and

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,459
float them in the river I spent all my

00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:12,560
summers down down by the river and i

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,510
love i love the concept of rivers in

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,860
there constantly flowing and sometimes

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,030
there's more water and sometimes there's

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,390
less water but there's so many things

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,370
that the river does to not only to bring

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,660
water to the field so you the farmers

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,790
complained their crops and those sorts

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,270
of things but its transportation it's

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,100
it's you know it's so many different

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,830
things when I

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,830
was about oh I must have been 11 or 12

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,010
years old my father and my grandfather

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,860
packed my little brother and I up and we

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,810
drove to the coast of Oregon went salmon

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,250
fishing and it's not the best picture in

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,020
the world but you can see the salmon

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,950
they're trying to swim upstream oh

00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,180
that's strange why do salmon you know

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,520
when they go to spawn why do they go all

00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,680
the way up straight anybody know why

00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,300
they do that yeah they go back to work

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,630
before they respond why did they do that

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,300
though to make babies but why go back to

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,890
that same spot can't think can't they go

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,190
make babies out in the ocean where

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:17,210
they're happy or down in the river where

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,130
ever they don't for some reason they

00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,050
feel that that natural instinct to

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,330
return back to their return back to

00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,250
their roots and so that's what I want to

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,530
talk about today is is kind of like this

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,930
this fish here swimming against the

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,430
current swimming back upstream and why

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,050
that's so important from a from a

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,570
technical standpoint with with linux

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,570
distributions a little bit more about my

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,160
background I went off to university went

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,440
to Utah State got a degree in electrical

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,970
engineering while I was doing my

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,380
electrical engineering work i started

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,020
doing computer work okay they weren't

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,630
quite that old fashioned but one of the

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,210
best classes i had was a class on unix

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,800
and how unix works in learning to use

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,680
the unix tools that just kind of opened

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,020
my eyes that's when I learned to use di

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,760
and I learned that if I looked at my

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,800
fingers that my fingers just didn't work

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,810
right for emacs I just didn't do that

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,390
Vulcan neck pinch on the keyboard to

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,090
make Emacs work for me so I'm a VI fan

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,940
but really what it did is it is it

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,140
opened up my world I decided no I really

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,000
don't want to do circuit boards anymore

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,400
I don't want to do electronics I don't

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,330
want to build robots but I really want

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,390
to do is be a UNIX wizard and so I kind

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,860
of changed my career path got into linux

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,760
in a big way got into systems

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,080
administration had the was very lucky to

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,720
get hired on a little company called

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,450
omniture which got bought out by adobe a

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,870
couple years ago got to manage a little

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,160
server farm of about 6500 servers and

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,740
that's where I really learned there's a

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,090
difference between okay I through

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,240
sana box and here's how to fiddle around

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,289
with it or here's how to really build

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,120
something that works and works well in

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,220
as well engineered from a Linux

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,099
standpoint and a lot of the way along

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,470
the way I got a lot of you know really

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,000
good hands-on introduction to things

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,870
like databases and database

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,009
administration you know storage

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,349
clustering of servers high availability

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:10,780
you know load balancing those those

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,039
sorts of things as well after that I

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,160
took a little break took a little detour

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,680
in my career got into voice over IP in a

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,750
big way got into the asterisk

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
open-source voice over IP project and I

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,620
think there's a couple of different

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,909
presentations on asterisk here tomorrow

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,130
ended up writing an o'reilly book on

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:30,220
asterisk teaching a bunch of asterisk

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,930
classes was the community manager and

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,639
the training manager at digium which is

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,500
kind of the commercial sponsor of the

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,990
asterisk project and had fun with that

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,750
for a number of years and then last

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,270
summer Paul free olds who is the Fedora

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,759
project leader at the time announced

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,800
that he was he was going to pass that

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
baton on to somebody else which happens

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,870
very regularly in fedora every couple of

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,430
years and I don't know if he tricked me

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,599
into thinking I wanted the job or I

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,280
tricked him into thinking I was

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,669
qualified for the job but somehow I

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,080
ended up as the Fedora project leader so

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,550
what does that mean really to be the

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,349
Fedora project later well really it

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,630
means you're the you're the guy with a

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,610
big target on your back you know you're

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,419
the guy that ultimately responsible for

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,180
everything that happens in fedora now

00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,680
it's an interesting role because is the

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,550
Fedora project leader do I have anybody

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,490
who works for me no can I tell people

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,860
what to do they'll have to listen to me

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,750
so it's it's a role with lots and lots

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,620
of responsibilities and very little

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,300
power and so really my my number one

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,599
tool that I use as the thora project

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,800
leader is persuasion I have to go out

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,810
and show people I think this is the

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
right way to go do you agree with me and

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,110
if they agree then I go okay we're

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,280
working together and if they say no then

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,810
I said okay now we've got to find some

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,270
compromise or we got to work this out to

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,940
to be able to move forward and so we

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,770
move forward so let's talk about

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,260
software communities let's talk about

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,970
open source software in particular where

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,729
does software start

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:06,169
let's go to my analogy of a river for a

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,169
minute here where does the river start

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:10,919
with the stores usually there's a spring

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,620
or you know something like that that

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:18,300
that's where the river starts right how

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:21,629
to reverse start out very pretty pretty

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,360
small all right just a little trickle is

00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:26,280
that like software the software usually

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,520
start out with a thousand program or

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,800
starting on it all at once and if only

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,270
is it usually done designed by committee

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,169
at least for the first couple of

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,930
versions how to software start in a

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,380
garage somebody tinkering in their spare

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,910
time man i wish i had a program that did

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,089
ya necessity is the mother of invention

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,230
right so it starts out small it starts

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,029
us with a little trickle somebody has a

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,260
great idea and maybe they're lucky in

00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,720
the friend says hey that's a great i do

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,310
it too i want to help and if you're

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,630
really lucky you get past that those

00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,800
first couple of people and you get three

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,440
or four people following and then you

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,500
get a real you know a real thing going

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,750
you get these these little streams

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,180
merging together and you start to create

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,670
creeks and rivers on that sort of thing

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,480
and then we start talking about software

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:19,230
communities so let me ask this question

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,779
what's a community a group of

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,490
like-minded individuals here's what what

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,070
some people may argue as a community in

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,620
europe is that a community or is that

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,050
just a bunch of houses that happen to be

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,310
geographically close to each other have

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,620
you ever thought about what communities

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,540
you're a part of i think i'm more a part

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,390
of some online communities that I'm part

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,149
of than I am my own neighborhood in my

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,190
yeah my neighborhood Virginia so what is

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:48,450
a community it's like minded individuals

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,550
ah working towards a common goal that

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,029
might be that might be interesting huh

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,570
so I'm always reminded somebody gave

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:59,130
linna's torvalds a newspaper interview

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,320
oh I think it's been five or six years

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,700
ago now and somebody asked him you know

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,920
what's the state of the Linux community

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,750
how's the Linux community doing anybody

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,160
heard this interview before it's

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,690
actually really good Lenna store all

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,540
it's a file I think you've got it all

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,639
wrong there is no linux

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,230
community says there's a bunch of

00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,180
different people using Linux and some

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,350
for their own selfish interests but

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,820
there's not just one thing called the

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,589
community that you go point your finger

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,100
at and say ah that's the community over

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:29,259
there it's just people using the

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,259
software for their own selfish interests

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,019
that's an interesting definition I don't

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,259
quite agree with all of it but it makes

00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:39,889
it certainly makes you think my

00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:42,680
preferred definition of a community is a

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,569
table it's a table that everybody can

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,050
come to sit down at the table share

00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:49,490
ideas share concept hey it wouldn't it

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,139
be great if oh yeah that's a great idea

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,630
let's do that too now know maybe we

00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,940
better do it this way and so it's really

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,529
just a place where people come and sit

00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,089
down and talk one of the things I love

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,709
about events like self and some of the

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,139
other Linux conferences I go to is

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,550
there's always food there's always

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,380
people that need to go out to dinner go

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,839
out to a bar or whatever right there's

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,540
always a chance to sit down across the

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,790
table and share ideas with other people

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,160
that's what community is all about it's

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,500
about the the human bonds that we form

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,670
the friendships that we form the trust

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,220
that we form one you know one person was

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,110
another and yeah the software helps us

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,690
to and but it's really it's really about

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,209
the the human networks that we build as

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,250
we're as we're using software and word

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:36,380
as we're trying to push software for now

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,630
in typical open-source fashion sometimes

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,519
we spend more time talking about well

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,810
what's the shape of the table how many

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,880
seats should to be at the table what

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,089
color should the table be should we hide

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,190
it hide the table under a bike shed

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:51,560
those sorts of discussions right but

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,870
really community is all about sitting

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,000
down sharing ideas and hopefully being

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,370
able to communicate those ideas in a way

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,550
that people are edified and not just

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:06,980
offended okay so my next question if you

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,069
have some software what's kind of the

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:14,110
next step up from there well typically

00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:19,069
you have some sort of distribution right

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,750
so what's the distribution so just a CD

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:22,279
that somebody sends to every six months

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,660
or you download the ISO image off to the

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,149
internet every six months and burn onto

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,120
a CD

00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:32,000
so it's bits and bytes purse or more to

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,370
it than that what kind of what kind of

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,120
things go into a distribution besides

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,120
just bits and bytes

00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,509
I think I think that's a great

00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:58,399
definition you know too many times I

00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,290
think we look at the individual packages

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,269
maybe that go into into an operating

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,279
system and we can talk about that you

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:05,899
know the pros and cons a different

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,730
packaging formats or why packaging

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,259
formats are important I'm guessing most

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,049
of the people here probably already know

00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,339
about rpms and Deb packages and those

00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,110
sorts of things and understand that

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,639
package management is usually a good

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,999
thing it causes a little headache at

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,619
times but but it's generally a good good

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,829
thing makes it easy to install software

00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:27,170
uninstall software know what software

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:29,600
installed a particular file make things

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,339
repeatable which is which is a very

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,809
useful thing hey I did this these five

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:33,769
steps today and I do these five steps

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,350
tomorrow I'm going to get the same

00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:39,589
result that's always a good thing right

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,239
but you know packages I think a software

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:45,970
distribution has to be more than just a

00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:48,889
collection of packages I think you know

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,730
the way I see it is that really linux

00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:55,699
distributions serve three main purposes

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:58,699
when it comes to packages one is they

00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:01,069
aggregate they take a bunch of packages

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:03,019
and they put them together but it's not

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:06,350
just about aggregation it's also about

00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:08,839
collation how many people here have gone

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,939
to a public library I think everybody

00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,889
has right what's the point of a public

00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:18,259
library is it to have every single book

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:19,999
that's out there available yeah easily

00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,410
findable maybe you can they and they

00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,809
they have loan programs where they get

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,549
if the if the library the next town down

00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:28,189
has it they can take and ship into that

00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:31,850
library so that you can use it so it's

00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:34,069
about having the right set of books in

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,049
that location and helping people with

00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,389
the lift the book isn't there easily

00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:40,970
find it and then I think the third point

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:44,689
so it's aggregation it'sit's collation i

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:47,089
think the the third main point is

00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:49,699
integration so instead of just having a

00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,040
collection of packages maybe you have a

00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:54,649
particular set of packages that work

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,499
well together have some kind of unified

00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,579
look and feel and design to them there's

00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,990
some thought about how do the different

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,200
packages plug together there's a lot of

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,350
integration work that

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,220
that goes on so so integration is a key

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,170
part of of why linux distributions exist

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,820
and why they're so important so it's

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,590
kind of like this set of legos it's not

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,990
just the individual blocks but it's what

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:20,250
and what comes out of that is bigger

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:22,280
than just the sum of the parts so that's

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,730
kind of a nice high level overview of

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,050
why linux distributions are important

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,660
but obviously it's more complicated than

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,480
that in real life right it's nice to

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,890
talk in theory up here I and head in the

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,150
clouds kind of thing but it's really

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,760
more complicated in that so I want to

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,890
take it just one level deeper here and

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,190
talk about how do linux distributions

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:47,130
work with and interact with and

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,990
hopefully help upstream software

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,950
communities so I say upstream we get

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,750
first of all I've got to talk about this

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,810
concept again going back to my analogy

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,060
of a river talk about upstream versus

00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:02,550
downstream so let's talk about upstream

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:05,880
first what's up straight well in

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,040
software communities that's orthis where

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,170
the software began in a river it's where

00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,050
the river starts right so upstream is

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,520
the the source of the software the

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,440
people writing the software the people

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,900
changing the software as it goes through

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,300
revisions you know software doesn't

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,600
exist in a vacuum it changes it grows

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,980
it's a living breathing animal so

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,430
upstream is where that software begins

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,250
that's the development community the

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,630
opposite end of that is downstream now

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,970
we all know if we're down stream is for

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,430
a river it's going to flow into a lake

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,420
or it's going to flow into the motion

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:44,010
that sort of thing right what's

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:46,740
downstream for a software project well

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,090
that's your end users right they're not

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,070
the ones developing the software they're

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,830
the ones that are the consumers of that

00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,540
software so everybody understand this

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:59,910
this analogy i'm using of upstream and

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:01,290
downstream so what we end up with again

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,579
a little oversaturated on the picture

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,959
there but this idea of different people

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,270
are at different places in the river

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,070
some people are closer to upstream like

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,220
the gal up there in the front some

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,970
people are a little further downstream

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,539
ok

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,939
so just as an example the distribution I

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,870
care most about Fedora has a policy of

00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,549
following upstream very very closely in

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,100
the early days of Fedora it wasn't quite

00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:31,799
that wasn't quite like that and we found

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,780
through painful experience that trying

00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,700
to maintain a million patches so that we

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,210
didn't have to follow up stream is not a

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,280
sustainable model and so we made a

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,220
conscious decision as a distribution we

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,130
want to follow upstream as much as

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,720
possible with a few exceptions but that

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,730
that's our that's our general principle

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,169
so what we really end up with is if you

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,059
look at this gal up here in the picture

00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:58,169
at the front of the picture she's she's

00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,000
fairly close to the upstream and and

00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,400
then you have other distributions that

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,380
kind of follow and look what Fedora does

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,990
and stay a little further downstream

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,539
from that red hat enterprise linux being

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,190
a good example of that so in fedora were

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,039
kind of you know chart and chart in the

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,590
waters there we're in the lead saying

00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,559
hey what's new you know doing some

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,970
technology incubation doing some placing

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,990
some technology bets and say hey we're

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,299
going to try this and this and this and

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,559
see what works and what doesn't and then

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,789
other distributions like red hat

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,230
enterprise linux or sum of the

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,850
derivatives of that or other

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,120
distributions kind of keep an eye on oh

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,380
yeah that was that was that was in

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,210
fedora and that worked well so we'll

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,679
we'll incorporate it in one of my

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,360
favorite things is is to be at a

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,919
conference in somebody says hey I really

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,049
really like such and such feature in

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,750
this Linux distribution then somebody

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,220
else's oh yeah that was in fedora first

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:51,570
so have you guys heard about the doors

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:55,799
for foundations features friends first

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:58,140
and what am I forgetting freedom so

00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:02,010
first being first is something we take

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,600
pride on in in in fedora I actually

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,150
really really like this picture I wish

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,919
you could see it a little bit better

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,049
because it's at a really really

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,049
interesting place in the world on the

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:16,830
Continental Divide in Wyoming there's a

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:19,289
creek called two oceans past Creek got a

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,220
terrible name but the interesting thing

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:25,549
about this Creek is just a little pygmy

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,140
a mile from where this picture was taken

00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,920
the creek actually splits into right

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,390
along the continent

00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,820
divided it's going along and it splits

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,550
in two and it goes inputs called pacific

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,410
creek or this picture was taken on one

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,380
side that goes into atlantic creek on

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:43,260
the other on this slide on pacific creek

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,940
it goes from from pacific creek into the

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,340
Snake River into the Columbia River and

00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,900
out of the Pacific Ocean on the Atlantic

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,430
creekside it goes in Atlantic Creek it

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,450
goes into the Yellowstone River into the

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,000
Missouri River into the Mississippi

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,790
River to the Gulf of Mexico eventually

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,430
out to the Atlantic and the reason I

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,980
like that as as an analogy here is the

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:06,120
further upstream you are the more

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,650
control you have over what happens from

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,220
from the end-user perspective with the

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,510
software the further downstream you are

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,130
you have very little control you're just

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,260
you're just a user you basically take

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,940
what's what's given to you by upstream

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,370
and that's one of the reasons why I

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,250
think linux distributions really have a

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,550
duty to follow upstream as much as

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,650
possible to have the best possible

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:32,490
chance of making a positive sustainable

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:36,930
long-term impact on on the end user I

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:41,130
like that picture now what else do

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,560
distributions do I hope that will over

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,390
the next few minutes I can talk about

00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,010
you know how to focus on on what's

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,370
important to the linux distribution i

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:53,550
find i find the word focus so to really

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:55,920
you know put things in perspective to

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:58,650
oftentimes a lot of us walk around like

00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,210
this with blinders on and so I like to

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,860
tell people let's zoom out a little bit

00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,750
let's take a little higher view and see

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,670
what one of the things linux

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:10,530
distributions do to really help upstream

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:12,480
communities first of all i think one of

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,070
the number one things that isn't talked

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,310
about with open source software is why

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,690
do people get involved I think I think

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,580
this this has a lot to do with it it's

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,620
not necessarily for the money it's not

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,560
necessarily for the band look put

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,910
something on your resume people feel

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,340
proud to be able to help out with

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,270
something that's bigger than themselves

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,190
and I think that's one of the primary

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,610
motivators that doesn't often get talked

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:38,310
about a lot in an open-source circles so

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,020
one of the things that distributions do

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,630
is they give people a sense of pride

00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,800
a sense of belonging a sense of hey I'm

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,840
working on something that's bigger than

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,490
myself look how awesome it is I just

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,040
play this little teeny tiny role here

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,950
but I'm part of something bigger and so

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,750
I think that's that's an important thing

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,400
another important thing that

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,800
distributions do is they act like this

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,700
little city of ardmore oklahoma where

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,370
they say we're building an inclusive

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,620
community distributions try to reach out

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,020
to lots of different people i know

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,180
inside a fedora it's it's it's there's

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,220
no end of the debate when we talk about

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,780
well there's people using fedora for

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,190
servers or people that want it just for

00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,410
the desktop there's people that want it

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,780
for design or some people want it for

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,310
electronics design some people want to

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,380
create music with it some people want to

00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,870
create websites with it some people want

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,980
to use fedora in the cloud there's a lot

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,490
of different people with different

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,170
objectives different backgrounds coming

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,030
together in the distribution I think

00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,920
that's a very healthy thing I think if

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,900
everybody in fedoras not exactly like I

00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,360
did the Fedora would be a pretty boring

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,490
distribution and so I think that variety

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,590
really helps out but we want to be

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,660
inclusive as well and it's not just

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,390
about people writing software you know

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,520
in fedora for example we need packagers

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,020
but we need designers we need release

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,150
engineers we need people willing to do

00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,160
translation need people willing to do

00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,160
documentation we need people willing to

00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,300
do marketing and open-source marketing

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,660
is the weird thing we could talk about

00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,890
it and if there's time but we need

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,870
people from all different backgrounds

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,290
all different perspectives to help us

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:14,680
make Fedora better we need to be

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,660
training today the future leaders for

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,370
our distribution tomorrow and I think

00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,600
you know that's the only only way we're

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,220
going to be able to sustain the growth

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,410
the only way we're going to be able to

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,610
continue advancing is not just say it's

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,140
the same ten people that we're working

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,520
on it last year that are working on it

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,430
this year but have those 10 people

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,290
trained 10 more or 20 more and then have

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:36,970
those 20 train 200 and go from there I

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,290
find it interesting if I ask people so

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,660
as I'm going to ask you just for the fun

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:44,950
of it how many people here started

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,480
losing Linux entirely on their own how

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,040
many people here started using Linux

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,080
because a friend or a neighbor or

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,610
relative said hey yeah to check this out

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,299
this is kind of interesting I know

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,919
that's how I got started

00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,179
if I hadn't been for a friend in college

00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:57,649
that says hey I know you're taking this

00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:59,179
unix class but here's this free stuff

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,190
you can download and use all the same

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,809
unix tools you can do all your homework

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,049
on this for free instead i happen to go

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,340
into the lab at school I probably you

00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,350
know I might have found it eventually

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,019
but I certainly wouldn't have gotten got

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,570
started when I did it was really because

00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,850
of a friend that got me started in it

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,169
now again I want to go back to this

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,720
concept it's not just about the

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:22,999
technology it's as much about the

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,269
relationships you know the friends we

00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,830
have the people we talk to as it is just

00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:32,419
the bits and the bytes that make a

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:35,539
distribution the next kind of role that

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:38,600
the software distribution plays is that

00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:41,840
of having a bunch of tools the whole

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,899
reason we use computers is why to get

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,399
stuff done right it's a lot easier to

00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:49,700
get stuff done if you have the right

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:51,200
tools my dad does a lot of woodworking

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,720
and he always taught me as I was growing

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,379
up that having the right tool is half

00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,799
the job right so I think a lot of us

00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:03,919
feel very comfortable with the tools

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,830
that we have in in our preferred

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,450
distribution here's here's a set of

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:12,259
tools for a guy that likes to have great

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,090
electric electric guitars he has all the

00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:16,700
right tools he needs to go upgrade that

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,230
electric guitar think I want you to

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,269
think about your your preferred linux

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,700
distribution what is it about that that

00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,379
you really like and i'll bet you a lot

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,789
of it is it has the tools you need and

00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,909
you're comfortable with the way that

00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:34,909
those the way that those tools are

00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:37,279
represented okay some of the more you

00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:41,149
know touchy feely parts of a linux

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,919
distribution linux distributions again

00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:44,629
tend to be a gathering place but they

00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,820
also tend to be a schoolhouse where

00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:48,649
people can learn new things I'm

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,629
constantly amazed at how many smart

00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:52,100
people hang out my particular

00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:53,840
distribution and how much I can learn

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,070
from them just because I'm the Fedora

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
project leader doesn't mean I'm an

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,330
expert

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,309
that at either Linux or or a fedora

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,600
thank goodness because I never would

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,820
have been qualified for the job if that

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,649
were the case but it's a great

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,000
opportunity for learning there's so much

00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,519
out there and there are so many people

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,220
out there willing to show you how to how

00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,019
to do things that it's really a

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,509
tremendous opportunity from from a

00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:19,649
self-improvement and in growth

00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:21,990
standpoint so so take advantage of those

00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:23,879
opportunities they're out there they're

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,820
available all it takes is a little

00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:28,860
effort I know for myself sometimes it's

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,450
hard to say I get in a rut aha I'm

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,519
perfectly happy with what I know and

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,230
what I'm doing right now it's hard to

00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:35,340
break out of that I got to learn

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,200
something I got to try something

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,519
different let me try a different tool to

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,379
see if it works better than what I'm

00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,080
than what I'm used to and yes every once

00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:44,309
in a while I do try Emacs just to just

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,899
to just to try to break out of that

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:50,250
shell so there's that another thing I

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,889
really really like about linux

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,200
distributions in particular is the

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:57,690
chance for cross-pollination you've got

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,799
so many smart people but smart people

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,019
from different backgrounds with

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,759
different disciplines I think one of the

00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,620
great things about the information age

00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:08,879
and things that we've seen over the last

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:11,179
10 15 20 years is that computers and

00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:14,070
technology have really allowed people to

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,690
be creative in and take an idea from

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,970
here in an idea from here and have the

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:22,620
tools they need to rapidly prototype a

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:24,570
business rapidly prototype a you know

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,769
whatever it is that they happen to be

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,690
working on whether it's a piece of code

00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:31,289
or a website or those sorts of things

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,539
and do some really amazing things not

00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:35,659
because they were impossible to do

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:38,340
before just the tools weren't there I

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:39,840
think you know I look at what's

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,789
happening with cloud computing it's not

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,929
that somebody can't go up go out and buy

00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:45,710
a bunch of servers and build themselves

00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:48,779
a little data center in their office

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,399
we've probably all done that you know

00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,720
cloud computing just makes it easier who

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,220
you don't have to you don't have to be

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,710
an expert at building a data center to

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,149
go out and build a big database you

00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,100
build a big website or build a big

00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:00,480
application you let somebody else worry

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,240
about what they're good at and you focus

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,950
on what what you're good at I love the

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,539
the opportunities that the Linux

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,980
distributions give you two to

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:12,309
cross-pollinate and share ideas with p

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,160
from different backgrounds obviously a

00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:19,150
big portion of what linux distributions

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,440
do deals with communication and you know

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,740
they have tons of mailing lists and

00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:28,360
forums and IRC channels and ways to

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,760
communicate I always wonder though if if

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,120
we're fighting this war a little bit a

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,860
little bit off-center if we're more

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,380
focused on the quantity of the

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,890
communication rather than a quality of

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,020
the communication I think if if open

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,480
source in general has a has a blackout a

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,570
black eye out there in the you know in

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,720
the industry it's probably because of

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,660
this I think you know people in

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,140
open-source tend to be very smart

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,600
sometimes they tend to be very

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,610
opinionated as well I worry sometimes

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,110
about from people who aren't used to the

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,360
open-source way of doing things that

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:09,730
aren't used to people being upfront and

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:12,460
Frank and and direct at times you know I

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,890
wonder I wonder how how we could do a

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:18,549
better job of putting our best foot

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:21,100
forward showing showing the potential we

00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:26,290
have without coming coming off as a

00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:28,150
bunch of yeah you know to put it bluntly

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,580
coming off as a bunch of snotty kids who

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,990
don't shave and and have no social life

00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,179
I hate to put it in size of blunt terms

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,799
but you know sometimes that's that's

00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,510
that's the way we come off so we use you

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,850
know I I encourage you to think about

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:43,210
communication and what are ways that we

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,900
can improve the way that we communicate

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,220
one with another I've certainly tried to

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,750
do that as the Fedora project leader

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,940
I've actually reached out to several of

00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,470
the other Linux distributions to say

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,650
what could what can we do to communicate

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,690
better between the different linux

00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:01,929
distributions we're not all the same we

00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,890
all have our different focuses we all

00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:05,049
have our different strengths and

00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:08,710
weaknesses but we need to improve the

00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:11,799
way we communicate one with another so I

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,480
encourage you to think about that I I

00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,030
can't see that picture very well that's

00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,950
security cameras one of the things I

00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,840
care deeply about in fedora and I hope

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,620
other Linux distributions do as well is

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,640
being open and

00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:28,030
transparent as possible you know none

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,260
none of us lives in isolation we're all

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,090
communicating with one of their we're

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,280
sharing with one another and I think

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,720
it's very very important for a for linux

00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,700
distribution is to be as open and

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,200
transparent as possible in the way that

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,020
not only in the way that the software

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,480
gets built and put together but the kind

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,520
of the decisions the bureaucracy of the

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,250
politics that goes into putting a

00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,350
distribution together that's something

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,360
I've pushed very very hard for in fedora

00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,280
making sure that if we are if we're

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,540
going to have a meeting either the

00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,059
meetings going to be out in the open and

00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,559
and you know there's going to be logs

00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,870
available so the people can see what

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,160
we're what we're doing or if there's a

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,360
reason we can't do it in public we're

00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,920
going to tell people this is why we're

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,740
meeting in private and this is this is

00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,620
why we can't share it luckily we have

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,660
very view very few reasons not to have

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,660
our meetings in public so that people

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,670
can know what's what's going on but I

00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,990
think that's that that helps build trust

00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,730
again going back to the kind of the

00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,860
human side of things it's not just about

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,240
putting packages on a CD and shipping

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,880
them out it's really about building

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,190
these relationships of trust between the

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,600
core people that are helping to to build

00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:37,190
that distribution because that's the

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,780
sustainable model we shouldn't have you

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,309
know we should be so open and

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,050
transparent and everything we do that we

00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:44,050
don't leave room for misunderstanding

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:51,110
obviously linux distributions and in DNA

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,730
in any technical forum in general give

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:58,130
people a chance to stand up on their

00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:01,730
soapbox and shout you know sometimes

00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:05,480
that's a good thing sometimes that's not

00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:10,210
such a good thing can't tell what that

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,040
is the meat grinder you know open source

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,140
the the free software development model

00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,360
is not the most efficient way to get

00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,920
things done just happens to be the only

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,980
one that works over the long term you

00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,540
know and sometimes it's ugly sometimes

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,660
it's like watching sausage being made

00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:29,240
its it's not a pretty thing but it works

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,120
and I think you know I think if you look

00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,090
at software development in general

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,040
it's a model that's sustainable so we

00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,810
don't expect things to be perfect in a

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,600
version 1 hour version 2 or maybe even

00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:44,940
version 3 we're really a work in

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,220
progress we have things that we're

00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,930
striving for we know that we're going to

00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,070
part way there with this release and

00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,080
then we're going to another release and

00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,220
it's a little further for that gets us a

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,390
little further down the road and we're

00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,730
going to you know we're gonna have to

00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,260
adjust where we go from time to time but

00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,520
it's about continual improvement we're

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:05,820
going to be better tomorrow than we were

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:08,280
today now people often you know ask me

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,180
as the Fedora project leader what's what

00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,190
is it that I worry most about you know

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,800
who's our enemy who am I really worried

00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,260
about out there if you were to ask me

00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,420
you know ten years ago who i thought the

00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,370
enemy of free and open source software

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,080
was i probably would have said how some

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,330
large evil corporation it's going to

00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,250
come squash us all and take away our

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:34,140
software if you would have asked me

00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,610
maybe five years ago I probably have

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,250
said all that other that other Linux

00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,220
distribution yeah they're our enemy

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,900
they're the ones were fighting against

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:46,020
if you ask me today well I think the

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:50,550
enemy is I would say we found the enemy

00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:53,550
and he is us I think you know speaky

00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:56,250
speaking my own my own private opinion

00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,560
here I think Fedora's biggest enemy

00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:01,650
right now is fedora there's within

00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,350
fedora I think the biggest I think the

00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:07,460
biggest battles we as humans fight are

00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:12,960
within the within our coconuts up here

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:16,169
and I'm more worried about how we treat

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,540
the people inside our own group that I

00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:20,010
am necessarily about some large evil

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,370
corporation or some of us some other

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,929
Linux distribution that's that's what

00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:28,860
that's what concerns me and I you know

00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:31,890
if you're a member of fedora please take

00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,060
this as an opportunity to reflect on how

00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,340
we treat each other inside of the door

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,840
if you're a member of another linux

00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,310
distribution or several other linux

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,169
distribution think about how you

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,630
communicate one with another how you

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:44,280
treat each other if we're all in this

00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,119
together how are we going to going to go

00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,149
out and

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:52,409
grow and conquer the glass that are out

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:53,909
there if we can't take care of her on so

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:56,849
I throw that out there for thought I

00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:58,970
think too many times we throw up

00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,099
barriers that don't need to be there

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,990
it's hard enough to learn Linux it's

00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,200
hard enough to learn the open-source

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:09,269
methodology it's hard enough to

00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,240
understand philosophically what does it

00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:13,769
mean to be free software we don't need

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,880
to throw up barriers in people's way to

00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:20,069
make that harder than it needs to be and

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,230
I could I could tell lots of examples I

00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:24,630
could tell lots of examples from my from

00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,359
my own life when I first got started in

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,249
voice over IP with the asterisk project

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,049
you know I saw that there was this cool

00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:32,970
voice over IP project on the internet

00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:34,740
and it sounded interesting and I had

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,349
some free time so I tried to dive into

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,339
it and I started asking around hey can

00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,950
somebody give me hand is there

00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:42,990
documentation and somebody in an IRC

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,279
channel says ah if you're not smart

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:46,170
enough to just go and read the source

00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:49,650
code and figure it out we don't want you

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:51,119
here now I know a lot of people you know

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,930
what a balk defense are on I don't want

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,339
to be there if that's the attitude

00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,489
people have I took that as a challenge

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:58,739
and ended up getting into it but I think

00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,970
too many times we throw up those those

00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,920
barriers oh you don't know how to use

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,390
viu you don't need to be here you don't

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,430
need you don't know you don't use Emacs

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,720
you don't need to be here you can't you

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,279
can't figure out how to find that in the

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,779
man page you don't need to be here I

00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:12,390
think we throw up these artificial

00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:14,489
barriers in people's way to try to keep

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:17,579
them out it's not about keeping people

00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:19,230
out if if if I teach ten other people

00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,489
how to use this software that doesn't

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,660
mean there's less for me it's not a

00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:26,400
zero-sum game you know I can't tell you

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,309
how many people I've introduced to linux

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,749
and five years down the road I'm going

00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:32,039
to them saying hey can you help me you

00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:33,630
understand this much better than I ever

00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,160
learned it can you can you show me how

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,470
to do this this particular thing it's

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,549
not a zero-sum game so we need to you

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,460
know have as many people as possible

00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:42,779
helping us out we need to do whatever we

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,839
can to tear down these artificial

00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:48,869
barriers to keep people from being able

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,099
to progress obviously there's lots of

00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:51,839
different things we can tweak there's

00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,150
lots of different knobs we can tweak now

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,480
anybody here in to audio have any up

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,070
audio files in the room

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,119
what if you had a nice mixer like that

00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,240
and I came up to it says oh that's

00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:06,540
interesting changed about 20 or 30 knobs

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,640
all at once what make you happy with it

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,540
but that's what we do is geeks we want

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,210
to go twist all the knobs right of

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:18,840
course so how do we how do we get past

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,820
that one of the things that's one of the

00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,830
things I had to learn very very early on

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,109
as the Fedora project leader is let's be

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,000
very measured let's be very deliberate

00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,200
and yes we're going to tweak some knobs

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,250
but we're going to turn them one at a

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,510
time and then we're going to wait for

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,710
some feedback and then we're going to

00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,330
turn another one and we're going to wait

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,820
for some feedback we can't be doing this

00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,280
all day or we'll never find the right

00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,640
answer there's just too many variables

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,780
in at all last but not least here I

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:50,100
think the most important thing that

00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:54,810
linux distributions need to do is use

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:57,240
their ears and listen I think a lot of

00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,700
us spend a lot of our time talking and

00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,500
sometimes not so much listening I think

00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:06,690
there's a there's a good reason that the

00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:10,650
Lord gave me one mouth into two ears and

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:12,780
I I certainly you know we need to listen

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:17,220
more and I think in general an open

00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:21,540
source we need to listen more not only

00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:24,630
to listen to complaints but to listen to

00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,830
praise as well I think sometimes in open

00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,020
source communities maybe we're a little

00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,760
selfish I think some of us get this this

00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,050
attitude of oh I'm entitled to this

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,890
because it's out there and I can do it

00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:37,260
and I can express my opinion and we

00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,180
don't ever think to say thank you when

00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,950
something works well we'll go file a bug

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,470
report or complain on a mailing list if

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,940
something's broken but how many times do

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,440
we take the time to say you know what I

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,200
used your piece of software and it just

00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,880
worked thank you or hey I read this

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,270
documentation you wrote and it helped me

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,090
get past this hurdle ahead thank you so

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,859
it's it's it's listening and then and

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,520
then giving people appropriate feedback

00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:04,920
as you as you find those sorts of things

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,290
and I guess you might ask the ask the

00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,080
question well why why go to all this

00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,740
extra effort why go go to the extra

00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,380
effort to

00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,780
to try to swim against the current why

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,210
try to go to all that extra effort to be

00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,680
careful about the way we communicate why

00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,380
go to all that extra effort to try to

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,260
mentor other people in what we're doing

00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:30,540
why go to all that extra effort to walk

00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:33,420
that extra mile why because we all live

00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,150
downstream just like you wouldn't want

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,830
your neighbor poor and motor oil down

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,830
the rain you know that down the gutter

00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:45,900
we all live downstream right we're all

00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,000
end users of this very software that

00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,980
we're trying to make better and so

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,540
that's why it that's why it's worth it

00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,420
that's why we have to take that back

00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,369
concerted effort to swim against the

00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,940
current to do to do the things that are

00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:04,230
right you know anything that's

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,330
worthwhile is going to be difficult it's

00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,180
not easy to do these things but it's the

00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,220
only way forward so I share that's

00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:14,490
that's my vision of what linux

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:17,550
distributions need to do and should be

00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:20,820
doing and in in most cases are doing to

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:24,030
make upstream community stronger now I

00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,590
don't have all the answers in fact that

00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,260
you guys you guys in this room we're

00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,850
probably ten times smarter than I am but

00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,619
I want you to think about those sorts of

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,840
things and I'm happy to answer questions

00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:37,230
if people have questions that i can

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,940
answer but more importantly i think i

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,670
invite you to go out and ask questions

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,420
of other people and say look what can

00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:47,850
you learn from for other people but

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,260
we've got a few minutes here open it up

00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,090
for questions and answers either either

00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,180
on the topic of open source

00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,590
distributions on on fedora in general if

00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,200
you want questions about voice over IP

00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:01,080
you know i'm happy to answer questions

00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:04,400
about VI or xml or technical

00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,400
documentation or you know

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:24,260
exactly so questions so the so the

00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,370
question is this slide I had earlier let

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,810
me see if I can find it here where I

00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:30,020
said the inner that really the enemy is

00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,820
us was that a real the realization I had

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,080
after becoming the the Fedora project

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,180
leader or was that something that I

00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,780
thought that I found out afterward no it

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,490
was something I knew full well from my

00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,100
many years in fedora before I became the

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,870
Fedora project leader and I don't think

00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,460
that's anything that's that's you know

00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,170
special about fedora I saw the same

00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,420
thing an asterisk and voice over IP I

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,600
saw that same thing in you know many of

00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,700
the other open source communities that I

00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,590
that I deal with but ya know to answer

00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,390
your question I walked into the job with

00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:05,480
my eyes wide open knowing knowing what

00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:07,250
was involved there we read the manual

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,630
even if it's even if it doesn't exist

00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,730
even if it's out of date even if it's

00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:12,920
not quite right yeah because that's the

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,830
easy answer right that's that's the I'm

00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,930
too busy you know don't don't don't

00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,750
bother me and we've got to get past that

00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,750
we've got to we've got to find a way to

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,750
do

00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:52,729
and that's why you that's why it's like

00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:55,999
you said the first two guys are trying

00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:58,069
to the next twenty because we do we

00:42:55,999 --> 00:43:00,769
everyone everyone in all these open

00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:02,869
sores everyone you're the only salary in

00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:05,269
fedora I mean all these people are

00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:07,640
volunteering their time to generate this

00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:09,199
massive product I'm not the only salary

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:30,140
there's there's a few of us yes there's

00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:32,539
a that's and I'll be honest mentorship

00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,699
is very very hard and there was a there

00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:36,589
was an interesting article i wish i had

00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:40,369
the link right here that came out on the

00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:42,079
past week or so trying to take who who

00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,279
it was that wrote it behave way they

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,809
were talking about mentorship and

00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:47,329
particularly in mentorship and open

00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:48,799
source communities and about sixty to

00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:52,069
seventy eighty percent of the time it

00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:53,449
fails so with with you know with those

00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:56,059
kind of efforts you may have to mentor

00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:57,439
five different people before you get

00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:00,319
that one that actually catches on and

00:43:57,439 --> 00:44:03,079
gets it and can continue on where you

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,150
left off its and they're all getting to

00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,589
word emails too so it's it's a very hard

00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,689
problem solve that being said it's

00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:11,059
absolutely worth it and where you see it

00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:12,799
that works it works well is absolutely

00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:15,199
beautiful thing to see have people catch

00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:17,299
that vision say aha I finally see what

00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,279
you're seeing now I want to go do it and

00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:20,809
catch that excitement and we've all seen

00:44:19,279 --> 00:44:22,249
it right you've seen that the person

00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:24,170
that comes in I'm really excited to do

00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:25,279
something oh now I don't fit in and I

00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,069
don't know what I'm doing and I'm

00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:30,289
treading water and then they catch that

00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:32,619
vision like I get it now I know how to

00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:32,619
swim

00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:27,059
yes how else do i respond to that but no

00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:30,230
I think I think that's I think that's a

00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,230
great analogy you know I think

00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:23,530
what I don't and I think we all have a

00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:24,789
sum certain level of confirmation bias

00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,380
build into our lives these days because

00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:28,089
we listen to music we want to listen to

00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,829
we read the mailing lists that we want

00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:32,319
to read to we subscribe to the RSS feeds

00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:33,940
that we want to read and so we have

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,280
enough of this tailor-made for how we

00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,289
are I think that's a great a great thing

00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,299
that we need to work on is listen to

00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:41,710
people who have different opinions than

00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:43,510
what we have try to reach out to

00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,799
somebody who's different and try to see

00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,900
things from their point of view and I

00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:49,079
think I think that would serve us all

00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,079
well

00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:51,530
you've been doing it for so long you

00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,040
don't realize you have to explain that

00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,040
step

00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,150
there's no one right answer there's no

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,270
easy way to solve that problem and I

00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:56,000
think more than maybe more than than

00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:58,520
saying that mentorship is a hard effort

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,800
or documentation is an effort I think

00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,569
they're a mindset I think if you have a

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,390
mindset of being a mentor if you have a

00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:08,420
mindset of that documentation is

00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:10,309
important and repeatability is important

00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,020
that you're going to do those things as

00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:14,180
you're doing your or your everyday work

00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,530
that help make it easier to document

00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,910
things that help make it easier to do

00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:19,490
mentorship is yes it still requires

00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,589
effort but having the mindset Aston town

00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,609
has to be there first you're never going

00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:24,079
to take the effort and feel good about

00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:25,609
the effort if you don't have the mindset

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,250
that that's important to begin with

00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:33,859
otherwise it's just a drudgery nobody

00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:35,990
likes a drudgery it doesn't have to be

00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:37,490
I've participated in documentation xin

00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,099
severed in several different groups in

00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:43,780
fedora an asterisk and several other

00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:43,780
communities were it's been fun

00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:17,150
yep and that's another thing with

00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:19,700
mentorship as you're teaching someone

00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:21,200
knew how to do something watch for the

00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,130
places where they fall down or the fail

00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,200
and that's where you need better

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,210
documentation and so it doesn't it

00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,940
doesn't have to be you oh I'm an expert

00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:30,770
now now I can go to the jury of writing

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,420
the documentation down it should be part

00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,430
of that exploration phase when you're

00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,130
learning something new that down some

00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:39,350
notes somebody we can help and it

00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,690
doesn't have to be formal you know 12

00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,040
paragraphs you know long explanations

00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,160
you know we have things like wiki's and

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,210
things like that make it very easy to

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,619
start out small and have other people

00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,619
collaborating help make it better

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:21,170
people in fedora specifically in certain

00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:25,040
parts we do have you no formal mentoring

00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:26,839
processes like becoming a software

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,180
package or in fedora or becoming an

00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:31,369
ambassador in fedora we tend to have a

00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:44,599
fairly good structured you know

00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:47,780
onboarding process is there but some it

00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:49,520
is difficult it is hard to get through

00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,260
especially for somebody who are if

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,220
you're not sitting there face-to-face

00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:55,579
with them if you're trying to interact

00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:57,880
with them over email or or IRC it's it's

00:51:55,579 --> 00:52:00,049
much harder to do I wish there was a a

00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,720
simple solution to that one thing I

00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:04,579
found I was at one of our food con

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,170
conferences in Panama a couple of weeks

00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,339
ago and I found though we had a hackfest

00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,869
session there where we just SAT people

00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:10,579
down and said anybody who started

00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:12,380
through the packaging process but never

00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:14,180
got sponsored because they didn't finish

00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,349
this up we're going to have people here

00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,890
that can answer your questions and help

00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:21,380
you get squared away right here you know

00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,730
and having places where people can come

00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,380
in person and do those sorts of things

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,109
seems to help a lot more than just

00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:30,380
trying to add more process to it over

00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:32,710
email or IRC your tickets through those

00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,710
sorts of things

00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:43,720
oh that's what you meant like this like

00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:46,690
you know then just change it right away

00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:55,390
always telling people it's a week I

00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:56,560
don't care if it's your first day and I

00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,880
think that's you know I think that goes

00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,950
down I'm just about out of time but I

00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,110
think that goes to the rip what really

00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:03,370
is the open source way and that is if

00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,500
you want something done you either

00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:07,330
scratch your own itch you convince

00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,860
somebody else to scratch your itch for

00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,530
you or you convince somebody else that

00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:15,100
it really is there H and get them to to

00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:17,320
do it but but that's what it is and so

00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,520
things like documentation encouraging

00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,690
people to say hey go scratch your own

00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,180
itch if thats in this doesn't seem right

00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,770
to you you've got the power be bold you

00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,810
know we can always revert it later we've

00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,490
got a history you know go change that

00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:30,430
encouraging people to be bold and not

00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:32,080
Tim that as they as they join a you know

00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,130
trying to try something new is also you

00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,960
know an important part of that as well

00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,580
it's not just as is the mentors that

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,440
that need to do all the work people

00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,870
joining the joining in and trying

00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,970
something new need to know you know we

00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:45,580
got backups and stuff be bold go try

00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,470
something to be okay with failure accept

00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,990
failure failure is how we grow failure

00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,130
is how we learn anyway I'm out of time

00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,600

you

00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:49,650
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,210
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,160
cloud is just the next generation of

00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,109
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,090
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:58,260
we're in a unique position to really

00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,359
help bring these two worlds together

00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,700
these different sets of technologies and

00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:05,040
to help companies embrace this new world

00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,050
in this great new tool that allows

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,630
faster innovation not only is it about

00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:14,640
us being responsive and accountable but

00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:17,400
it's about us doing more for you whether
