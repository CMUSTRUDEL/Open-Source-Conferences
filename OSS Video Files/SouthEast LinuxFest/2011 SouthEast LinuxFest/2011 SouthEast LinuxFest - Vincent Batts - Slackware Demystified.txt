www.ccltss.org the south east linux fest

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,519
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,990
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,850
as you probably all know this is Vincent

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,680
bats Vincent is a developer on the

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,120
course Slackware Linux team and a

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,430
software developer for Akamai

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,410
Technologies he is the open source

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,200
advocate in both the commercial arena as

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:57,899
well as the community for Slackware and

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:59,940
a mindful geek thank you thank you so

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,820
Slackware demystified and I thought this

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,949
would be an interesting talk since I'm

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,270
one of the newest guy newest folks on

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:13,710
the core team or whatever of Slackware

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,259
and sure enough as soon as I would say

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,850
that I'm putting myself up for this it

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,850
just gets a little bit more intense so

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:28,409
so I'm Vincent bats this is the talk if

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,240
you see me anywhere on the Internet you

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,350
can pretty much Google for V bats that's

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,950
me

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,909
IRC handles emails whatever so a little

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,130
bit of what the talks about bullet

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,000
points this is an overview I'll hit some

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,040
smidgens some philosophy of it there's

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,240
it's it's funny when you go through and

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,530
actually start putting together a talk

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,060
like this because you start realizing

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,689
the emptiness and pull it all is

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,909
actually there so when you think I will

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,500
give a talk on this thing it's usually

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,100
to say there's not really anything there

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,140
tada it's magic so first awesome

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,289
smidgens to the to the community at

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,480
large

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:15,879
thank all y'all because I was originally

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,129
intended to be an accountant in the

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,920
world so that's my education that was my

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:23,680
slant in life and it has not been at all

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,720
where I've gone and I completely blame

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,989
the open source Linux community for that

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,349
because people like you write stuff and

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,849
put out good documentation and let other

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,370
hungry geeks figure out what they want

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:40,299
to do with it so thank you thank you

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:44,560
thank you love love love hugs but then

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:47,319
secondly to Slackware Linux a team

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,540
Volker ding who made a special guest

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,319
appearance if anybody has not recognized

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,390
this yet

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,200
we have Pat Volker ting in the room the

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,200
founder of Slackware Linux

00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,230
so if Volker dings in the room and then

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,000
the rest of the team that's considered

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,720
the core group of folks as alien Bob

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,239
Eric Hamel is it's in the Netherlands

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,430
Robby workman who is around this weekend

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,380
Allen Hicks who just talked a few

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,510
minutes ago

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,829
fred peter punk alpha geek you might see

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,180
some of these names around from time to

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:32,170
time but all of them are involved some

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,400
hard - all of them uh you iconic Lee you

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:39,819
know what the name of that you know the

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,590
name of that images lemonparty so first

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,970
off I'll get it get the party started

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,180
with a little bit of trivia

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,069
during this last release cycle of

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,620
slacker 1337 it was released about a

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:53,319
month or so ago one of our RC candidates

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:58,510
and about five or six RC candidates that

00:03:53,319 --> 00:04:00,130
happened yeah was PI a Slackware beer

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,849
bottle opener for anybody who can tell

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,930
me why it was PI No

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:10,830
anybody anybody I'll leave it standing

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,180
oh this is a good one too y'all

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,530
y'all should Google around and try and

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,889
figure out that one so this is this is

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,299
staying for whoever can come up with do

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,660
what it we have we had we had a one of

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:28,350
them

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:33,510
it was 3.14 to a large number that's

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:37,580
pretty deep but no well that was that 37

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,580
just about coincidence I think yes sir

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,500
know that the the pirate pirate being

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,280
the version of the RC the kernel version

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:55,940
was dot 37 which was coincidentally 1337

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,940
also yes there was a lot of that but no

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,080
it was mildly elite so there is there's

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,310
a there's a particular answer I'm

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,669
looking for so if y'all want to Google

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,020
for that I wouldn't blame you so second

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:09,900
little trivia and this one might be a

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:15,720
little easier for folks who knows who

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:19,200
the the gas smoking the pipe I'll just

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,900
chunk this in mixed you yeah and then

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:30,300
somebody else ever here got it so what's

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:31,800
up dude okay sorry alright so who all in

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,650
the room has run Linux I mean it's like

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,740
a relaxed yeah ever front it not just

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,620
like like this is my primary desktop

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,560
who's played with Slackware Linux number

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,840
of hands most of the hands so Slackware

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,940
Linux this is this is usually like

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,630
people think ooh slacker you know it's

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,810
old

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,240
it looks like Doss it's you know it's

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,639
clearly stable because it must be old

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,500
and that's what stable is and then a lot

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,919
of people think it's like cultist like

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,020
slack you know it's not really it's it's

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,639
just kind of a funny name and it's stuck

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:13,789
around and it's clever

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:18,270
but so Who am I Who am I I'm Ivette so

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:20,160
I'm a shade free Linux nerd again

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,280
brother was preceded me about 10 years

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,590
and he handed a open source Linux disk

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,930
to a 13 year old and said hey here's

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,650
this thing called Linux and that was a

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,140
bad start

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:35,160
so anything else that I might have been

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,960
destined to do in life was runt and so

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,330
since then life has been life and I've

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,330
tinkered around but there's actually

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,310
playing with KDE and amongst other

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,440
things that led me into being a part of

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,290
the slacker team in about the summer of

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,810
2009 so since then my primary

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,870
distractions are Ruby and KDE and Ruby

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,120
whether you love it or hate it I do too

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,520
so if you ever have any questions on

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,370
those two things feel free to hit me up

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,470
as a day job I'm now a software

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,090
developer or whatever at a comma

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,950
technologies if you're not familiar with

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,400
Akamai we make the internet go very fast

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:14,130
and efficient and we are hiring so feel

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,300
free to hit up that URL or come talk to

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,010
me if you want to know what it is like

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,400
to work at Akamai it's a really fun

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:23,930
place so this is my contact Vee bats at

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,520
any one of those domains you'll find me

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,040
if any point I'm talking too fast

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,440
because I do that sometime tell me to

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:37,050
chill out because I'll get speedy so

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:42,540
philosophy could only be preceded by the

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:46,190
philosoraptor so the majority of the

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,190
philosophy is just to keep it simple

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:55,340
Slackware Linux as a operating system is

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:59,190
holds very true to two notions primarily

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,500
to stay as close to a UNIX environment

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,870
as possible you know no bells no

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,330
whistles is what the software that makes

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,210
up the second part of it a distribution

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,710
is typically a collection just you know

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,160
all the different components that are

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,240
the upstream from the community put

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,890
those all into one nice little pretty

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,980
place the entire ribbon around it that

00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:23,460
thin ribbon is what you'd call slack

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,500
we're so to say that you use slackers

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,680
effectively effectively to say you've

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,140
used the components comprised in that

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,980
slack work which for most Linux

00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,910
distributions is the

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,720
same stuff you're familiar with

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:39,630
elsewhere so the other thing that a lot

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,640
of people don't find and either they

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,250
really really like it or they really

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,580
really don't like is the fact that there

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,560
is no kind of hey let me help you with

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,240
that like some kind of helper script or

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,920
something to automatically automatically

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,380
do something there's there's none of

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,030
that if you want to know how to make

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,460
something do that thing go read that

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,620
thing's documentation so it's not just

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,780
gonna automatically pop up and say hey

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,640
you've got new updates available you

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,390
need to do this no it's the system

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,330
admins position so stick with upstream

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,610
if you've ever built anything from

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,770
source I mean there's a lot of

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,410
variations on this now but this is

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,610
essentially like you can if you're

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,000
familiar with this process you're

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,740
familiar with most of what's going on

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,620
obviously not like sudo make install to

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,820
just blow it across the system but

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,220
essentially this is this will get you

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,330
used to whatever this is doing from

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,400
whatever sort of software you're

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,550
interested in you go download some

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,590
component whatever that does it's what

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,680
you will should expect to find on your

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:49,310
filesystem not some obfuscated process

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,510
so the other nice part about it is that

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,620
sometimes when you get into researching

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,890
how something happened what what what

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,630
all is involved in what just happened

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,240
the helper scripts that are also in the

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,010
base installation are of what if you

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,950
would call the operating system of slack

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,320
where it's all shell scripts so either

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,630
your startup scripts or your package

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,530
management utilities other than that

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:20,670
it's upstream so if really you had any

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,260
true honest-to-god bug reports it might

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,330
be the version of something like is

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,760
using outdated or security vulnerability

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,820
but otherwise it bugs would be of these

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,650
things so there's no real bugs that

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,660
would go directly to slack where it's

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:38,340
it's minimal so again no magic it's it's

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,180
shell scripts they might look really

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:47,370
cool but their shell scripts so

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:50,070
as a user as a hacker as a tinkerer as a

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:54,420
research person I think the biggest

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,920
thing that most people would have to

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,330
find themselves you know have to

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,110
discover and go into what it is like how

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:06,240
do I as a user or whatever your role is

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:09,060
work with slacker is literally learning

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,470
how to learn because it might be man

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,060
pages like if you're really getting down

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,320
and dirty with the command line that

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,080
that's what you need to learn how to do

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,209
if it's learning how to contribute back

00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,040
with another project find out how they

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:23,010
want to do their processes like writing

00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,110
or compiling or documenting KDE

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:31,470
who knows what you'd learn about that

00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:33,990
process and in this you you can learn

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,690
what to ask as a bug I hey I think I

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,300
found something broken whatever it is

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,290
it's all a learning process and it's not

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,480
ever saying hey I learned that one

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,330
nugget that one Jim that solved all my

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,250
problems if you were to say that it

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,260
would be the process of learning because

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,790
everything is constantly evolving

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,339
whatever we take from upstream there's

00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:00,620
something new and different about it and

00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:04,350
this is not just this is this slide it's

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,510
except for maybe the the reporting again

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,190
stocks like where this slide could be

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,690
true of anything learn how to ask an

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,120
educated question you'll get a lot more

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,160
help from the community that way if you

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,920
walk out anywhere saying hey it's broken

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,170
I need somebody to help me fix it you

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,930
need to come in with saying I've already

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,010
tried this I've already read this

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:29,970
learning how to learn and learning how

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:32,459
to ask questions so as far as the actual

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,880
services Slackware sticks to the

00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,480
Sisyphean model a very small and it

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,640
binary that kicks off and runs runs a

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,050
series of scripts depending or commands

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,550
depending on what run level you

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:49,470
specified it's driving through next

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,670
trivia who knows what default run level

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,740
slack razón

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:57,149
Bravo's say it it's it's row level three

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,240
it's varies from distribution to

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:02,430
distribution some some distributions now

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,500
have trimmed that down to where there's

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,070
not effectively any other addition any

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:13,040
other runlevels besides like multi-level

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:18,660
t user x or a command line root console

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,760
this this is a varied thing now so in

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,000
Etsy and it tab which is where and it

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,610
looks when it boots you have single user

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,950
mode which is not like some fancy

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,529
recovery console to ask you hey what do

00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,480
you want to do this is like no services

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:36,480
are running and you're asked for

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,890
credentials and anybody can log in at

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,540
that point but presumably routes going

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,320
to login because you're not going to be

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,890
remoting into the box nothing else three

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,190
is default two and five both gets you to

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,290
the same type spaces is run level three

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,120
and then a lot of people would won't run

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,640
level four because it boots straight

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,910
into KDE or if you've got gdm it'll do

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:03,330
gdm or if you want to kick it back to

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,940
XDM you can do that to that change you

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:10,500
can make in init tab or you could pass

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:14,490
Lalo Lalo some boot flags but that's

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,250
where they it's setup so then once that

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,700
kicks off these scripts like if you just

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,470
went in LS to that top line you'd see a

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,480
lot more than this but these are the

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,660
primary commands that would be on the

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,850
slack like a stock installation and a

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,510
brief synopsis of what they do so if you

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,339
ever wanted to know or walk through the

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,930
process wonderful I something started

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,730
before or after something else

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,320
what kind of algorithms were used to

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,450
determine why this started after

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,640
something else it's not because they

00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,040
were like thrown into a file folder with

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,770
numbers and something else it's a very

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,940
linear process for starting it up you

00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,640
know getting the system ready and then

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,300
kicking off services as they need to be

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,800
so you can again these are flat files

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,540
feel free to go walk through these

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,100
things and read about them learn about

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:09,050
them so local startups you'll also find

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,050
in that directory and RC local

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,660
beer holder - another local that is in

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,279
that folder that you can run it's not in

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,600
that folder another local that can be

00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:32,319
created - to run anybody another RC

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:34,509
local what anybody else

00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:36,279
another RC local and this actually

00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,199
exists on other distributions but it's

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:41,199
it's as far that's not present that's

00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:44,430
helpful when when added goodness

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:50,499
gracious yep

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:52,870
an underscore shutdown so just like if

00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:54,730
you ever have files that you know

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,790
install some kind of startup script like

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:02,949
VirtualBox or post grip or some some

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,829
other kind of um post post post fix you

00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:07,540
would stick it in RC local

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,759
RC locals provided its there by default

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,829
but if you wanted to create an RC local

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,019
shutdown you could also have things to

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:16,540
do that are kicked off before the system

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:19,199
shuts back down whatever kind of Damon's

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,240
clean up some Damon's do not handle

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,550
having their legs yanked out from

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,829
underneath them they need instructions

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,990
to say hey system shutting down stop me

00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:30,990
you could do that in RC local shutdown

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,939
yes heartbeat is one of those alan hicks

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,259
just gave a talk on heartbeat right next

00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:39,639
door and heartbeat is definitely one of

00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:41,459
those that will have blood and guts if

00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,930
you pull its legs out from underneath it

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:46,990
and you very likely might shoot the

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,339
other node and they just because if you

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,839
didn't if you didn't tell heart leaders

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:53,319
going down then you have multiple

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,670
machines drop offline so the gist of

00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:58,540
these files are pretty straightforward

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,750
but it says is the startup script you're

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,179
looking at is it executable or so run it

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,620
or something like mode program drivers

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:10,770
in that don't get all too loaded or you

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:14,890
want to make sure they whatever so

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:19,689
upstream configurations there there's no

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:21,370
kind of configuration abstraction that's

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:23,199
shimmed into place the

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,230
goes through and says oh you want to use

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,600
my sequel or whatever you come over to

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,790
this file over here and set where you

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,520
know some parameters or whatever boot

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,490
parameters or whatever it is and this

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,130
other thing in the actual scripts that

00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,130
the up stream is using are just

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,950
auto-generated configurations from this

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,290
there's none of that there's lots of

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,090
benefits in understand why lots of

00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,510
enterprising products want to do that

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:56,559
and they have one place one unified view

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:58,030
but again that's if all web streams had

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,940
written it to do that way this was like

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,070
consensus then that's what we would get

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,530
but we do what the upstream has

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,460
designated so if when compiling it

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,929
something like sis Kampf der Etsy and

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,080
then wherever it blows stuff into Etsy

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,820
that's where those files will be so if

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,220
you want to know how to configure some

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:24,330
product go consult them they will tell

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:26,679
you what I should do other than that

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,230
these comp files you'll find in the

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,850
startup directory though that's about

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,210
the extent of some of the configurations

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,220
that you're going to find that are yes

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,390
like we're specific like Etsy and knit

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,980
one it allows you to set up multiple

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,030
interfaces whether you want um DHCP

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,590
hostname presented and whatever else so

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,990
what's the bootloader this would be easy

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:56,320
for a lot of people okay Lalo here's a

00:18:49,990 --> 00:19:00,100
bit here said that there you go I don't

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,340
so Lalo it's old it's like this this is

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,170
one of the oldest and it's under

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:10,230
maintained but it still works and it's

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,230
secure enough main pages are out there

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,460
Lalo is I think some people are

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,140
fundamentally when they come to their

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,700
first relationship or encounter with

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,940
Lalo since so many people have moved to

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:26,350
grub the separation of the fact that

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:28,540
grub menu list is queried upon boot time

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,400
so you could you know boot into rescue

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,700
and change something in grub menu list

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,110
or wherever else that is no and then

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,590
immediately reboot and the

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,200
buuut would just resource that foul Milo

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:44,350
is actually compiled and inserted into

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,549
the Master Boot Record so if you messed

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,740
up and forgot to tell it where the

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:49,660
colonel was you would have to you know

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,420
reboot into something else

00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,630
sure root on the top of that or by some

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,480
means use lie low to install that

00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:01,450
configuration file telling it where that

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,850
colonel is I think this terrifies some

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,900
people but as well it should I mean it's

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,610
kind of a security thing you're not

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,299
leaving yourself an easy backdoor you're

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:13,000
it's it's all built in but it's tried

00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:18,790
and true and it's very na it works with

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,130
all kinds of OpenBSD FreeBSD Windows all

00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,870
kinds of Linux is you can have multi

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,549
stage hard drive so the first one has

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,470
Lalo and then it has off to a certain

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:30,549
partition and that partition has grub

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:33,040
and away it goes it's fine and good and

00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:36,850
all that and then as far as the other

00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,490
boot loader type configurations a lot of

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,370
folks have worked on it but alien Bob is

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:45,010
main culprit for the our MK and it Rd to

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,290
make your an it Ram disk and it's got a

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,080
configuration file that you can use to

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:52,750
generate your init Ram disk if you have

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,330
LVM encryption raid whatever else that

00:20:52,750 --> 00:21:01,740
the kernel needs some instruction with

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:06,250
on booting you can find those there so

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:09,940
as far as a operating system type and

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:12,929
not processing that I'd terms of a pit

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,760
but processes in terms of like

00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:19,570
efficiency process like documentation

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,340
how do you do something when anything

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,929
whenever you go through the process of

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,150
building a package or most of the

00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,370
packages are like in stocks like where

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,400
if it's a configuration file that would

00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,620
land on Etsy and sometimes other places

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,059
it'll be with a dot new if it has

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,419
anything that you might have tweaked

00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:41,559
like httpd you've changed something in

00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:42,669
your httpd Apache configuration next

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:47,810
time you install it you don't want it

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:50,500
clobbered this is 101 so

00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,880
the files are installed as a dot new

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,370
check to see if it's the same file if it

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,830
is it chunks health and doing because no

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,260
need to keep it around some of them will

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:06,770
put it you know allow you to override it

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:09,440
and put it to a backup slight PKG peter

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,140
punk from brazil wrote and maintains

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,010
this this utility and it's the most

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,200
automated part of the package management

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,810
system it allows you to have a

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,940
repository pull and see if you have

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,770
updates install any new packages or

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,800
clean your system back to a stock

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:31,390
installation very nice little automated

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,880
automated tool also all written in shell

00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,160
this particular command if you've

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,470
installed anything by hand or whatever

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,420
else you can run this and it will

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:46,040
iterate over Etsy and say I've got a

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,010
existing file and a dot new of the same

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,600
file do you want me to overwrite delete

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,180
this file do you want to see a dip of

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,250
what it is you know it allows you to one

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,080
for one walk through so you might have

00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,490
new changes you need to pull in or you

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,120
might just want to completely stick with

00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:04,700
what you have effectively you could walk

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,550
through this and do a fine new of your

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:12,530
Etsy and see which files you want to pay

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:14,600
attention to this gets tedious so it's

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,180
nice handy automation to have something

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,040
to help you out with that and not again

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:26,240
not do anything automatically and

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:32,840
clobber what you wanted done so as far

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:35,360
as the actual another philosophy a lot

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,730
of distributions might have gotten or

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,070
you know like a familiar topic for a lot

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,070
of people is the Ubuntu desktop meta

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,920
package but the package has little if

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,810
any actual context to it except for a

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,120
chain of dependencies that you know

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:53,570
resolve out to a whole suite of software

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,030
so were you on a bun to server you could

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,830
go to app get installed Ubuntu desktop

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,670
and it would know how to resolve or

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:04,250
should know how to resolve that set

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:06,560
in the idea of that ultimate collection

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,320
of what all do I need to resolve a

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,260
working open to desktop this is the

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,840
notion that's already preset in place of

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,500
not not saying it for desktop usage but

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,030
a collection of software that is

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,380
all-inclusive it is whether you're a

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,550
developer whether you're a web

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,570
administrator or whether you're a

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:30,470
desktop user this whole suite top to

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:33,410
bottom of packages that's that's that's

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,910
the Slackware installation it'd be the

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,350
same if you were going through the

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,630
installer and said I want the full

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:43,160
install I don't want a cherry-pick just

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:47,680
go do the installation it's 936 packages

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:51,740
less like KT internationalization which

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,630
you might need might not and then in

00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,510
extra there's a few other Play packages

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,480
like Google Chrome and health but other

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:05,000
other dependencies for those packages

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:07,340
and then slack builds org dan did a nice

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,320
job alluding to this earlier slack

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,850
builds is the community organize project

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,620
where you can say hey I installed

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,040
Slackware but it does not have you know

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,860
X package I want X package slack bells

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,600
org is it allows the community to go

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,430
through and build their own sets of

00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,230
instructions to build those packages and

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,450
there's now an automated tool where you

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,910
can say go through and build everything

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,580
or fetch whatever it is for me to have

00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:35,060
you know OpenOffice or whatever libery

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,640
office and it can do that so there's

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:41,480
quite a number of packages out there and

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,370
it's nice because users can any end user

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,450
can end up becoming a contributor in

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,000
that own right and having their own

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,800
stake and maintainer ship of something

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,270
and become like a subject matter expert

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:57,770
in you know good new cash or something

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,980
so do what

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,350
yeah what would anyone I'm gonna do that

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,300
so the package structures are pretty

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,429
straightforward they're tar bones

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,950
if you've ever seen any site that offers

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:12,020
a you know variety of different

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,730
distributions to download its you know

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:19,309
Deborah rpm or whatever and then a tgz

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,350
which immediately you're like that's all

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:23,780
too familiar that's a tar.gz yes that's

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,840
that's all it is and you look inside of

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,340
it and it's not any kind of separate sub

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,630
components or whatever it's a file

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:35,860
system tree relative to slash the only

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:39,230
meta type de but data is going to be the

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,800
you'll see at root slash an install

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,720
directory with usually two files a slack

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,630
disk which is this the description of

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,450
what component it is like info and then

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,370
the douens twitch is a the only scripts

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,830
during the installation and it is a post

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,170
install so as far as like pre-install

00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,870
post install pre uninstall post

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,720
uninstall that might you might be

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:07,429
familiar with its this is just a post

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:11,090
install so here's another this is a

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:14,510
mildly up up the stakes on this one what

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:16,330
what else can be used in a stock slacker

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,960
installation and judging it the

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:21,550
character of answering the other

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,550
questions no no this one's gonna flop

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,050
give him from the core group no so

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,110
you've got var var log set up package

00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,809
name so you can actually if you had some

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,580
things you wanted to ask questions of

00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:40,340
the user when it goes through the post

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,690
installation like a configuration how do

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,160
you want me to handle this or do you

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:47,210
want me to set it up like this or like

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,160
that this is like a place to put scripts

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,130
that are typically going to be curses or

00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,720
dialogue based so you can walk through

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,510
and actually have menus and ask the user

00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,770
like prompt the user for something when

00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,120
it's going through to configure itself

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,120
after post installation

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:10,179
so the tools this is the magic so any

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,990
one of these man pages you'll find that

00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:15,700
there's a tremendous amount of there

00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,990
yeah this tremendous amount of

00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,559
documentation a decent amount of other

00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:22,750
flags most people are ever going to

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,790
stick on the last three installing a

00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,390
package removing a package or upgrade

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:31,600
package if you're using slack pkg it

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:33,580
just calls these it's it's it's a front

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,840
end to all these things so these are

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,300
what actually walks through and make

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,980
sure you don't like clobber old fart

00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,470
that you do clobber old files or don't

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:46,300
remove a file that's still owned by

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:48,460
another package but they even offer some

00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,380
fancy fun stuff that is nice sometimes

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,750
when archiving or wanting to look at a

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,580
package say hey I've already installed

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,640
this to my system I need to reassemble

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,679
that tar.gz or I need to rebuild that

00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,620
file structure from this existing

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,000
package it's within these tools that you

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,950
could go through and actually say hey

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,200
here's a package up installed recreate

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,670
me or you know build the files things so

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,179
I can target you see it again and make a

00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:18,780
package back out of it so it's pretty

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:21,940
handy stuff as far as any of the

00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,340
installed information its VAR log

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,890
packages or var log scripts so you want

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,110
to see what do I have installed what

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,500
files does it own what scripts did it

00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,059
run during installation this is it I

00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,890
mean it's it's a directory full of files

00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:38,140
that you can walk through

00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:41,910
nothing nothing illusive just a little

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,910
bit of bookkeeping to see where it was

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:49,900
yeah yeah I mean you don't need anything

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,910
more than less or more whatever can't

00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,260
you know you don't need more or less

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:59,200
than more or less because each each one

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,300
of the nodes and these directories is a

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,660
flat text file that is the name of the

00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,960
package less the tar.gz and the contents

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,970
of it are the description and the files

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,470
that's that's it so you can you can sit

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,820
there and walk around rather than how

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:17,440
to know what Flags to search for what

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,600
once you upgrade or remove them they

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,730
moved in the same var log but to remove

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,799
two packages or remove scripts so you

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,559
could see a history of when did I

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,480
upgrade this when did I remove this what

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,500
did that I knew I had it and I had

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,450
uninstalled it

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:38,470
what did on this file so grepping around

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,600
here is super straightforward I guess

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,549
the only the only other elusive or

00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,480
whatever part when a lot of people are

00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:48,159
used to a GUI desktop and you boot into

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,980
the Installer and you get a command line

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,630
you've walked to the command you walk to

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,010
the Installer and it reboots and it's

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,480
like yeah you've got an installed slack

00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,710
where boggs it's a command line most

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
people say where's my point-and-click

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,390
where's my where's my GUI where's my

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,080
desktop so xorg

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,700
is really it's kind of a choice it's not

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,070
like we're going to shove one way or the

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,299
other down your throat it's not just

00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:17,380
getting a command lines not saying

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:21,250
you've got a server now it's just a raw

00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,890
box like this is what it starts with so

00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,020
if you chose to go the route of a

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,789
command line and not even still not to

00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,750
say it's a server

00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:34,289
I don't need X on this server you've got

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,520
all the tools you need to have a robust

00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:39,400
desktop that's just command line

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:43,690
oriented be it editors be it music

00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:48,190
players be it games be it god-knows-what

00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:52,330
newsreaders chat clients all of that it

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:55,840
is very very inordinately very much

00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:57,669
robust and all the tools like it any

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,650
given day you can go peruse packages and

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:03,220
find new commands that you had no idea

00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:06,580
existed just for a command line use so

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:11,919
you server command line desktop or an X

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:14,049
desktop this command is owned by slack

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,260
the slack where packages itself so this

00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:20,049
is another slack or specific command but

00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:24,820
xwm config so you boot into your user

00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:25,330
you login for the first time and xwm

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,760
config

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,700
let you say hey I want to use you know

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,190
this user wants to use KDE or xfce or

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,430
any one of the default window managers

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:38,770
that comes on a slack installation you

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,780
can set this up and it all the does is

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,990
create or make a symlink for it your ex

00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,700
and it RC and then start X the way you

00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:56,970
go this is that now you're at official

00:32:45,700 --> 00:33:01,090
desktop yes yeah it does it does it does

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:03,820
still say it says on the newbie install

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:08,290
so the question was does the Installer

00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:10,660
still inform you that to install would

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,390
take a year and it's actually under the

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:16,690
if you choose the newbie installation

00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:18,460
which you know just like Linux from

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,260
scratch reading the documentation it

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,550
will walk you through each package do

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,280
you want to install this package do you

00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:26,440
want to install this package it says to

00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,510
walk through this 4x org very well could

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,610
take a year because it's so modular

00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,080
there's so many components that to

00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,890
acknowledge each one of them do you want

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,460
excise install do you want it'll take a

00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,890
while so yes that is still there and

00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,810
that that section of the installer has

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,080
been left the same way for a long time

00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:50,680
until this last release there's no well

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,970
yeah it's this that part of the

00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,710
installer has been the same way for a

00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,300
long time but now there's been a terse

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:59,550
added so it'll actually run through

00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:01,570
stuff with it abbreviated that most

00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,830
recommendations unless you know what

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,250
you're doing and even then it comes with

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,230
caveats of just do a full install

00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,490
because it makes the playground more

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,560
equal of knowing

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:14,560
oh you're seeing this bug is you because

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,490
you chose to not install this sub suite

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:23,530
of libraries because you didn't

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:26,320
recognize the name so kernels

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,190
it's it's it's a pretty again vanilla

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,190
process very very very rarely will you

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,139
ever see a patch to the kernel because

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,349
usually the kernel itself will have some

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,760
kind of new update that is pushed out

00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,629
very quickly if there's a CV or

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,659
something like that

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:46,200
so what you get is if you double you get

00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:51,369
add something off of what kernel.org

00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:54,250
there's two two kernels effectively two

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:57,670
kernels available in slack we're a huge

00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:59,290
which is a just a large kernel it's not

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,380
an all-inclusive kernel because they're

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,210
still a OS but you could stick it on

00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,680
most anything and it will boot and have

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,230
everything it needs for multiple file

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,470
systems multiple Hardware types it's

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,560
it's all there the generic is trimmed

00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,760
down a lot but it's still from the same

00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,440
core config and it's very interesting

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,820
and I'm not jealous of the job of

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,270
walking through that configuration

00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,090
script pad not a little bit but generic

00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:28,990
you must have an init Rd in a ram disk

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:31,089
so earlier you saw them MK init Rd to

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,550
use generic you must have an init Ram

00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:38,380
disk because it won't know what ext3 is

00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:40,060
yeah you know it's it's pretty trim the

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,369
interesting part of having two different

00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:46,300
kernels that are very different in that

00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:46,960
nature they all use the same tree of dot

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,200
Kos

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,460
all the modules so regardless of whether

00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,109
you boot into one or I though it's not

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,339
like you're maintaining two large sets

00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:58,930
of drivers this aspect of it still not

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:01,240
least mystical to me but I have not

00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:04,089
taken the time or brain cycles to figure

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,820
out how and why this is possible but to

00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:07,630
have two totally different

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,540
configurations and they pull from the

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:13,480
same kernel modules good luck with that

00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,580
so hacking hacking the kernel it seems

00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,460
like a lot of people there one of their

00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:21,760
first like what Twitter posts in life or

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:24,490
a hey I installed slacker and I install

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,770
you know compiled the latest kernel you

00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,970
know this is like an achievement a

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:33,320
bumper sticker they want to put on their

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:36,360
car start first off

00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,230
whatever it is if you're using like the

00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,640
current development branch or 1337

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,650
whatever repo version you're using go

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,490
check in the directory of testing first

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:50,130
because not uncommon you will find like

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:53,910
our less slacker released shipped with

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:56,280
you know certainly - 637 version but in

00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,560
testing for this official release there

00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,890
was two more kernel versions in there so

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,980
if people wanted to try 38 and 39 you

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:07,080
shipped yeah there's there's two newer

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,390
kernels there but they were just kind of

00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,880
like hey give it a try so we could get

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,340
some feedback if it broke or work for

00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,000
other people but as far as the stable

00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,800
version it's not there so go chicken

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,220
testing first it'll be a good place to

00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,690
find how it was done any configuration

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:31,230
differences the source of the current

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:34,410
running Linux kernel is in user source

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:36,270
Linux so you know you're playing with

00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:39,360
some new thing that needs to see the

00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,680
headers or you know anytime you've had

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,480
something that says hey I need your

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,060
kernel headers like an Nvidia blob or

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,590
something like that there's no extra

00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,750
packages that you need to go out and say

00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,490
hey I need development packages and I

00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,780
need a compiler and I need my kernel

00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,670
headers and all that no that's that's

00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,400
already all built in that's it's in

00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,070
there by default and the full untoward

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,490
Linux sources party on the system and

00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,920
ready to go and we've we've opted for

00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,580
the kernel configuration so that in the

00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,930
current running like active state kernel

00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,650
proc

00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:16,110
config GZ you know it's a kernel space

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,150
foul but that file is the configuration

00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,880
for your for the kernel so if you needed

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,370
to see what flags were chosen or you

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,050
know does it or does it not have config

00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:30,540
underscore blah it's in that file so if

00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:33,720
you wanted to be super leet and go out

00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:41,280
and you know download Linux 3.0 RC -

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:41,990
whoo eww get that foul lint are it CD -

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,269
it

00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:49,439
Zeke at your proc config

00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:53,099
make old config and away you go this

00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:55,529
there's no like worrying about have what

00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,140
patches were applied after they got the

00:38:55,529 --> 00:39:00,900
kernel what version you know like if it

00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,029
says its kernel to 6:37 dot you know

00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,779
blah that's it's straight from

00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:05,009
kernel.org

00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:09,209
you could you could go fetch it and

00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:15,630
reproduce the you know approximate it by

00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:17,489
yourself so that having been said that

00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,719
this is like an achievement that people

00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,169
want to compile their own kernel and you

00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:26,729
should to get familiar with the process

00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:28,890
when you do that please if you ever seen

00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:32,039
any kind of peculiar is how I rebooted

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:34,109
and now I can't start X go back to a

00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,589
stock kernel and revalidate it before

00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:39,329
you come saying to people you know oh my

00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:41,239
god all the stuff that's not working

00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:45,329
anymore or you know it's broken

00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,349
no you ventured out into left field and

00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:49,739
you don't know how to find your way home

00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:52,019
just validate it gets the stock kernel

00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:54,569
and if anything asks for help or say hey

00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:56,519
I'm trying to get X running on this you

00:39:54,569 --> 00:40:00,900
know I've tried x and y what do I need

00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,159
to do because frequently I mean starting

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,709
X is pretty straightforward because

00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,119
there's a lot of drivers but a lot of

00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:08,699
times there might be other obscure

00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:13,759
things that start breaking or clocks are

00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:16,229
off or who knows what it's out there so

00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:19,650
as far as the slacker community if you

00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:21,329
go to slacker comm you'll find odds and

00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,319
ends links to where to find information

00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:28,229
or you know facts or thanks to these

00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:30,359
group of people or whatever but as far

00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:32,069
as like a actual formidable place

00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:34,709
sometimes people will hunt around for a

00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:38,159
minute or they aren't it's not for it's

00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:40,739
not shouted in your face of hey new

00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,549
Linux user you know come to this place

00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:47,669
so you wonder where it is this is about

00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:51,509
the extent of where you will find the

00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:53,939
largest selection of Slackware nerds and

00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:55,089
it's really interesting even that like

00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:59,769
using it

00:40:55,089 --> 00:41:02,789
AOL s alt OS linux slackware is a very

00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:05,739
active and very peculiar group of people

00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:09,640
and and it's it's been that way for a

00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:11,589
long time and if you're feeling feisty

00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:15,069
you can you're welcome to go ask

00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:18,609
questions or offer yourself up to the to

00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:20,650
the to the trolls but these are still

00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,960
wealth of informations so if you ever

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,309
wanted to search back on archives these

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,099
things are out there

00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:29,650
Linux questions org fantastic website

00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:32,650
that's considered to be the the forum of

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:35,349
choice for Slackware so if you want to

00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:38,589
search how to's or if other people are

00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:41,950
having this issue or whatever or ask a

00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:45,630
question of say whatever check out Linux

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:48,309
questions org that's the Earl and

00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:51,190
frequently I mean like we don't we all

00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:53,559
watch it to some extent but frequently a

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,839
lot of reports and stuff like that come

00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,789
through this means like other people

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,920
saying hey are you having this issue we

00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:02,890
all watch that so you know as far as

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,989
like reporting an issue this is one

00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:08,109
that's one of the main ways to come in I

00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:11,769
don't most of these are all good but the

00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:13,390
last two are mailing lists this I mean

00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:14,650
this is really like idle hands like

00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,849
sometimes you'll get into some good

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:20,469
discussions but it's still out there

00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:22,660
additional packages and more community

00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:23,890
as slack builds or gets been a really

00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,739
fantastic thing it's given a lot of

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,969
people a platform for expression a lot

00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:29,829
of people just wanted to have something

00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:32,200
that they owned and that's great for

00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:35,710
them it's got its own mailing list an

00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,660
IRC channel so if you want to get more

00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,539
involved or familiar with packaging and

00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:43,450
what that means and the life and woes of

00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:45,549
a packager and how to relate anything

00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,589
how to work with upstream as a packager

00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:53,259
this is a great place to get your hands

00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:56,200
wet get your hands dirty feet wet so bug

00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:58,930
tracking there is no bug tracker there's

00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,839
no you know place to login

00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:03,210
do this formal form and you're given a

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,200
number and you're asked to please wait

00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,559
none of that

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,369
if you correspond with somebody on the

00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,710
team you can get yourself heard that way

00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,329
or if through the forum's you've you've

00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,730
discussed something in depth and even if

00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:21,210
you haven't found about yourself then

00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:26,109
frequently you know it'll be over some

00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:28,630
emails and forums but there's not much

00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:30,789
os to interfere with so as far as

00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:34,869
actually reporting bugs on the operating

00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:37,000
system it's it's interesting sometimes

00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:39,940
because even is like a metric of like

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,700
how many bugs are we getting it's pretty

00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:47,170
irrelevant because most of the time we

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:49,450
don't and it really shouldn't yeah don't

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,339
we do not even really should not hear

00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:54,430
about most of the bug reports because if

00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:57,910
there's a problem in this program the

00:43:54,430 --> 00:44:00,039
bug report goes to that program not to

00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:04,210
us it shouldn't come to us because we're

00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:05,920
not the writers of it so most of the

00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,720
time it's just the little massaging zuv

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,010
why is this not working with another app

00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:14,829
and one although that might have been

00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:17,109
how we told it to install that so you

00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:21,039
see people overuse this and I don't know

00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:24,460
how its properly used but keep it simple

00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:27,279
there's not a lot of magic and if

00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,349
anything there's like a zone of slack

00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:30,910
where as in of Linux when you get to it

00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,079
because it's like the more you focus on

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,180
it and the more you try and look into

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,450
what it is there's nothing there I mean

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,349
it's as far as what defines this thing

00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:41,470
you've become enlightened to the

00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:46,349
emptiness of what's actually there so

00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,349
just keep it simple no automatic

00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,430
questions from anybody

00:44:55,369 --> 00:45:00,239
the question was where any lemons harmed

00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,829
in the making of this slide presentation

00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:15,809
I can neither confirm nor deny that one

00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:21,329
yeah so what nicely so here's the links

00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:22,920
to this slide show what else that the

00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:24,960
slide is actually the show the slide

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,109
show is already published up on on the

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,089
website and it was done using a pretty

00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:35,249
interesting product project Ruby project

00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:40,099
called show off anyhow so if there's no

00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:45,779
more questions then that is it I'm good

00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:47,130
to last pieces of user swag and these

00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:51,329
things are not going out to anybody so

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:54,809
who can use a 32-bit or a 64-bit

00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:59,430
installer on USB for Slackware anybody

00:45:54,809 --> 00:46:01,880
oh I'll choke amongst you so brace

00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,880
yourself

00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:24,030
well I was like line drives yeah I know

00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:30,990
no injuries I was not a baseball player

00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:33,240
oh yeah so if at the at the booth if if

00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:35,100
anybody has a CD or whatever else we

00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,140
have a local mirror set up so you can

00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,860
you know sync it off if you need to do

00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:43,130
or want to do that so you know thank you

00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,130
very much

00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,970
that's not the word out

00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,970
you

00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:30,680
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:32,300
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,250
cloud is just the next generation of

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,140
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:38,090
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,290
we're in a unique position to really

00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,390
help bring these two worlds together

00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:43,730
these different sets of technologies and

00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:46,070
to help companies embrace this new world

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,140
in this great new tool that allows

00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,660
faster innovation not only is it about

00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:56,060
us being responsive and accountable but

00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:58,900
it's about us doing more for you webos

00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:02,480
an OS that works the way that you do

00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:06,580
