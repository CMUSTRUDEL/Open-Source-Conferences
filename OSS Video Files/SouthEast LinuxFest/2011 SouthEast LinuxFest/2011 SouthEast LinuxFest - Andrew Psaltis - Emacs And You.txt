the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,929
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,429

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,090
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,240
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:01:06,210
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,240 --> 00:01:09,260
make these videos indeed well yeah real

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,810
programmers use Emacs phim ed cat a

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,520
needle or butterflies put then again

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,100
it's Emacs so you can use butterflies in

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:24,390
Emacs which apparently some people find

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,100
funny so I magic result is this is Emacs

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,020
a new introduction to the Emacs text

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,570
editor and before I get into any of the

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,759
funnel detail oh never mind let's talk

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,549
about why don't I talk about first so

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm going to go talk about exactly what

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,810
MX is I am assuming overall minimal

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,119
knowledge of the editor and just how to

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,360
get how you get it why or why not should

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,399
you use it some of the terminology since

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,560
its cincy max is special and has its own

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,070
terminology of things go over some

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,909
commands some of how to configure it and

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,850
some cool stuff that I think is I

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:09,000
personally find useful or in the case of

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:13,720
the last topic they're not particularly

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,590
useful so this is a one of the quote

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,510
commonly seen in the Emacs IRC channel

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,700
we are I'm not going to lie emacs sucks

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,680
some of us tolerate it but we can't tell

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,210
if you'll be able to try it and make up

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,340
your own mind they're up UX is and is

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,050
extremely powerful but at the same time

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,320
there are some little niggling

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,090
frustrations that can not you until you

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,330
get tired of it and used something else

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:45,580
that may be considered a little more

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:48,810
sane but your mileage may vary so what

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,750
is the max e Max's I came from the

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,320
editor Matt goes for the good old tako

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,850
editor and quote the IRC channel it's a

00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,920
very extent it's an extensible

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,030
customizable stuff document in real-time

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,700
display editor and this is all all of

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,670
those are very true and very emphasized

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,410
a Jessamine car including IRC clients

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:16,209
web browsers music players and image

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:18,670
viewers yeah some and don't forget the

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,190
standard email client that everyone

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:26,290
loves to foe who I never have to leave

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:30,820
Max's I can check my mail okay so how do

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,860
you get it well you asked your package

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,470
manager to install you max whatever it's

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,680
called it however you until your package

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,030
management sowwie max it's that that if

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,200
the package name is not a maxed and

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,720
there's something terribly wrong and

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,820
make sure you don't assault XDM x XDM x

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,060
does not count and a lot of the stuff

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,480
will not work a lot of so add may not

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,630
work as well or may have different names

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:59,200
so why are why not Emacs so let's start

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:01,060
with why emacs is very future full in

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,730
fact it's notoriously feature phul to

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,620
the point of where you can eat where

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,320
people have claimed it to be massively

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,790
bloated extremely extensible this goes

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,840
along with unified configuration

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:16,180
language emacs itself is a lisp

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,799
interpreter with an editor on pic with

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,870
an editor in front of it so you can

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,200
easily just go Chuck a bunch of Lisp

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,550
into it and it will magically go and do

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,100
you can bring it to do pretty much

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,920
anything there's like there's even all

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,380
addie bus interface now integration with

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,820
many external tools in this case you can

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:42,430
just have Emacs run your say your Python

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,770
shell or your octave shell or or other

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,270
or other interactive tools I don't have

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,820
to go absolutely switch between windows

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:55,300
to go find the find or rather use your

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,900
rear shells so why not Emacs or why to

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,060
ignore the e-series of slacker send some

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,830
so kind since this man over here so

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,990
kindly told me that the reason why the

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,870
e-series and psycho only contains emacka

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,230
so people can just promptly ignore it

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,270
there you go all of the things people

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,910
say of all the people things people say

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,370
about Emacs are true it is bloated there

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,280
is so much extra stuff in Emacs that you

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,010
will never use never c never be able to

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,290
find out about because there's so much

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,390
of it but these days you have so much

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,430
hard drives there's enough hard hard

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,870
where space is cheap and it and my

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,620
graphics drivers actually take up more

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,940
space in Emacs which is a awesome slow

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:43,030
startup if you have a very large

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,250
configuration which I do you can the

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,170
Emacs could take a few seconds to start

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,480
up which is not necessarily suited to

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,920
the workflow of constantly open and make

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,090
small light its bunch of small heads to

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,150
txt files it's best to just leave it

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,860
open and then open it and then open up a

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,540
bunch of files while you're in the same

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,420
process although there is a way around

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,300
that I'll talk about it later and the

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,220
default configuration is not well I

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,470
wouldn't say saying even though i did

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,750
it's not really that nice for people

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,240
there's some things that people would

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,650
want really like to see like why numbers

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:25,390
that are not enabled in the default

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:27,700
Emacs set up so terminology so here's

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:32,050
where all here do i get to explain all

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,520
the all the Emacs words so the whole

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,750
instead of being actually called a

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,780
window the entire Emacs entity is called

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,150
a frame individual splits inside of the

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:49,090
it are in turn called windows thus

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:51,430
window frame each window contains a load

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,810
line that contains various information

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,350
about what the buffer contains and about

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,180
what about contains and various other

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:05,020
information about the buffer you can

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,030
have the different what's the same wind

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,310
same window buffer can be displayed in

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,510
different windows as you can stay here

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,380
and this will this the yellow region is

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,990
the is called the it's called the region

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,370
between the mark which is a considered a

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,980
preview which is a Capri vyas cursor

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,830
location and the point which is the

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,419
actual cursor and the mini buffer is

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,180
this handy little thing at the bottom

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:36,090
that that what which you've enter in

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:39,070
commands and yes that does say Tetris

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,870
the keyboard when I talk about Emacs

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,800
commands eventually I'll start talking

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:47,950
about a bunch of a keyboard stuff so

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:52,210
when I say see I mean control I say em I

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:57,060
City meadow or alts so if I were to go

00:07:52,210 --> 00:08:01,360
want to do MX butterfly I would do an X

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:03,190
type in butterfly and then press enter

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,660
and enter prompt me if I want to enlist

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,660
a powerseller fly I say yes

00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:16,970
and it's looked a bit I don't know if it

00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:20,030
actually does that or not so last bit of

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,770
terminology with each buffer is each but

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,680
with each buffer you have associated

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,260
modes you can only have one major mode /

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,910
buffer in this major modes usually get

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,290
any features like syntax highlighting

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,940
smart indentation and they're familiar

00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:38,169
with their generally limited in scope

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:44,180
the programming languages like C Python

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:47,480
XML c++ HTML all that stuff minor modes

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,470
provide general editor functionality you

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,010
might want to have spread across

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:55,340
different buffer that are there buff

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,770
their major mode independent like fiber

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,560
which is VI emulations I'll talk about

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,570
that later fly spell which is on which

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,910
is a on the fly spell checking course

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,040
opens of a nice fella process and runs a

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,590
bunch and constantly check your spelling

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,560
and hide show minor iron mode which is

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,630
code folding and actually now i'm only

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,120
think what hydro minor mode is that the

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,870
default key binding involves pressing

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,010
the fall pressing three different keys

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:31,250
so like CC control see the @ at symbol

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:33,830
shift 2 and the actual command and yeah

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,880
yeah thats my that's my thought

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,490
precisely on this it's a it does as it

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,620
was one thing that other editors get a

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:48,080
lot better than Emacs does and faces are

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:54,020
fonts and their associated attributes

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,340
like color way at alexs etc so now we

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,630
get into the little fun of where i talk

00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,180
about how to use this thing so unlike VI

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:05,510
e Max's modal you can do whatever

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,240
whenever although in some cases a lot of

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,430
commands will just go and start

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,530
bothering you if you try to say open a

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,370
if you try to do something like a file

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,800
operation when you

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,180
upbeat godia they try to something in

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,380
the mini buffer area will say you're

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,990
trying to use the mini buffer ball using

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,339
the mini buffer which can get annoying

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:28,230
when you don't know what you've pressed

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,270
alright so if there's one thing that you

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,540
probably should remember it is how it

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,150
get a vmax so here it is the press ctrl

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,950
x + ctrl c e mext emacs will ask you to

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,589
save your save your buffers and it will

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,670
promptly died if you never want to see

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:46,589
it again you can remove it from your

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,660
system so anybody you can call commit

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,450
and you can actually call an arbitrary

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,839
list command with Lisp command from

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,270
wherever all keys and emacs are bound to

00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,700
some sort of a lisp function or c

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,070
function that is bound to lisp in fact

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,110
even typing on the keyboard is bound to

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,450
a command it's called self insert

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,320
command and takes an hour which is the

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,350
letter you're trying to insert into the

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,850
buffer all functions that are declared

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,710
interactive in the function himself can

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,529
be called with MX command name like

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,730
butterfly was that in that was the one I

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,010
was using earlier hats declared

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,160
interactive and does all that little fun

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:26,070
magic with the with the buffer with the

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,430
windows control x control c itself is

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:32,310
bound to save buffers quit emacs and you

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,080
if you somehow remember save buffer

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,290
squiddy max but not control x control c

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,279
you can type in mx8 buffers quit Emacs

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:45,330
and press ENTER and then you will save

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,520
quit Emacs and MX some function is just

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,209
some way to you can just call arbitrary

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,380
functions by doing MX some function and

00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,029
any and if you're ever in the mini

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,190
buffer and want to escape for whatever

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:58,140
reason if you are trying if you

00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,610
accidentally press ctrl a ctrl C and you

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,279
don't actually want to quit and you

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:05,940
forget the whatever one default button

00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:09,600
there is to abort the quit operation you

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,959
can press ctrl G that I probably needs

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,450
that a lot here so how to move you can

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,459
use the arrow keys I use the arrow keys

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:22,440
there are bindings other than the arrow

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:25,800
keys and yeah not really so actually

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,420
move there is everything it says Emacs

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,140
is not modal everything is bound to

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,890
control

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,380
or all etta or whatever so itself you

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:37,910
can move forward backward up and down by

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,590
using CF cbcp and see him respectively

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,620
these bindings I first are not

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:46,560
particularly well ergonomic in my

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,290
opinion VI gets it right with using H

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,180
kjl repeat for for these simple motions

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,570
but saw a lot of people have gotten used

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,190
to them over time and they've grown to

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,980
like a man there's there does stuff

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,230
there s there's the defaults and they're

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,550
kind of easy to remember but because

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,290
they match but how would you forget that

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,290
control that you can move backwards with

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,370
control be because it could be back were

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:17,280
charged with be so now again two more

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:19,050
larger movement increments control a

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,270
moves the beginning of the line control

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,310
we moves at the end of the line you can

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,740
move forward and backward with MF and if

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:29,670
be you can go to the end of the buffer

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,370
with the writing and met a right angle

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,340
bracket and beginning with the left

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:40,350
angle bracket and then you can jump to

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:43,740
any arbitrary line with meta GG so here

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,720
is my handy little buffer here this is

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:52,430
actually my presentation I actually my

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,430
presentation so I can just go and

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,980
okay yeah i'm using a command lager here

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,810
that does not necessarily like to record

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,280
some functions because they happen so

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,760
often because every single time you type

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:13,760
it would say self insert command letter

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:17,300
and forward backward word for word word

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,700
and then I personally found that these

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,300
uh these actually go between the word

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,760
characters so you so you'll have just

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,290
humongous blob of punk like you'll be

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,590
coding you'll have this large blob of

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,810
quotes and parenthesis emacs will that

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,630
this command will go straight from the

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,040
previous word character to that people

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,100
work here to the previous word character

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,140
which one you're trying to go over and

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,540
just delete the thing up to the next the

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:49,040
next symbol which is what every other

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,890
editor does was well every other non VI

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,950
hender does way I find found that just

00:14:51,890 --> 00:15:00,980
to be quite aggravating and you can go

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:05,810
to the end end to the beginning easily

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:10,610
and go to arbitrary line let's go two

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:12,650
hundred and the reason why there's two

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,740
bindings for this is that eventual at

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:19,010
eventually people pressed and forgot to

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:23,080
lift the bed icky in time to make em

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:27,260
just to mgg so they mound it to both to

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:30,020
keep people saying I guess all right

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,050
back we go so you can repeat action

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:39,620
repeat any action by using control you

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:44,000
or meta you so if I go back to my humax

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:49,690
window I can go down let's say I want to

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:56,960
go down 40 lines I would do control you

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:58,370
40 control p and I would go and it would

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,110
go down for your lines lesson able line

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:07,010
numbers so if I want to go up 40 lines i

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:11,339
would use or I could do alt

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:13,770
40 control n actually I was doing it

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:18,420
that I just thought backwards that's

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,890
nice and as you can see all the extra

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,800
stuff going on the command log down

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:27,690
there so I had to put the internet so

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,150
see you by itself well if without a

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,770
number will default to multiplying

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:37,020
whatever previous statement you have by

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:41,339
four so if you do see you see you

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:44,339
control p you'll move right for you move

00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:48,150
up four lines if you move if you do it

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:50,940
see you see you see p you'll go up 16

00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,620
lines and then you can just insert any

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,120
arbitrary number and you can move

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,080
massive distances in short amount of

00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,360
time but I've without actually having to

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,260
go mash the button of the times which is

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,360
a nice feature so but simple file

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,280
manipulation control wife's control f

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,230
opens a file control ice control I saves

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,890
the saves the current buffer to a file

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,559
and ctrl a ctrl w does the whole state

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:19,500
as deal if you already have a file open

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:24,660
emacs we'll just switch to the buffer

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,809
when you use ctrl x control f okay

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,910
window and buffer manipulation Emacs and

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:34,250
lets you go split up buffers and windows

00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:37,470
and do all sorts of little fun things so

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,990
see here so this is itself as a split

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,429
here split into two windows this is a

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,740
bit of a this is not really persistent

00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:47,370
buffer but if i go up here I can do

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,760
control x to get a horizontal split it

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,920
defaults to the previous preview

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,679
whatever the current buffer is I can do

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,620
control x 32 split it again vertically

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,470
and these splits can be done orbit an

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:08,880
arbitrary number of times to close a

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:10,440
split you would do control x 0 and s

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,910
blitz are completely different you can

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,570
do you can be in completely different

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:20,990
places and completely replaces in dif

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:30,930
different windows with the same

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:34,500
buffering them what's next so if i

00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:37,500
wanted to make the oscar the current

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,860
split the only one in the window middle

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,440
so i can go do control x 1 all the other

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:50,550
ones will go away let me get my command

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:53,160
line let me get my tran log back so if

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,600
you have a multi if you have many so if

00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,630
you want to just change buffers like

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,790
this is a 1 i'll be going to later you

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,010
can just do control x be with a buffer

00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,810
name everything is tap completed so you

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,490
don't actually has remember the name it

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:13,320
defaults to the previous one you were at

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:18,360
and to get a list of the buffers you can

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,270
do control x control be you can see all

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,610
the other buffers i have open and may

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,290
should i'll probably show you later if

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,950
you don't Chloe if you don't actually

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:33,150
explicitly kill the buffer with CX

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,010
control xk it will stay around forever

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,290
in the running in the background it will

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:42,120
just not be visible on the screen so

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:43,950
control x ke dil SE kill will kill the

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,780
cold killa buffer it will default to the

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,180
first one you have opened you have to

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,330
press enter i have personally found that

00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:55,560
to be quite annoying so in my config i

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:59,250
have remapped my remapped control xk to

00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,260
kill and kill the current buffer as its

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:05,480
Jedi just I do it enough to make it to

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:09,570
warrant having to deal with that so

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,310
let's go back the Lexi guy is the help

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,810
system it's not really it's not called

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,610
Emacs is not called the self documenting

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:21,710
editor for nothing so let's go back here

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:24,510
so I'd say I want to go look up the

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,690
documentation for the function butterfly

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:31,130
so I would do ctrl H F which is

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,720
described function type in butterfly and

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,040
it will say

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,780
that it will use a butterfly split with

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,690
desire bit in the device platter open

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,770
handle with the delicate wings flap once

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,640
service all those hours change the flow

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,990
of the eddy currents in the upper

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,330
atmosphere has caused momentary pockets

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:48,540
of higher pressure air to form blah blah

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:53,160
blah blah blah and they they pretty much

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:57,900
had some add some fun mxf took some fun

00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:00,090
with that and use it again so if you

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,830
ever accidentally press a key binding

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,800
and you want to go figure out what that

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:08,450
key does you can do you can do that with

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:12,660
ctrl H K and then you can just do an

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,700
arbitrary keyboard command one of the

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,400
ones that I accidentally like to do

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:22,800
sometimes is control x control q because

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:25,260
I think a cute stands for quit right no

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,750
it's not it changes the read-only Pinto

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,240
of the of the / on the permissions on

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,100
the file that threw me for a loop

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,090
multiple times when it wouldn't let me

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:41,040
save my files after I did that that was

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:42,360
a blast and a half so and next if you

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,220
ever start actually getting into

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,140
configuring Emacs eventually you find so

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,450
what setting does what and you'll have

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,250
to go do ctrl H B which is described

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:57,320
variable and you can do

00:21:52,250 --> 00:22:05,270
ooh many things here I cannot think of a

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:10,940
variable at the top of I was it okay

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:12,320
well there's that one so it should so

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,090
this is just a bunch so apparently

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,130
lightech paragraph commands is a

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,780
variable in the file like tacky l it

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,440
says where it is same deal with

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,540
functions and this is and you can just

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,520
kind of gives document everything all

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,550
the documentation just goes here and you

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:36,460
can even customize the variable but I

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:36,460
will get to that blasts

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,460
so there's also search CSS forward

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,530
incremental search see artists backward

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,530
incremental search you can go do these

00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,980
are you can just be a lil it's pretty

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:03,160
much search as you type and there's not

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,990
much to say there it's functional the

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,580
mark so I mentioned earlier at the mark

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:12,640
was where your previous course position

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:15,550
was so you can set it with controls you

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,570
can sit you can set it with control

00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:22,540
space even said set the mark and then

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:27,220
you can move the point around and thus

00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:29,380
there's the region if and this is not

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,980
real and usually it's used to select

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,530
things but in some cases it can be use

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,890
more than that when you jump around a

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:42,520
file you can say i want to go to the end

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,380
of the file with the so i'm online 307

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,970
right if I just jump us from our ritory

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,440
position and just do some stuff follow

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,270
my certain members line three or seven

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,510
right so i won't be able to use and meta

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:58,360
GG to go do that so i want to go to the

00:23:52,510 --> 00:24:03,610
end of the file it is and if I want to

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:06,280
go back I would just do control x x

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,220
which swaps where the point is and the

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,960
mark is the entire effect of this is

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,910
that it's imply it's very difficult to

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,750
lose the your actual place in the file

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,970
and and often this instance is often

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,250
used for selection the default the

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,500
default transient mark mode will display

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,440
they will display the region it could be

00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:33,940
turned off if you don't like it plenty

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:36,760
of people don't what is it okay rebec so

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,970
cut and paste emacs has its own little

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,280
kill ring so you so it has the

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,830
completely wheat so it has completely

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:48,400
unconventional cutting Quebec cutting

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:51,490
and pasting can hands so I can just go

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,530
over here it's all opera law all these

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,940
operations are done in the region always

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,059
the ones i have there are ones that

00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,820
operate on paragraphs and lines

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:03,360
but if I want to go get rid of this line

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:07,110
I would do ctrl w and it was door to the

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,549
kill ring and if I would do if I were to

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:15,899
say then cut out this line with the same

00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:23,159
deal normally I would lose the first

00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:25,169
line right but control why pastes the

00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,340
last thing in the buffer hey only

00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:29,220
pasting the top of the killer rain

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,990
however you know however it's a it's a

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,590
ring it remembers what it is so if you

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,440
do my it'll swap it with the last thing

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:44,700
on the top of the killer e and i'll just

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:47,100
go replace that okay well I lost

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,749
something that's cool well I'll be able

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
to get well I'm there was there

00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:51,690
definitely way around that I did I prom

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,580
there wasn't a higher chance I mess it

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,619
up which actually leads to the next

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,769
thing I was going to talk about which is

00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,809
the undo system emacs has three

00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:04,110
different undo keys I do not know why

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,549
this is the case i don't know maybe some

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,519
people got tired of pressing underscore

00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:12,119
or doing or pressing two different keys

00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,279
to undo and having a new repeatedly the

00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,860
thing about Emacs is undo system is

00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,779
unique is that it does not have a redo

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:23,909
all changes to the buffer are recortar

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:27,960
recorded onto the end onto the end of

00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:34,759
the which is probably some sort of list

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,759
structure so i'll just go back here and

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:47,460
so i can just undo some stuff so let's

00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:49,619
undo some things but ok so let's say I

00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:55,860
actually I feel like wanting to change

00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:58,769
something so lose something but normally

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:02,190
you would just go and lose your lose all

00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:04,710
of your previous redos right here you

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,259
can event I can eventually press redo

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,240
enough to go and bring me back to where

00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:13,990
I originally was in the in this

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,450
which is here you can it is very

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,400
difficult to lose your the changes that

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,740
you made even if you messed it up

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,429
accidentally and this I personally I

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:30,760
find that I don't use this enough it is

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:32,380
extremely powerful alright so now we get

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,650
to go into my little short segment on

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,510
configuring amex i'm going to go give

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,370
you a very very very very brief

00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,970
introduction to emacs lisp talk about

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,559
the internal customize interface some of

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,110
the base some configuration files and

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:52,150
how to use external libraries in your

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:53,830
Emacs file so this is this is most of my

00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,390
Emacs config right here either call

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,429
function with some arguments and

00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,980
parenthesis sometimes arguments

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:03,510
themselves can be functions to set a

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:08,860
variable it's set Q variable to how you

00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:11,140
which is also very common and too often

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,190
include a library all you need to do is

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,480
put require and then the library name

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,920
sometimes the library name isn't exactly

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,450
what you think it is you have to look up

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,460
in the documentation often this will

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:25,240
load all the necessary features for the

00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:28,240
library so there's so if you don't feel

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,179
like writing Lisp and I'm blame you you

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,910
can go and do the use the Handy with a

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:38,380
customized feature so let's go back to

00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:41,440
my other buffer here so i can go say i

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,480
want to go this is all so let's say I

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,250
wanted to go modify look at all the

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,640
configuration options related to the c

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:53,440
programming modes so i would do MX

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:57,340
customize group ii max's itself the root

00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:03,160
so and it's just the group for C is C

00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:06,490
and here you go although base all the

00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,220
variables are related to the sea pro of

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:13,330
the sebring language and there are a lot

00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,640
of them this also affects the C++ and

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:20,320
Java and objective-c modes because

00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,850
they're all kind of like C so also you

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,140
happen to know the variable you want to

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,100
customize you have to search through all

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:29,260
this you can just do

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:32,830
to customize variable C electric so

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:36,850
there's also some sorts of variables so

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,919
I can just go pick this one and it gives

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:43,330
the doc gives it and then you can go

00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:45,220
change this value to something else save

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,799
the buffer using ctrl a ctrl s it will

00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:51,520
save the configuration changes to set to

00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:54,400
a to your config file or files if you

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,799
change the location and it will remain

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,600
and will remain permanently until you

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:05,500
actually until you change it yourself in

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:08,919
addition you can go change fonts so if i

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:14,679
don't like this green here i can do MX

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:18,159
customize face and it will give me a

00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,419
whatever face is by default ill pump

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,750
they'll suggest the face that the

00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:24,909
current the cursed point is currently at

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:28,059
so i can go do this and it gives me all

00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:30,789
sorts of neat little information about

00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,559
what i can change it comes with a set of

00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:36,190
colors they can be specified themselves

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,539
through hexadecimal values and i have

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,490
used this on occasion when i've been

00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,380
trying to make me make themes to figure

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,110
out what exactly the colors are and how

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,970
they are set by default right back we go

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:52,090
so configuration files you got your

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,270
standard Emacs if you only have one

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,049
thought one thing to worry about

00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:58,120
sometimes these things you would like to

00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:01,659
put lots of stuff in these is you can

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,909
get really big really fast so personally

00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:07,480
I like to go put everything down XD and

00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:09,370
default config file is knit dl and you

00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,520
can just or all sorts of piles in there

00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,380
and have it kept have it all kept and

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,429
ice block away and if you're crazy like

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,909
me you can put them under version

00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:22,600
control because you can make changes so

00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:24,690
often and off occasionally breaky max so

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,980
adding new libraries you can just

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,000
there's lots of random list files and

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,390
laying around on the internet you can

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,159
get them with the emac stud you can get

00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:37,900
them from various places I put them in

00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:40,900
the in da DMX at the site Lisp directory

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,520
to actually load the file actually get

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,860
make sure your files are visible to the

00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:49,450
system you have to add to the load path

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:52,290
so you have to call the this fun this

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:55,690
function here and as I mentioned before

00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:58,270
the library you just do this require and

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:01,360
it will usually load all the program

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:03,130
library features and sometimes there is

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,390
something get a lot more complicated it

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,550
could be more complicating this amount

00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,460
to have this set up some variables to

00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:12,970
make the thing active maybe more sane or

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,130
not zealous so the Emacs wiki contains a

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,300
lot of information on this and it's

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,450
usually the first thing call when you

00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:22,060
sure about Emacs so now I get to talk

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,010
about cool text editing stuff and the

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,650
first thing for all you VI users out

00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,500
there is Viper mode or Vipers a package

00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:33,700
for MX rebels or there's various other

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,320
back limbs for that so if so I'm just

00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,630
going to go over here and I'm going to

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:43,240
do MX Piper mode and it will prompt me

00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:46,870
with a bunch of extra messages or two

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:52,600
messages and you can tell us to go away

00:32:46,870 --> 00:33:01,060
by pressing Y ok second or press

00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:03,520
something so what ends up really okay

00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,820
this isn't this doesn't happen before so

00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,290
there are various levels of

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,110
functionality that fit that Viper mode

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:15,130
can take away from you to ensure a

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,080
perhaps a more pure VI experience or bi

00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,930
as opposed to if you don't if you just

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,340
want to get used to using Emacs commands

00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,430
so you don't accidentally go do

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:27,400
something crazy and insert mode with out

00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:30,460
actually in meaning to do it so there's

00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,500
various other ones I am I am a wizard

00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,630
because i'm awesome like that so i'll

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,390
press five and it will prompt you want

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:39,010
to make a change permanent this just

00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,470
what this does it makes a file called

00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:47,440
dot viper and source of this command it

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:52,420
at emack sources why not so now i can go

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:58,120
into insert mode I can go type things I

00:33:52,420 --> 00:34:00,160
can go do hjkl move around I can delete

00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,900
a line with DD yeah can undo with you

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:08,320
and do it yeah then by default it uses

00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:13,720
the same standard Emacs over keep this

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,580
humongous undo list thing and it yours

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,850
there's a Emacs package to get make it

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,800
actually do redo instead of undo but and

00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,200
in a lot of cases come is unnecessary

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,600
and one thing that people often MIT

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,669
often really like from them which is

00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,610
where most which is what most VI users

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:36,790
use is visual mode old VI doesn't have

00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:40,060
that V does file opening stuff so to

00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:42,550
mitigate that there is a library called

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,450
vim pulse it's not any max you have to

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:47,830
pull it down from the max wiki so it's

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,770
pretty much just viper mode with more

00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:55,290
stuff added up on top of it so I'll go

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,290
back here and I don't load it by default

00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:08,590
so now I can go to visual mode I can do

00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:10,600
visual line I can do visual block if I

00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,880
had code folding enabled I can do code

00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,410
voting with zc close with ZCO bonesy oh

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,950
this i found this to be a much more

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:23,680
streamlined experience then p i improved

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:27,640
has added some features that make VI a

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,970
lot simpler to use in this developer

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,790
assemble opinion so next thing out if

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:36,700
you don't like the Emacs keybindings you

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:39,340
can enable the common user act come see

00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,440
you a motor or comedy dracus mode this

00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,890
makes this rebind control Z to undo

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,730
control x to cut ctrl-c to copy and ctrl

00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:52,390
v to paste I use this initially because

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:57,730
I did not really grok the initial d

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:59,140
Emacs Kilrain commands so it's if you

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,520
don't if you don't want to actually if

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,990
you just want to have eMac have the

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,340
customizability of Emacs without

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,470
actually having to do all the

00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,690
special keyboard commands and just want

00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,630
to say have it act like Microsoft were

00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,880
visual studio you can enable CUA mode in

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:19,200
your config file we're actually just CUA

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:24,220
mode 1 ln parenthesis so och tech Wow

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:27,910
spacing sucks low-tech so if so is this

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:30,190
is a superior like tech editing mode the

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,130
most notable feature is that you can

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:36,610
preview actual review your math

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:38,950
functions inside your latency in

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:47,950
sexually inside without rendering the

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:52,480
PDF or BB I so so this little file here

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:54,550
is the quadratic form I still view all

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,650
the quadratic formula I record the

00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,020
command here that's cool so what this

00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:02,050
does here is this is preview preview

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:05,980
lightech at Point or rather preview at

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:09,970
points so if I do do it it'll ask me

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,310
some questions and it will display the

00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,500
result of the of what it would actually

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,140
be visible in the way to end the actual

00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,590
rendered file I can go over it change it

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:23,140
I'd have to rerender it but I found that

00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,840
this is this is I don't use this enough

00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,910
I just these days I just go open and I

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,420
just go rent near the whole entire PDF

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:33,850
again if this fi was the rendering these

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,220
slides all these slides takes good takes

00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,960
a good few seconds if I actually had a

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,030
lot more math this would make it a lot

00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,240
this would make the whole process a lot

00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:47,470
faster this is actually a litec mode as

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,720
opposed to a Stanton suppose opposed to

00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,490
the tech mode that comes with emacs it

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,380
generally gets it generally gets the

00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,150
syntax highlighting right but there's

00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,060
some extra features that awk tech

00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:04,150
provides that are make editing the tech

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:05,500
more less painless so cadet this so

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,450
eventually some people decide to say oh

00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,850
yeah let's go add some bunch of IDE

00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:14,680
features to Emacs and thus was born

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:16,539
cadet it is in Emacs kind of but all the

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,719
instructions for our for a ver

00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:22,869
version that the maintainer czar using

00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:24,189
themselves and s not and it's not the

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,749
one in emacs the functioning is are

00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:28,599
completely different you have to

00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:30,640
download this 15 mega white blob of know

00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,919
maybe it's like towards more megabyte

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,859
compressed blob of zip extract it

00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:37,449
compile it install it and add to all

00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:42,549
three little paths and to actually use

00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:43,929
this I did not set this up it's quite

00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:45,729
complicated there are some more

00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:48,009
lightweight features I want to go talk

00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:50,469
about later but this gives you full

00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:52,509
semantic parsing within with this whole

00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:55,089
intelligent and tell us anything that

00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:57,699
visual studio has is so you can make

00:38:55,089 --> 00:39:01,539
projects you can generate elaborate code

00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:04,779
templates you can create and create a

00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:07,469
few uml diagrams it looks it looks

00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:10,419
pretty powerful but I have simply never

00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:14,469
gotten around using it or by the pellet

00:39:10,419 --> 00:39:17,439
using it so I'll complete mode so this

00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:21,519
is this is a much simpler version of the

00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:23,169
intellisense that's in a cadet you can

00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,489
tell it to go look at tags you can tell

00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:26,380
go to look at text in the fog you can

00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:31,319
tell with a look at other file other

00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:37,209
file pass so let's go to my other file

00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:40,259
here so this is a see file that has two

00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:43,089
functions too long has really long names

00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:47,169
so I want to make a function this is

00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:50,609
called do stuff so that does that cause

00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:50,609
these two functions so

00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,450
so these folks is real long normally I

00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:09,550
we just have to write the whole thing

00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:09,550
out but now I can if I enable at first

00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,360
it says do I want to do awesome

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,310
something in toward you want to do

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:27,650
awesome stuff with the float so I can

00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:30,830
select that and I can do it to make

00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,020
suggestions you can go there come in its

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,700
makes this makes renewing with all those

00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,310
long functionings like the ones found in

00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:41,660
G live a bit easy to deal with you got

00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:50,030
the tag first but that's that I have

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:52,850
actually yes I believe you can yes you

00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:55,310
can if I mod an exactly configured to

00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:58,120
use tags generally the in fought the you

00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:00,470
can't Elvis search all open buffers Oh

00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,410
repeat the question he was asking about

00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:06,020
whether the commands were whether this

00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:07,420
applies to the tags would apply anything

00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:11,300
work with anything it could be tagged

00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,430
yes anything as far as i can tell i have

00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,080
not used it because i have not gotten

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,770
around figuring it or have that he

00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:22,010
headed really any need to do do so yet

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:24,650
so the next thing I got for you is this

00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:28,790
is this snippet extension it's pretty

00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:32,420
much a bunch of small code snippet that

00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:34,220
you can expand by pressing tab so if I

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:37,220
will go back here and want to make a

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:40,160
main so I can just type in the main you

00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,640
press tab and it pulls the main function

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:47,000
out of space fo onto a for loop pulls a

00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:50,780
40 template out of space you can switch

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,690
through them by pressing tab it

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,980
remembers where you are and snip it will

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,750
X in this case typical exit in the

00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:02,900
middle so 5 and it goes back to their

00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:05,780
you can do again and you can even embed

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,250
thumb a me out like that but you can

00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,840
definitely there's ways to embed

00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,720
snippets and size snippets and size net

00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,640
bits and snippets

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,349
Oh next we have a nice HTML mode

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,810
remember how I said that emac you can

00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:21,910
only have one major mopar buffer this

00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,410
gets in the way for things like web

00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:27,670
development when you want may want to

00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:29,830
bed javascript in htn HTML in this case

00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,480
if you it would just be HTML you would

00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:34,150
try to JavaScript inside a script tag

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,930
and it would try a syntax highlighted

00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:42,280
like HTML you don't want that so what

00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:44,950
this guy tried to do is it tries to say

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,420
he made a library that adds multiple

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,010
major mode support it's just a major

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:52,210
mode that can go switch route between

00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:54,790
other major modes attendant it works it

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:57,300
works well in some cases the hot syntax

00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:00,690
highlighting is a little weird and the

00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:04,540
packaging weights package this is also a

00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,460
humongous wallet emacs lisp that is hard

00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,490
to actually install on a unix system i

00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:14,320
believe the guy does it the developer

00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:16,570
runs windows but it it works i

00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,599
personally do not like it too much

00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:24,310
because it's hard to install and handle

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:27,450
but is this solves this solves that web

00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:31,050
dev web development problem so org-mode

00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:34,540
org-mode is the scariest thing in Emacs

00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:36,040
it's just a point just a way to up do a

00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,880
bunch of nodes project planning

00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,700
authoring to-do lists etc and what

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,800
really makes us crazy as below is that

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:49,750
it can be exported that you can there

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:53,140
are ways to export org-mode org files to

00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:55,570
HTML or litec actually there's a way to

00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,820
make slides like this inorg mode

00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,770
translate the litec and then you can

00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:08,130
paulo attack and you've used or go to

00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:08,130
make slides it's really nuts so let's go

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,920
so this is a little thing I made up so

00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,330
this is org-mode I explained and expand

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:21,339
the subheadings with tabs and it's crazy

00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:23,200
yeah so I think I gave you a reason why

00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,650
it was crazy if I could export to

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,339
everything so i can say that

00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:31,160
done with ctrl c ctrl T it's done this

00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:35,660
is all plain text that it parses and

00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,940
collapses immediately and I can cycle

00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:42,500
actually cycle through it no nothing to

00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:45,079
do to do we're done Ozil stuff many many

00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,079
levels it's generally used for

00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,410
organization but I'm old-fashioned I do

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,950
planning in something like this I like

00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:56,630
these things and there's a reason why

00:44:54,950 --> 00:45:00,950
it's crazy but there's nothing under it

00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:05,420
it's the the subtrees are indicated by a

00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:08,029
black ellipsis on the end so let's go

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,829
back again there's also a bunch of other

00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:13,069
editing modes this is an exactly cool

00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,569
but occasionally you will try and it's

00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:17,390
something that want to edit a file that

00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:18,230
isn't supported by default in Emacs and

00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:21,010
you might have to go a little treasure

00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:24,410
hunt to find the major boat for that

00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:27,200
unfortunately it has that settle down

00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,250
all the by all the syndics Eiling frame

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,400
which every single thing you'd ever want

00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:34,670
to do is already in them to get stuff

00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,950
like Haskell it would have to go find a

00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:38,690
haskell mode to do PHP of all things you

00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,089
think there would be a PHP mode in Emacs

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,390
but there's not for some reason so you'd

00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:49,180
have to go pull it down from the max

00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:49,180
wiki which I will talk about again later

00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,890
yes I want to put in might want to put

00:45:54,799 --> 00:46:01,279
PHP in there so you'd have to use that

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:03,289
and it's an XHTML stuff to do that and

00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:04,910
get highlighting for it will still but

00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:08,390
she'll still what you type it in it'll

00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:10,220
just be confused so now I get to go to

00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,680
all the cool stuff is not related text

00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,690
editing and the first thing you might be

00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,460
wondering is I'm doing this presentation

00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:22,940
Emacs right yes I am there is an entire

00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,579
mode dedicated to viewing PDFs what it

00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:28,539
does is it runs ghostscript and all the

00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,829
pages in the PDA in the PDF and

00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:32,990
comparison the PNG images which are in

00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:35,900
turn displayed within any max buffer

00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:38,380
thus you who's all the little metadata

00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,560
information and

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,060
it's gonna be a bit slow and there's no

00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,190
way to actually tell it to go fill up

00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,290
the entire screen i had to guess at the

00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,390
number that would make this make it fit

00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,240
here and there is no way to Center it

00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,770
but it's effective the only way I

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,570
actually figure out that it existed was

00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,220
because I accidentally opened a PDF file

00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,350
when I was doing some editing with tech

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:06,250
and it opened it and I was rather

00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:13,240
shocked yeah was like oh actually I can

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:17,340
I can view the binary oh no why are

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,340
you.why re-rendering all of the pages

00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,450
okay now i have to go all that was not

00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:28,150
anticipate i'll go all the way back to

00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:31,240
where i was sorry about that oh yeah

00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:34,840
there's that so there is IRC clients MX

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,790
has to IRC clients that's actually what

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,200
that a little pound signs Air Force says

00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,810
there's some activity in another

00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,970
activity in one of the windows I have

00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:54,580
open so let's go back to that other

00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:59,850
frame let's go to the this is erc so i

00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,850
can go i can type things

00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:18,839
yeah there's a lots of features this is

00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:21,509
this is there are many extension modules

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:24,180
for this the one thing that kind of gets

00:48:21,509 --> 00:48:26,039
me is it just says erc I don't always

00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,660
look look at the bottom of this year see

00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,089
that this journalist hyperlinks best

00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,489
some as I wanted to be like RC and have

00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:34,380
the name there's a way to do that too

00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:36,779
there's a way to make this thing stick

00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,640
stick on the bottom one thing that

00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:41,130
really bothers me about this though in

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,670
emacs client mxr sequence in general is

00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:50,400
that this is the order of the names that

00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:53,190
comes down from the server itself which

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,499
can but it's not in any particular order

00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:59,069
in order to find someone yet walkthrough

00:48:55,499 --> 00:49:01,739
although more try tab complete and it

00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:04,049
just gets it just gets in my I just want

00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:06,599
you to be annoying i found no simple way

00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:13,380
of doing that without modeled without

00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:16,920
making some new list function Oh yep

00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:19,920
let's go back to some let's go back to

00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,509
this Andy max of course has email

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:28,920
clients I don't use email and emacs I

00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:32,069
didn't really a get I in really I'm

00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,989
really get why it's necessary to use

00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,489
mail and emacs but there are male and

00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:37,200
news clients for you max there's

00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:38,369
actually more than one of them there are

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,059
some differences between them I have

00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:44,339
never actually used one myself simply

00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:46,289
and apparently to set them up you need

00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:49,079
us go make some more Lisp set some more

00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:51,900
variables and then in the end hope it

00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:54,869
works but they reportedly do work well

00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:59,880
and are well integrated into the eng max

00:49:54,869 --> 00:50:02,849
as a whole so next we got the doctor so

00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,890
if you're feeling down and you want to

00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:06,299
get sand you feel like the world's

00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:08,640
crowing down upon you you can go it's

00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:13,050
gets e you can use your own personal

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:20,280
doctor in Emacs so

00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:21,570
next dr. spell yes you are the

00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,670
psychotherapist please describe your

00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:30,780
problems okay and it's still and beat

00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:46,080
then all right so the bus so Viper still

00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:48,540
applies here so yeah why do I

00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,340
it'll-it'll constantly ask you that a

00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:57,900
lot why you say that why do you say that

00:50:50,340 --> 00:51:00,330
why do you say that yeah bye doctor so

00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,920
next we got terminals now you never have

00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:07,590
to leave you Maxie max has its own

00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:15,990
terminal polyfunctional terminal I can

00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:19,620
list files I can do I can see how big my

00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:24,510
e max max study is eight point three

00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:25,680
megabytes this is a pretty mostly this

00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,390
is a pretty functional term it's not

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,670
completely functional there are some

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:32,430
things that don't work I've tried to run

00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,860
screen in this and scream or sea and

00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:39,090
screen it doesn't work large amounts of

00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:40,770
Io slow it down incredibly I personal up

00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:42,060
during people who use you make sure and

00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:48,240
I recommend using something like an X

00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:50,190
term or arc CT or some other yeah your

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,140
question is can you run Emacs in even

00:51:50,190 --> 00:52:02,730
run emacs and emacs the answer is yes

00:51:52,140 --> 00:52:08,370
you can also run them in Emacs it does

00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:11,130
have a text editor probably but there's

00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:14,240
a there's a web browser in Emacs it's w

00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:18,300
it's dubbed it snot actually an emacs

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,970
but it's w.e its w3m you can download it

00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:24,240
install it it's just another one of

00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:26,700
those things that I never really used

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,720
oh yeah yeah yeah you could put yet dumb

00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:33,150
you almost definitely run links in here

00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,590
so the daemon so what they're all these

00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,600
things these days generally have if you

00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,960
have a humongous program you Gavin you

00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:42,870
have an auto starter so the emac so

00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,330
Emacs has its own little Damon that you

00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:49,290
can run it opens up unix socket you can

00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:53,610
go and connect to it using Emacs clients

00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:55,590
or in addition you can go to run server

00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:57,840
start run with uni max this is nice

00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:59,970
because the startup so you can open and

00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,710
close emacs find really quickly as

00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,420
opposed to having to wait the few

00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:07,890
seconds it takes for remax alone all by

00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:10,920
configuration next we got color themes

00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:12,990
so Emacs is not it is not native Lethe

00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:18,030
mobile all themes really are just a

00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:20,790
collection of faces so what all right so

00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,920
what you can do is you'd have it's not

00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:25,920
in Emacs to the moment but the wise

00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,390
people I zmax developers said we must we

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:45,120
should add this because people have been

00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:48,270
using it so much so do I where I was

00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,100
talking about cockiness ok call us so

00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:54,770
there's there's a bunch of color theme

00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,770
initialization functions one of them

00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:02,940
is actually it's here color theme

00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:04,980
selects so you're gonna have all little

00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:12,180
color themes in emacs you can go look at

00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:14,670
them you press Enter or go away Viper

00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,230
you get in my way you can press ENTER

00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:18,540
and it'll set it'll just go switch

00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:25,170
between them you can preview tons of

00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:30,750
color themes now all of them are good on

00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:32,070
the eyes this is the one I use it

00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:36,030
doesn't help but the projector is the

00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:37,800
dark it looks a lot better on here so in

00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,300
the end one of the things I think of the

00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,970
car thing is color themes it's hard to

00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,680
change the change every change it so you

00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:46,830
can just go reset and everything's back

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,650
normal so there's also a bunch of games

00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:51,240
by the time I would show you Tetris but

00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,650
you can do MX Tetris and play Tetris and

00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:56,670
emacs there's also a bunch of other

00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:58,950
games it's in the menu resources or

00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:03,270
emacs tutorial in Emacs control HT

00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:04,680
there's these links the tour is where

00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:07,410
actually I got a lot of information the

00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,839
wiki is awesome the good way to start up

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,490
the start configuring Emacs is to use

00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,339
the emac starter kit that Tecna man

00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:17,369
seemed made it's a lot cleaner than my

00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:19,440
config that i can get and blinky too if

00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:20,520
you want and just Google in general it's

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,290
just it'll probably link you to the

00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:27,080
Emacs wiki but it is definitely

00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:30,740
definitely helpful so that is it

00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,740
anything for anything for me

00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,280
yeah I had to mix actually

00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,700
what about this I can help the like it

00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:04,740
we have the same problem what would

00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,740
happen a few years you gave me I found

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,020
let's put the word out

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,020
you

00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:25,680
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,240
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,190
cloud is just the next generation of

00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,170
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:33,120
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,290
we're in a unique position to really

00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,420
help bring these two worlds together

00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:38,730
these different sets of technologies and

00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,070
to help companies embrace this new world

00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:43,080
in this great new tool that allows

00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:45,660
faster innovation not only is it about

00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:51,060
us being responsive and accountable but

00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:53,900
it's about us doing more for you webos

00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:57,450
