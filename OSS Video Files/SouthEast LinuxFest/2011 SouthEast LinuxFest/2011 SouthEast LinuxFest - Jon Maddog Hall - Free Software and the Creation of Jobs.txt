00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:07,920
some time to time while i'm setting

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:13,740
things up oh my god see there it is

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:24,840
again the beam of light you know whoa is

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:26,340
that annoying look the other way dog

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,299
stocks wait a minute wait a minute okay

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:35,360
no tux ducks wow that's the deal you're

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,100
not going to be on the whole time is it

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,100
and it probably isn't

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,900
I was telling the guy who was up here

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,479
with helping me with my notebook that

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,479
this is the first new notebook I

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,229
purchased in about six years my previous

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,200
one was an IBM thinkpad x30 one and that

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,270
just did me a you know very very good

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,820
service for six years as I went around

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,189
the world it was dropped and bumped and

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,269
you know all that type of stuff it was

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:12,540
like a tank but as a lot of other things

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:15,030
over time it kind of lost some steam and

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm working on a new project which I'll

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,130
tell you a little bit about today but

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,200
very little bit called Project Kalwa and

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,500
it relies heavily on virtualization and

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,600
of course seven years ago the x31 didn't

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,330
support virtualization that much so I

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,280
recently bought this new notebook also a

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,769
thinkpad this isn't an advertisement for

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,170
them just explaining that is a w510 and

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:42,060
it has seven cores and eight gigabytes

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,810
of main memory and a half terabyte disk

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,750
drive in it and I call it smog after the

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,359
fire breathing dragon of Tolkien because

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,880
when this thing gets going the fan comes

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:57,450
on it sounds like a 747 plane taking off

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,549
you know but it'll allow me to do the

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,570
simulations and stuff I need to do for

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:10,230
this project so so I'm here setting up

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:12,680
small C we still got about two minutes

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,680
left

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,850
I was actually thinking about starting

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,290
off my talk with a rant and I can do the

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:29,030
ranch right now where we're still

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:31,340
waiting for people to come in well well

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,720
we won't we I'll do the rant and then

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:40,700
you can introduce me and I'll going with

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:43,820
the talk okay here's the rant this is a

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,190
phone supposed to be easy to use I

00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,310
remember when they were easy to use okay

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:55,250
but the other day my phone mysteriously

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:57,860
stopped working and so i had to find the

00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,770
website that was going to help me fix my

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,330
phone and of course when that website it

00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,739
had a telephone number you could call

00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,290
which I couldn't do because my phone

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:11,720
didn't work so i had to find another

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,950
phone to call them and I called them up

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,600
and they said the first thing you said

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,690
to me are you calling from the phone

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,100
you're experiencing problems with no you

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,200
idiot it's broken so I finally get this

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,310
very nice person on the line who you can

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,070
tell is reading this script okay hello

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,910
we're sorry you're having problems turn

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,669
page you know would you turn off your

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,050
phone and take the SIM card out of it no

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:42,229
I don't think that's the problem you see

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,940
take the SIM card out of it and whether

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,830
web pencil race no I don't think that's

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,960
the problem because I can see go don't

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:52,250
you know i'm reading from my script sir

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,050
please don't interrupt me okay two hours

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,810
later we finally got the end of the

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,430
script i said you know i could see the

00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,990
carrier name i used to work for the

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,000
telephone company I have a master's

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,320
degree in computer science I have 40

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,970
years of experience in the field I've

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,080
written the operating system that goes

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,880
on your stinking bone and I can see that

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,380
the carrier's name is on there a gnd

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,550
that means the radio is working that

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,000
means the sim card is working at means

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,710
all that stuff is working now I asked

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,510
you two hours ago if you would just

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,220
check on my account to see if for some

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,040
reason you have turned off my account

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,470
would you please do that Oh sir

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,810
somebody called us and told us that they

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:35,650
lot that you had lost your phone and we

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,720
turned off your service I see would you

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,940
turn it back on well sir we can't do

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,460
that for you because we don't know that

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:50,260
you're you so you have to travel two

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,210
hours north to the AT&T store so it show

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,090
them ID so that we can give you a new

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,360
sim card because we think we've damaged

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,610
your old one so I had to do that and

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,560
then when I got up there I said to them

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,840
let me get this straight somebody called

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,460

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,670

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,700
service and now i have to i but without

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,100
service for two days and i had to travel

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,480
up here at four dollars a gallon for

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,130
gasoline and my time and everything else

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,360

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:27,910

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,910
of my talk I'm going to prove to you

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,460
that we as a society have been going

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,170
downhill in terms of service and I'd

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,340
like to propose something to change that

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,990
and with that I'd like to turn it over

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,700
to the organizers that they could

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,760
properly introduce me and tell me who I

duration of the conference they will

you keep it and take it home so we would

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,060
like that back anyway without further

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,250
looking awkward up here next to Mad Dog

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,410
this is the godfather of Linux this is

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,410
john Mad Dog home thank you very much

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:22,830
okay i'm going to be talking about free

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:24,930
software and the creation of jobs now

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,960
I'm going to warn you folks this is a

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,550
highly opinionated talk the other day i

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,680
was seeing the speaker's room when I

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,440
came out with a number and somebody said

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,959
we did you get that number from well I

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,969
gave them a reasonable approximation of

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,519
how I got the number and stuff like that

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,680
but I'm not going to have all the facts

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,110
and figures of stuff in this talk they

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,699
have so anybody out there that wants to

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,920
meet me afterwards it's an arm-wrestle

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:53,339
about it you're welcome to the faint of

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,170
heart you're welcome to leave and the

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,190
second thing is there's no magic here

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,399
there it ever is Magic has gone two days

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:06,779
of heavy Potter I think somebody is dead

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,480
but we it's just a lot of hard work we

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,940
all know what that is so don't look for

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,110
a magical thing and i'm going to say and

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,149
you're all going to go off and start

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,880
making money with free software but and

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:21,870
a lot of you are going to say i already

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,910
knew that and that's okay because my job

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,420
isn't necessarily to teach you something

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,970
completely new my job is to remind you

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,160
of the stuff you may already know and to

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,620
bring it from the back of your head to

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,050
the front of your head so when you go

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,699
back to your boss or your employees or

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,350
something like that you might be able to

00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:43,620
use a little quip that i've told you or

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:47,970
something to illustrate the points i'm

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,730
going to make okay now I've been around

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,339
for a long time I came into the

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,339
commercial computing industry in 1969

00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,550
started to I read a book called

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:02,970
programming the IBM 1130 and Fortran and

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:07,140
that's how I learned programming in 1969

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,300
in practicing one and of course and I've

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,370
been alive a wide variety of different

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,620
jobs have been a program or been a

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,899
systems administrator but most

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,660
importantly I've been a customer who's

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,480
been sitting there waiting for that bug

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,220
fix or that enhancement or whatever to

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,819
come from the people going to create it

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,999
and I've been a vendor who's been trying

00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:32,699
you get that bug fix enhancement out to

00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:34,470
that particular customer so I've been

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,559
both sides of it I know that there's

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,179
pain on both sides I'm a little cartoon

00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,119
at the bottom if you can't quite read it

00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:44,309
that's a Dilbert cartoon it shows the

00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,839
sky with a really big head that says I

00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,809
have all the job requirement you're

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,419
looking for I have an IQ of 300 several

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:54,149
Nobel prizes and two centuries of unix

00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:57,799
experience thanks to time machine and

00:10:54,149 --> 00:11:01,229
the immortality drug that i invented and

00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:06,179
cat bird to evil HR Director says that's

or is it just just stand up yeah you

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,609
with a fly swatter thank these are

00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:28,470
people at a little company and say these

00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:30,600
are people little company and their

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,619
little company has been using all free

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,220
software you know linux and open office

00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:41,220
and stuff to do their work now you just

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,039
hired a new CTO and they came in and

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,169
they're a real Microsoft fan okay and

00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,429
they realized they say hey we don't want

00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:49,470
to use all this open source stuff

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,779
anymore we want to use stuff that our

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,850
customers use so we're going to go out

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,279
and we're going to buy a whole series of

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,039
Microsoft licenses for the computers

00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,119
that we have but you know something we

00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,579
don't really have the money in the

00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:04,769
budget to do that so we're going to have

00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:08,309
to lay you off so will you sit down

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:10,259
thank you sir you sit down and oh by the

00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:12,389
way that open office stuff that's not

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,429
that good you know we want to have real

00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:17,809
microsoft office in here so sir would

00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:20,669
you please sit that thank you and we

00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:24,479
want to have oracle in here not that

00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:27,899
postgres SQL thick now when I started

00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:30,749
into computers I had a master's degree

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,600
in computer science what was computer

00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:35,939
science of the day and the person

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,100
sitting next to me also had a master's

00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:40,470
degree or maybe even a PhD in computer

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,960
science so if I had a pet

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,400
question we could talk it between us we

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,230
couldn't figure it out we turn to the

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,460
person to the left of me who also had a

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:53,490
masters or PhD computer science but then

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,490
after a while all the support health

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,830
started to be located in the computer

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:02,940
center which was a couple floors down

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:05,580
and then all of a sudden it started to

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,590
come from the supplier because the

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,750
supplier was the one who created the

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,810
programs they were the ones who actually

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,220
knew how the program's work you had to

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,440
call them up to get your support and

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,110
then because the suppliers felt that

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,840
that was inefficient they started to

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,530
create telecentres and levels of support

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,960
and so you now have to call these people

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,750
to get your answers to your questions

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,720
and then finally all this was too

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,570
expensive so they decided to offshore it

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,860
and send it other places even further

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:47,370
away now this was all being done because

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,950
of two groups of people number one the

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,660
people that were producing the support

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,690
because they want to make it more

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,300
efficient lower costs and everything

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,570
else and the people who were buying the

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,670
support who is not the end user the

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,760
people buying support were typically

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,950
purchasing agents who never had to call

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,870
that telephone number they never had to

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,720
sit on the telephone for hours at a time

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,130
they've never had to worry about where

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
they're going to get the second phone to

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,280
call about the first one being broken

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,530
they didn't worry about that because

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,120
they didn't use it they were just

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:26,180
looking for the cheapest possible

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,610
support to say that we had support and

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,010
so the end user who is the only person

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,340
who is actually going to suffer or

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:46,290
benefit from this was out of the picture

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:48,180
now how many of you the other thing

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,160
about the local support the people that

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,110
were still local and they really

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,030
couldn't do anything about it they

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,310
couldn't change the binary applique

00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,950
asian they could offer workarounds a

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,380
little bit they could say I can help you

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,780
try and integrate this binary package

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,020
into your the rest of the software you

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:10,350
have but they couldn't change the actual

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,420
program they could offer education that

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,530
could offer training but they couldn't

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,660
change the actual program so again I'm

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,960
going to go back to the period of 1980

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:26,190
where i actually purchased a piece of

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:29,910
binary only software oh I've stepped out

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,730
of the light i purchased a piece of

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:36,360
binary only software it came on 28 inch

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,070
floppy disk and i purchased it from a

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,940
little company it was very close to my

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,830
house and i said you know i was using it

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,300
and one day i found a problem so I

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,610
called up the company this is a true

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,830
story I called up the company I got the

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,520
president of the company on a telephone

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:56,190
I says hi I'm using your software i paid

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,280
a thousand dollars for it i found a

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,320
problem explain what the problem was he

00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,030
says yeah I know what that is and you

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,820
can say that because he was the chief

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:08,160
programmer of the company he says you

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,490
know I think we could probably fix that

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,700
and we could QA it this afternoon you

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,050
can see that because he was a head of QA

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,490
he says if we do that we could probably

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,260
ship it out and get it to you tomorrow

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,080
morning he could say that because he was

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,030
ahead shipping clerk and sure enough the

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,720
next day I got my two inch floppy disk

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:31,170
back in the mail and it worked that was

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,540
great now this company at that time had

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,000
about a thousand customers and if each

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,000
customer had two problem reports that's

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,510
2,000 pieces of paper coming in to the

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,030
100 engineers that they had and that's

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,890
20 20 reports that each engineer has to

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:51,120
work one over the course of the year no

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:54,150
problem you know easy to do however it's

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,980
now the year 2011 the little company

00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,710
still exists they've grown they have

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,540
about two hundred engineers you don't

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:04,400
pay a thousand dollars for their product

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:07,449
anymore you pay 2995 a compu hut and

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,029
they have 4.5 million customer

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,429
and now when you call them up you no

00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,260
longer get the President on the line no

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,569
do you get the chief programmer no do

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,169
you get the shipping clerk what you get

00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:23,589
is please press button number one for

00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:25,510
sales but number two for support that's

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,449
if you can find a telephone number at

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:35,110
all on the website and then when you

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:39,159
press to you get music music and after

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,919
about 20 minutes you get disconnected it

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:45,070
is not because these companies don't

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:50,309
want to give you good service is because

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:55,120
they can't give you good service okay

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:57,519
now sometimes I talked to thousands is a

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,200
pretty good-sized crowd here sometimes I

00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,010
talked to thousands of business people

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,210
in a room at some place like you know

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,960
context when it was still in existence

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,850
and stuff and I'll do it here how many

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,500
of you have ever had a problem with

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:17,260
closed source proprietary software now

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:22,169
how many of you have actually taken a

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:24,789
time to turn in a well-worded bug report

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,740
now I'll bet that most of you are

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,570
business people and you've taken the

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,340
time to do that because you paid money

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,130
for that software and you actually

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,270
expect it to work properly foolish

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,210
people

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:41,210
now a few people that took the time to

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,100
turn in that well worded bug report how

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,960
many of you have actually gotten back on

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,110
what you do seriously now how many of

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,980
you actually gotten back either a bug

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:58,610
fix or a well-worded workaround for that

00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:00,560
oh that's pretty disgusting isn't it you

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,090
paid money for word you have you bought

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,190
the service and that's the type of

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,320
service you get I did this one time in a

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,210
really large roof with a lot of people

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,950
at a big conference and one person

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,540
raised their hand at the end only one

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,830
person out of the audience is it mr.

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,170
gates you don't count now going to ask

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,390
one more question how many of you people

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,520
have actually had to change the way that

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,920
you do your business because the

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,180
software won't let you do your business

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:36,380
the way you wanted to and how much did

00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,690
that cost you that's the question okay

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:43,070
you'll see this is a reason for these

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:46,220
this madness here now when production

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,650
software and production support started

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:53,330
the number of desktop computers was

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:55,780
relatively few to what we have today the

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:59,150
people that use them were typically

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,280
executives or upper management who were

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,440
using them to get reports of things like

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,210
that they had a fair degree of training

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,760
in various things and it would be sent

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,160
for classes to get more training in

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,470
these things because the desktop

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,800
computers were thirteen thousand fifteen

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,330
thousand dollars and you know it was

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,760
worthwhile to give them the training

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,800
that they needed in these new things

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:26,690
most of these people spoke one of the 50

00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:28,520
major languages of the day okay today if

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,230
you take a look at a bun to of one of

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,540
the other major distributions you'll

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:36,230
find out they support over 200 different

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,270
languages and finally the business

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,160
methods tend to be the same because they

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,710
were developed business methods that

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,130
were developed in North America Western

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,490
Europe things like that it's a little

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,190
bit different if

00:20:48,490 --> 00:21:00,010
are in the Swahili business environment

00:20:51,190 --> 00:21:03,940
he doesn't quite fit today there's 1.5

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:05,860
billion desktop computers any number of

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,800
people might be using them including my

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,929
parents my mother who thinks that virus

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,530
is something you treat with chicken soup

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,150
and then my father who thinks sort of

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,780
backup is something you do with the car

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,210
to put it in a parking place and the

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,640
hardware is becoming incredibly cheap

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,320
the operating system is becoming ever

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,480
more sophisticated but training well we

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,490
don't even talk about that that's

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,040
something you somehow pick up to us

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:41,650
Moses and in a Swahili language the word

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,850
download means to take something off the

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:47,500
back of a truck and put it on the ground

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:51,280
this is the type of problem that we have

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:54,010
today I was a product manager for

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,130
digital unix and during one of our

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,870
releases I made up a list of 650

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,110
different product requirements that our

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:05,110
customers have given us we rank them

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,500
from most important to least important

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,929
of course to the customer all of them

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,059
were important if you turned into five

00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,550
requirement your quad requirement was

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:19,300
the most important one of the whole

00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:21,790
group but not the digital because to us

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:25,600
the most important one was the one who

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:29,320
sold the most computers in any case I

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,559
gave this to my team of engineers 550

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,929
engineers and said how many of these can

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,570
you do in the one-year release cycle we

00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:39,490
have and they studied it for a month and

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,580
they came back and they said we could do

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,030
the top 50 and maybe one or two more

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,330
underneath I say what about the other

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:52,929
600 they said we'll do that in the next

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:56,170
release now if you believe that I have a

00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:57,970
bridge to sell you in New York City okay

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,429
well maybe two tall towers that are no

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,279
longer there because in the next release

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,899
there was always more week

00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:05,820
quirements that had to be done more

00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:08,419
hardware that had to be support more

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:12,269
standards that had became crucial and

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:15,659
your product requirement went further

00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:17,460
down the list and after a while I

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:20,879
stopped making a proj requirement list

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,070
any longer than 120 55 requirements

00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:28,139
because I knew the engineers would never

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:30,989
even look at the ones further down so

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:35,039
here we are this is the functionality

00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:38,099
gap the bottom one is the functionality

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,799
is provided by closed source proprietary

00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,440
software and the top one is the

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:47,429
functionality that typically is needed

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,249
by people that will never ever appear

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:54,960
wherever it does appear it's almost by

00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:58,349
accident and this gap used to be when

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,320
the number of computers was small the

00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:03,719
volume of the difference in the gap

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,619
times the number of computers was

00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:10,739
relatively small but as we increase the

00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:13,259
number of computers as more and more and

00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:17,159
more computers are used this is going

00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:23,909
into human time lost which is becoming

00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:28,019
to be an astronomical number how much

00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:31,200
money is being lost well as I said 1.5

00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,570
billion desktop computers let's say that

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,749
every single one of those computers

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:40,469
causes a loss of perhaps 15 minutes of

00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:42,269
time by its user everyday it might be

00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:44,249
that the person comes in and finds out

00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:46,499
their computer was attacked by a virus

00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:49,080
it could be that they have a lot of spam

00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:52,349
coming into their mailbox it could be

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,059
that they tried to install a new piece

00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,700
of software they screwed up the whole

00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:00,659
thing and now they have to reinstall the

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,309
software again it could be that they

00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,589
bought a new printer they don't know how

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,279
to put it together lots of different

00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:11,190
reasons that could cause this loss of

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,289
time and effort during the day well if

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,110
you say that eat that 15 minutes it's

00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:18,049
worth five dollars let me

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:22,790
as a world economy we're losing 7.5

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:25,070
billion dollars every day that's almost

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:28,640
enough to fund some small war in some

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,799
far east country but this is a world

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,530
economy it's a world number not just the

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,299
United States this but let's take a

00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,580
smaller and easier thing to get our

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,860
heads around you're somebody who's

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,500
running a telecenter or some other type

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,049
of knowledge based company you've got

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,750
300 people working for you and they all

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:50,780
have a desktop computer they each lose

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:53,540
that 15 minutes a day it's like nine

00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,700
people never showed up for work they

00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,830
didn't call in sick they didn't say I'm

00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:02,750
taking vacation they just didn't show up

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:06,740
and you as a manager would be ripshit

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:09,770
about this you'd be really upset that

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,200
these people never showed up but what if

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,770
we took one of those people and train

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,510
them to be a really good support person

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:19,669
somebody that would help people get rid

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,500
of that spam some people help people

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:24,230
give it as viruses install the software

00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,720
forum make the computer easier to use

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,820
make it so that all the person had to do

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,910
was actually sit down and use the

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:35,750
computer now a lot of people say that's

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:38,270
why i buy apple it's easy to use you

00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,850
know that Apple controls everything from

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,790
the software little hardware it's all

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:46,600
integrated I can use it all and that's

00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:50,150
why i buy it well that's true but

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,340
there's a few problems number one if

00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,299
Apple doesn't make it you can't buy it

00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:59,620
and number two you're highly dependent

00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:03,230
upon this one company called apple and

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,570
if Steve Jobs doesn't believe that you

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:10,460
should be doing your work that way well

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:15,080
good luck no hey Steve my biggest ball

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,490
changed the iOS for me click he keeps

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,740
telling me I'm molding my phone wrong

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,390
that's why it didn't work not they

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:25,280
turned off by service I'm holding my

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,470
phone wrong now if you think this

00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,260
numbers these numbers are bad it gets

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,410
worse

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,450
because with a 1.5 billion desktop

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,210
computers today that means that

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,070
basically there's about 4.3 billion

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,070
people who have a selected their

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:44,250
operating system yet and these people

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:48,000
really don't have a lot of training and

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:52,770
education we have they really don't

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,900
speak our languages and the proprietary

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,960
companies can't meet the needs of these

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,620
people the number of engineers they have

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:06,360
is too few the integration is too hard

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:10,770
and it's not profitable for them in Rio

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,960
de Janeiro there is a small company that

00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:18,090
wanted to investigate the rainforest for

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,070
new medicines new materials and things

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,220
like that and they do use some software

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,560
from a company in Canada that produced

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,930
GIS software and this software was

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,820
incredibly expensive now there's two

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,770
types of proprietary software this

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,160
expensive proprietary software and

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:41,850
there's incredibly expensive software

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:45,600
and this is the second one $500,000 a

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:49,800
copy they needed nine copies 4.5 million

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,870
dollars but they had the money the

00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,830
problem was that they only spoke

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:58,770
Portuguese can you imagine people in the

00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,210
world that can't speak English it's

00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,460
incredible these people must have been

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:06,060
incredibly stupid right they're not

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,390
speaking English they weren't they were

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,550
incredibly smart and so they went to a

00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,410
large company I said please for 4.5

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,330
million dollars can't you make a copy of

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:19,350
your software and Portuguese and the

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:25,020
company said no it's not in our best

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:28,620
business interest their best business

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,800
interest not the customers best business

00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:35,850
interests see the problem that's the

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:40,620
problem proprietary software takes to

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:42,130
control away from you you're not in

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,070
control anymore some other

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:50,530
companies in control you're not in

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:52,360
control so the little company went to a

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,810
free software developer and they said

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,670
hey do you think you can create the

00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,170
software we need we don't need all the

00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,640
functionality just need this little bit

00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:05,140
can you do this with open source

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,360
software and the person said yes I think

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,430
I can i'm going to use open G is

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,190
geographical information software as an

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,540
open source project to gather up the

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,760
information I'm going to use the new

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,310
plot to make the maps that you need I'm

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,830
use a postgres SQL to store all the data

00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:23,920
and Python to tie it all together I'll

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,650
make it prompted Portuguese it took them

00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,830
three months he was paid three hundred

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:32,980
eighty thousand dollars plus a monthly

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:35,170
fee to keep the software up to date now

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,930
I don't know how much money you folks

00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:40,060
make but I can't remember the last time

00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,730
I made three hundred a thousand dollars

00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,620
for three months worth of work and

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:48,910
particularly in Brazil this is a very

00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,010
good salary but the reason I mentioned

00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:54,100
this is too we're going to play another

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:57,820
little game here what is the value of

00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,860
this software now some people would say

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,570
the value of the software was three

00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,390
hundred eighty thousand dollars because

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:07,470
that's what the developer was paid how

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,470
many of you agree with that ah

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,740
some people would say the value was 4.5

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,420
million dollars because that's how much

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,460
they would have had to pay the large

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,560
company if the large company had done

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,940
the work and they got in the software

00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:28,210
they would how many people agree with

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:30,280
that at the actual answer is the value

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,910
of this software to the little company

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:37,750
was infinite because without it the

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:39,730
little company could exist and so it's

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:43,330
not the cost of the software that's

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:46,000
important folks it is the value of the

00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:49,020
software and we as an open source

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,380
community have a very bad habit of

00:31:49,020 --> 00:32:00,070
concentrating on the cost instead of the

00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:02,290
value total cost of ownership this

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,850
thing's like how much new hardware

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,770
you're going to have to buy how much new

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,330
software you're going to have to buy how

00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,980
much integration you're going to have to

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,960
do how much is that going to cost you

00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,670
how much education you're going to have

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,950
to do how much is it going to cost you

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,900
would say about the ongoing support how

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,510
much I could have cost you and remember

00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,520
this is all big determined by that same

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,650
person who's sitting there in the

00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,800
purchasing office who's never going to

00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:33,520
use the service at all okay that's why

00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,430
it's a bad idea because enlightens TCO

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,590
enlightens total cost of ownership is

00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:41,350
thinking about things like what is the

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:45,250
cost in the future of upgrading all this

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:47,560
stuff over time what is the cost of

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,480
having to track all these licenses I

00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,460
know companies I have to have two or

00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,970
three people inside the company their

00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,580
sole job is to track licenses because

00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:01,360
they're afraid of having unlicensed

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,790
software on one machine or another what

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,830
happens when you retire the hardware

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,630
because you want to buy upgraded

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,610
hardware for your engineers and stuff

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,000
and now you need to get rid of this

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,800
hardware well under the licenses of most

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,710
closed source proprietary operating

00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,680
system systems you can't simply transfer

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:23,080
the software the person who is going to

00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,620
buy the machine has it by new saw

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,669
we're for it which may not even exist

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,830
how many of you had how many have you

00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:33,240
been able to buy a new copy of microsoft

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:39,190
windows for an old 386 machine lately I

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:42,700
can't do it 486 can't do it ok you get

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:45,190
linux for any one of these and therefore

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:50,409
the machine still has usefulness still

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:54,279
has a value the backup and exchange of

00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:58,240
data is also an issue it also has a cost

00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:00,820
and finally there's the concept of using

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,159
the software for any reason or any

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,340
purpose by any number of people on any

00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:09,129
hard rate you want to all these have

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,020
hidden costs that drive up the total

00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:15,669
cost of ownership in proprietary

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:18,070
software the real thing you should be

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:21,820
looking at though is the value of the

00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:24,250
software can you actually do business

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,129
the way you want to can you actually do

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:29,139
business better than your competitor by

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,869
changing the software and making it

00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:37,899
actually work in a way that gives you an

00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:40,330
edge over your competitor I tell a cute

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:42,629
story about and this is not a true story

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,980
but I think you'll see the value of it I

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:49,030
tell a little story about going down to

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:50,859
a compusa store and buying a CD off

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:53,200
those cheap five dollar racks you've all

00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:55,419
seen them you know buy the CD is filled

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,280
with software you put it on your

00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:59,170
computer system you start to software a

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,450
reputation an hour of the time to

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,420
install it five dollars an hour of your

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,740
time that's the total cost of ownership

00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:10,320
you start to software up it does

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:13,390
absolutely nothing total value is zero

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,950
go back to the story by another CD take

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,730
it home you install it hour of your time

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:20,440
total cost five dollars out of your time

00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:23,440
but you started up and immediately your

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,070
dog you let itself in and out of the

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,230
house by itself your significant other

00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,550
comes home kisses you on the cheek goes

00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,310
into the kitchen makes a fantastic

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,470
dinner comes out stare comes outside

00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,040
grabs you by the hand takes you upstairs

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,460
to bed

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:43,170
make love the entire night believe me at

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,580
the age of 60 that alone is a miracle

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,800
your children come home from school to

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,480
guess three days and the tax collector

00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,160
calls you up the next day says we found

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,650
a mistake in your taxes and we owe you

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,780
two hundred thousand dollars and all of

00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:59,440
it is because of the software on that CD

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,810
I submit to you that that software is

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,000
infinitely valuable to you and you

00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:11,890
really don't care it cost you five bucks

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,940
and an hour of your time this is a

00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,380
business problem now one of the other

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,640
problems we have in the industry today

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:24,550
is people talk about commodity software

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,430
software is a commodity the operating

00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,560
system is unimportant nobody cares about

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,940
it anymore let me tell you something go

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,350
into your window system we move the

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,830
operating system and see how many people

00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:37,210
care about it remove your linux

00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:41,320
operating system see how many people

00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:43,390
care about it okay but let's go with

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,820
this for a moment let's say it's a

00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,030
commodity well let me tell you what a

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,040
commodity is a kabaddi as a Canaccord

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,050
you go to the supermarket that's 15 cans

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,450
of corn kernel corn you know yellow

00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,270
kernel corn sitting on the shelf when's

00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:01,300
food club when's Green Giant Wednesday

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:03,280
Monty one's generic one has one has no

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:06,340
label whatsoever when is slightly dented

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,000
this is all cans of corn all different

00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:12,820
prices now you stay or these cans of

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,620
corn and a guy from the superbark Oh

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,250
services can help you and you say which

00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,420
kids a coin should i buy for my family

00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,710
technics this Canaccord with this kate

00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,170
according the same potter to have to

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,650
have separate pots for them you know

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,540
real really can you give you to help me

00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:31,480
choose which one of these kids of corn I

00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,700
should be PI and by this time the purse

00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,870
is motioning for security guard to come

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:39,130
over and fill you out of there because

00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:41,320
you are a kook as a kind of cord just

00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,150
put in your shopping cart pick the

00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,440
cheapest one they'll all can buy the

00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,150
same company don't go in the same field

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,940
okay

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,670
now this is different than a car because

00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,340
a car is not a can of corn a car is not

00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,650
a commodity you don't take all suitcase

00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:04,360
full of money down to the coat local

00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:06,610
card shop and say here here's my

00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,670
suitcase of money just give me any car

00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:13,360
in a lot you don't do that unless you're

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,250
Larry Ellison or Bill Gates okay and

00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,500
even they don't do it because they want

00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,850
to make sure the car is safe they want

00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,280
to make sure it could tow their boat

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:25,120
well that lets out I mean just no part

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,590
of good Larry Ellison's boat they want

00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,650
to make sure you're all these things

00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:32,200
because a car is not a commodity even

00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:36,280
though every car has gas pedal and a

00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,140
brake and steering wheel or not a

00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,500
commodity and the same thing is true

00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:44,500
about business I have been in the

00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,530
industry for 40 years I have never seen

00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,200
two business problems that were the same

00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:54,940
they're always different they're not

00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,460
commodities so with this track here is

00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:00,030
my round business problem I'm going to

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:03,550
try and treat it with a square

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:05,800
proprietary software solution oops a

00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,230
little bit of round business problem

00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,940
showing through that's okay I'll go back

00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:15,300
to computer store I'll buy another piece

00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:21,970
of square software to help it out oh

00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:24,490
it's not quite working is it hmm I know

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:28,320
what I'm going to do I'm going to buy a

00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:32,140
large piece of software oracle business

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,490
google apps i'm going to buy something

00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,540
like that and i'm going to stick it on

00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:40,300
there and that's going to solve my

00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:43,240
entire problem you know but the problem

00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,550
is it's so big what i really like to do

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,450
is go in and fill way two parts i don't

00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:52,660
want Taylor it down and make it fit my

00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:57,400
actual problem but I can't do that

00:39:52,660 --> 00:40:00,370
because it's closed source the solution

00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,480
has been taken away from me in st.

00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,700
Petersburg Russia

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,200
up there is something known as a turbid

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,850
testbed steam turbines are sent there to

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,670
be put into a situation we could

00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:15,550
actually test the efficiency of the

00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:18,040
turbine there is five of these turban

00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,840
test beds over around the world four of

00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,869
them use closed source proprietary

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:29,650
software one of them in st. Petersburg

00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:32,109
uses open source he uses linux is the

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:35,410
operating system mysql to store all the

00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:38,470
data that he gathers he uses canoe plot

00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,660
to plot out the results patchy web

00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,900
server to distribute it to his customers

00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:46,150
his customers are engineers who are

00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,760
designing the turbines scattered around

00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:53,260
the world and getting their information

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:56,080
about the tests in real time over the

00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,750
internet and every once in a while his

00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,540
customers will say this is great I just

00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,630
need this tiny little change in the

00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:08,250
software and it made the same request of

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:11,170
the proprietary turbid testbed vendors

00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,780
the proprietary people usually take

00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:17,380
about a month to make even the smallest

00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,450
change in the software but my friend in

00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:23,530
st. Petersburg can typically make that

00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:26,350
change overnight who gets the better

00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:30,130
service the people who are using the

00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:34,359
proprietary software or the people using

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:38,590
the free software but what is the value

00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:41,080
of that what is the value to the person

00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:43,119
in st. Petersburg well the person st.

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,880
Petersburg he didn't have to pay for the

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,430
proprietary software he maintains it

00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,780
himself which is something takes time

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:56,470
out of his schedule but most importantly

00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,090
the value to his customers is that they

00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:02,050
can get these changes that they need

00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:07,990
overnight saves them a month of waiting

00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:11,010
for this change so this is why the

00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:14,170
changes and the costs are often subtle

00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,310
it's not a direct money back on a

00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,830
particular

00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:22,090
return on investment or in particular

00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:25,150
cost it may be that you as a provider of

00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,820
services for other people is see other

00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:31,210
people that are actually benefiting from

00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:35,830
it another great example of this is a

00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:38,320
bazillion subway system I met the chief

00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:41,620
of the Brazilian subway system at a free

00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:45,070
software event and he said we don't use

00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:48,610
a lot of Linux in our subway system we

00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:52,080
used mostly Microsoft operating systems

00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:55,590
but I have a lot of office workers and

00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,790
in he meant a lot of office workers and

00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,820
every single one of them was using

00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:03,790
microsoft office at the same time the

00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:08,010
subway was very dirty but I had no money

00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:11,620
in my budget to hire subway cleaners I

00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:14,560
said maybe I could use openoffice to

00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:17,800
write my letters to do my spreadsheets

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,250
and so he switched the Open Office which

00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,920
meant he saved all of the Microsoft

00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:29,280
Office royalties that he had to pay and

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:33,460
he was able to hire 350 subway cleaners

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,200
the subways became a lot cleaner people

00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,240
started coming up to him and saying the

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,460
subways a lot cleaner now i'm going to

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,320
start writing them and not only that but

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:46,120
i'm going to have all my friends ride

00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:49,510
them subway ridership went up revenues

00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:53,410
went up and he had even more money than

00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:56,530
to hire more subway cleaners what he

00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,630
said to me was into 10 years I've been

00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,910
running the Brazilian subways that a

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,560
single customer of mine has come up to

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,920
me and said thank you for using

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,980
Microsoft Office to write your letters

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,650
your letters look so beautiful but they

00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:15,430
did come up to him and say thank you for

00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:19,390
making the subways cleaner so this is an

00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,640
example and of my six people that we

00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:25,950
started at the beginning that means that

00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,950
five of you could now stand back up

00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:36,650
so here is the new old model of

00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:40,730
developing software that it is a service

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:43,430
model which we are familiar with in the

00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:46,310
free software space we're paying for the

00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:49,010
services of copying and distributing the

00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:51,560
software the services of getting the

00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:54,110
features in but when you go to sell

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:59,770
these features to your customers don't

00:44:54,110 --> 00:45:02,420
talk about the cost talk about the value

00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,880
get them to understand that what they're

00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:08,150
paying for is something that is going to

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,510
let them change their business to get an

00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,850
edge over their competitor that software

00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:17,110
is now moving from something which is a

00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:21,290
pure expense to something which has

00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:27,110
strategic value that's what you have to

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:31,640
do and you don't be afraid of the word

00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:33,740
service because a lot of people are they

00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:37,700
think of services people who flip

00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,620
hamburgers or sweep the streets or clean

00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,480
the subways and there's nothing wrong

00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,680
with those jobs it's just I don't want

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:48,580
to do them I think of what we do is the

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,620
same way a service as a brain surgeon a

00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,690
brain surgeon doesn't create a product

00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,810
you don't end up with a second brain

00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:59,840
when they get finished they fix the

00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:03,140
brain you've got and yet you pay them a

00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:06,170
lot of money because they know where to

00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:08,000
make the incision and you don't look for

00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:10,910
the brain surgeon who advertises in the

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,170
paper it says hire me I do brain surgery

00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:18,350
cheap because your brain is very

00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:21,530
important to you well for business

00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:25,010
person their business is more important

00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:26,960
than their brain trust them ask them now

00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:31,130
say okay yeah take my brain I don't care

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,880
but leave my business think about a

00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:37,030
lawyer or don't think about a lawyer

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,320
lawyers certainly don't produce anything

00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,740
but we paid them a lot of money because

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:47,670
we value their expiry

00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:51,360
and their expertise so you can do all

00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:55,619
the things that people currently do with

00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:58,530
closed source legacy software think

00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:04,619
about it to all the people out there

00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:06,960
making money with Microsoft 99.999% of

00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:10,050
them are making money with Microsoft

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,170
because they're educating people and how

00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:16,410
to use it they're installing it they're

00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:18,060
integrating it they're tuning it they're

00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,210
training they're doing all these things

00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:24,540
you can do every single bit of this with

00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:28,580
free software and you have an advantage

00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:31,710
over your clothes source to Patriots

00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,869
because they could never be as

00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:37,320
knowledgeable about the interior

00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:39,330
workings of Microsoft as you could be

00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:43,650
knowledgeable about the interior

00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:47,520
workings of free software you can be as

00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:50,520
good or even better than the people that

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:55,560
wrote that software in teaching about it

00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,420
and maintaining it because maybe the

00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,150
people that wrote the software are

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,859
really good software engineers but they

00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:06,300
always stare at their feet when they're

00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:08,220
talking they have no personal skills or

00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:13,980
you have a better way of communicating

00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:16,619
ideas to the customer than they do there

00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:20,550
their expertise is in writing software

00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:25,859
your expertise maybe in helping the

00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:27,960
customer solve a problem with it the

00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:31,220
only thing you can't do is free software

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,170
is charged an outlandish price for it

00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:37,080
because the mechanisms of free software

00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:39,330
tend to limit how much you can do that

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,330
before somebody else says well and to

00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:45,030
cut you in that price but you can

00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:47,550
certainly be one of the acknowledged

00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:50,840
experts when that piece of software and

00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:53,550
demand a good price for it for your time

00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,150
now here's some tips if you're thinking

00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,650
about

00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,270
going into the free software business

00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,970
I'm sure that we could probably have

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:02,279
appt off on some of these and have come

00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,200
up with others but there's a lot of

00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:06,240
people to say i want to be a free

00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,250
software support person and they try and

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,730
start their own company work by

00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:14,339
themselves you know this is okay a lot

00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:17,640
of people do this but it's really a lot

00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:19,859
of hard work what I recommend is to form

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,589
a cooperative get together with a group

00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:25,740
of like-minded people who perhaps have

00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:29,279
different expertise asst and form a

00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:33,359
cooperative this allows your your

00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:35,760
customers to deal with a company because

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,460
typically companies like to deal with

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,920
companies they're afraid that if you're

00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,140
a lone wolf you might get hit by a truck

00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,420
you may just get tired of doing free

00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:48,270
software and they will be left in a

00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:52,109
lurch but if they're dealing with a

00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:54,630
company as a cooperative they say this

00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:57,089
might be around for a while if you get

00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:59,660
tired of doing it or retire somebody

00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:02,960
else will come in and take your place

00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:06,180
plus in a cooperative you can share

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:09,660
expenses you can hire a couple of

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:12,150
salespeople to go out and do sales you

00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,640
can hire you can share a legal person

00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,349
amongst you know instead of having

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,829
several legal people at different

00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:24,750
companies so a cooperative is a good way

00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:29,339
of forming a business of selling support

00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:32,549
for free software study various business

00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:36,000
models of phos don't think that there's

00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:37,680
just one because as many of them I'll go

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,319
over a couple of them in a couple

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,029
seconds there's the pure service

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:44,309
business model where that's what you're

00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:46,920
doing is selling to a service or you can

00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:49,440
sell a service and product business

00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:52,020
model where you tie together some piece

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,819
of hardware as portion of this it's the

00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:57,420
hardware which you're selling and making

00:50:53,819 --> 00:51:01,849
a little bit of money off of that volume

00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:05,940
is not just a thing it's the only thing

00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:07,250
volume volume volume advertise get your

00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,080
name out there look

00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:13,160
volume everything you think about it has

00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:15,440
to be volume volume is the key word if

00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,560
you can come up with an idea or a plan

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:24,410
that generates that volume your 99% of

00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:25,760
the way there talk to your educators and

00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:31,340
legislators if you've done thatalready

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:35,510
talk to them again now go to the Linux

00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:37,880
magazines go to the corporate sites find

00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:41,990
their linux case studies make up a

00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:45,980
portfolio of theirs break them down so

00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:48,410
that they're under banking retail you

00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,720
know education stuff like that when you

00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,180
go to talk to a customer bring these

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,090
case studies up if you're talking to a

00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:59,510
bank to say do you know to HSBC uses

00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:01,820
linux do you know you know or smaller

00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,700
Bank you know that you know the digital

00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:09,980
credit union uses linux explain why they

00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:13,310
chose it do not be a fanatic be

00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,350
pragmatic okay remember that the

00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,900
customer really doesn't care about free

00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:20,720
software what they care about is saving

00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,300
money and making money if you talk to

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,950
them first about that your 9-10 sottile

00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:31,300
way there it will be hard that's why

00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:33,710
they call it work but it can also be fun

00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,140
I'm going over quickly to business

00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:38,810
models a company in nashua new hampshire

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:42,740
had a huge proprietary closed source

00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:44,690
product project and they were expending

00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:47,600
a lot of engineering time in maintaining

00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:49,910
that they did not have very much time to

00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,500
do innovation because it was paying so

00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,170
much time just supporting what they

00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,510
already had they made the bulk of their

00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,270
software a free and open source project

00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:01,820
gave it away for free exposed all the

00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:05,300
source code develop the community around

00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:08,060
that and the community actually did all

00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:10,910
the work in maintaining it porting it

00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:14,600
and stuff they refocus their engineers

00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:17,990
one tiny little modules that work on top

00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:20,720
of the free software they were able to

00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:23,240
target customers by watching crew

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,820
pulled their free software down if the

00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,619
customer was United States military the

00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:30,260
United States government or General

00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:32,000
Motors they would call him up and say hi

00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,599
we noticed you're using our software

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,130
we'd like to sell you these tiny little

00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:40,750
proprietary modules that go on top of it

00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:43,670
and they made more money than ever a

00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:46,880
friend of mine bought project net a

00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:49,820
close source company they were selling

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,930
two copies of their software every month

00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:57,200
for about two thousand dollars a copy he

00:53:53,930 --> 00:54:00,470
noticed that sixty percent of his

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,590
customers bought a support contract so

00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:06,710
he decided to open up the entire thing

00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:09,380
and give it away for free two thousand

00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:12,830
people a month copied his software down

00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:15,650
for free but sixty percent of them but a

00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:20,840
support contract and he made more money

00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:22,849
than ever these are ideas of different

00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,670
types of business models that you should

00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:28,760
go to of course it's more than just free

00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:31,010
software is the free standards group

00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,570
there's free culture all these things

00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,950
work together I'm told I'm out of time I

00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:39,410
just wanted to mention project tower

00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,720
briefly project cow is a project i'm

00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:44,540
working for in brazil yes you read that

00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:48,500
first bully correctly if it works i

00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:51,770
might be able to produce millions of new

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:55,010
high tech jobs inside of brazil and

00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:59,420
millions more in latin america all in

00:54:55,010 --> 00:55:02,690
the private sector no government money

00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,180
and all these are going to be support

00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,700
jobs where each individual person

00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,740
providing the support is their own boss

00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,900
they own the hardware they're into

00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,720
software they provide the services that

00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:18,109
make the computers easier to use use

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:21,080
less electrical power and all this is

00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:22,700
going to be open source so thank you

00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,560
very much for coming if you'd like to

00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:29,690
see a more about project cowl I'll be

00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:31,970
around we have a site w WR GG org we're

00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:33,640
going to launch this July the second in

00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:38,160
Brazil

00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,160
and that's the site thank you very much

00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:55,810
just wanted to thank you for coming

community really thank you thank you

00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:09,339
along those lines I'd like to make one

up like you did and say that but I want

00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:16,780
to point out if you want to see the most

00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:18,490
important person in free software when

00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:22,260
you get up tomorrow morning you take a

00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,260
look in the mirror thank you

00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:43,040
what about this I can help you like it

00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:46,420
we have the same problem or whatever

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,420
level to do you think

00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:53,270
let's put the word out

00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,270
you

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,790
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,320
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:11,330
cloud is just the next generation

00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,280
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:15,230
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,400
we're in a unique position to really

00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,530
help bring these two worlds together

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,900
these different sets of technologies and

00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:23,180
to help companies embrace this new world

00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,190
and this great new tool that allows

00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,770
faster innovation not only is it about

00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:33,200
us being responsive and accountable but

00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:36,040
it's about us doing more for you webos

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,590
an OS that works the way that you do

00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:43,720
