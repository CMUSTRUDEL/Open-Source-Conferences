00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,060
org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,210
to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:43,129
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:46,969
make these videos possible is the

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:54,300
manager of the global community team at

00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:57,440
red which manages projects such as the

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,640
Prador project and other educational

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:07,930
initiatives like what

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:12,930
child they also help leverage max is

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,930
going to continue on discussion

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:26,490
education why redhead cares about

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:33,090
bringing the open source way open source

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,090
education open education all right thank

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,190
you very much if you want you can clap

00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,970
and i'm done but no clapping at the

00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:45,100
beginning i haven't earned it yet so

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,250
this is sort of part two of kind of the

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,110
two-track little mini education to talk

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,080
mini little education track here and

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,240
greg who spoke just before how many of

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,690
you were here for Greg's talk a pretty

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,190
good number of you so Greg a longtime

00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,640
friend and colleague spent many many

00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:06,159
years at Red Hat a lot of them part of

00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,940
Red Hat's kind of community group before

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,500
he went off to ask me the institute for

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,110
the study of knowledge management in

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,329
education it's been interesting right to

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,680
give you guys a bit of a bit of a bit of

00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:20,739
scope here it's been interesting because

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,269
his focus education is a big place right

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,650
people are getting educated from the

00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:29,290
moment they're born till the moment they

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:34,840
die greg has been focusing a lot on k-12

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,790
education Red Hat has done a few

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,440
different things over the years when it

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,970
relates to open source in education I

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,709
want to start by talking about what some

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,290
of those things are but even before I

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,019
talk about that I want to talk about why

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,959
right and not so much why red hat cares

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:52,410
but I want to first tell you why I care

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,420
and some of those reasons are the same

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,690
the thing that inspires me the most

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,870
about open source and that makes me want

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,760
to work in the industry in the in the

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,010
subset of the tech industry where I can

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,620
participate in open source and Linux and

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,260
things like that is the fact that I

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,000
firmly believe that all of us are part

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,340
of a movement

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,260
has inevitability behind it that is

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,000
already on the right side of history and

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,610
that is going to prove time and time

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
again that a certain set of ideas right

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,530
that we call the open-source way of

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,350
doing things will always be better and

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,450
will always be more successful than

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,580
maybe whatever the incumbent way of

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,290
doing things in a particular area is and

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,030
software is where we've had tremendous

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,770
success with that right over the course

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,180
of the last you know 25 years or so so

00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,850
now the question is about how we

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,980
leverage what we've learned about an

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,230
open-source way of doing things to make

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,209
better software and how we bring that to

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,830
other to other parts of the world and

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,600
and that's part of what I love about

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,700
being in this industry is that I feel

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,800
like you know we're lucky enough to

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,570
think about that problem and to try to

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,060
explore that problem right and one of

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,209
the things that that red hag cares about

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:13,370
I've been at Red Hat about seven years

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:15,530
is making sure that this open-source

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,650
this thing that we call the open-source

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,840
way has the ability to grow just beyond

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,250
that software right so my job at Red Hat

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,380
what is my job at Red Hat what is my

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:30,290
team do part of what we do is attempt to

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,310
codify this thing that we call the

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,110
open-source way the theory of how you do

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,330
things in a community how you bring

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,940
transparency how you allow the best

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,919
ideas to win how you create you know a

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,800
public road map that can be actionable

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,820
by anybody right and how you use that to

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,470
build an end result that has value to

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,780
all sorts of different constituencies

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,490
right and those of you who have wandered

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,990
through the Red Hat ecosystem over the

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,229
years have almost certainly learned

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:04,040
about the Fedora project and that is the

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:09,680
example from a software side of the

00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:11,630
open-source way in theory delivered into

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,440
practice right and that's what we do in

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,470
software it's been very successful and

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,510
that's great so the question that that

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,800
my team is fortunate enough to be able

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,050
to think about is what's the analog to

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,500
that in other areas right

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:34,879
and one of the places that we have spent

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,639
a lot of time is education right and Red

00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,759
Hat's forays into education have taken a

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,970
few different a few different angles but

00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,759
all of them come from this underlying

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,569
principle in this underlying desire to

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,490
make sure that a company like red hat

00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,050
which has a megaphone right and an

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,509
opportunity to speak about the

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,819
open-source way with credibility speaks

00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,440
about it in more places than just

00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,759
software one of the places that we do

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,840
that there's two places that we do that

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,000
that I want to bring your attention to

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,830
one of them is this website called the

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,009
open-source Wade org right this is a

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,500
wiki any of you could come here and read

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,440
it print out a you know a nice little

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,930
PDF of it contribute to it and it talks

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,110
about different things that we've

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,300
learned about organizing and building

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,819
communities with different examples from

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,340
software from Fedora from you know from

00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:30,259
all sorts of things we link to you know

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,669
important books like Carl Fogle's book

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,380
that give more information this is kind

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,599
of a pamphlet it's like a wiki pamphlet

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,990
that talks about the open-source way in

00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,909
theory right in practice redhats got

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,289
this thing called open source com and I

00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:44,330
was saying a minute ago the point that I

00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,130
was trying to make is that one of the

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,840
things we believe in from a branding

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:52,789
point of view is that we have a

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,529
responsibility to share and spread the

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,449
theory of the open-source way into as

00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,190
many places as we can right so open

00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,379
source com is sort of a branding

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,539
exercise and sure it's a branding

00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,279
exercising part for red hat but it's

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,990
also a branding exercise for this

00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,330
generic idea that we call the

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,159
open-source way to try to show people

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,650
how that can apply to business the

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:15,050
government to health to law and near and

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,729
dear to the hearts of several of us to

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,919
education right and we've got you know

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:23,270
all these different articles that talk

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:25,039
about different places where we see

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,469
open-source principles either being

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,819
successful or failing right in the

00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:35,539
education space so that is some of what

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:37,159
we are doing at that high level now

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,009
let's think about some of the actual

00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,540
projects that red hat maybe is thrown

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,190
itself in

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,880
to overtime and it's going to get us to

00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:50,230
what the current project is right Greg

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,270
actually was talking earlier about a lot

00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,310
of the work that he did with the one

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,040
laptop per child community right and he

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,760
was one of the people sort of pioneered

00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,640
red-hats forays into education starting

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,290
with that project right and redhat spent

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,330
a lot of time and a lot of engineering

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,600
effort trying to help make one laptop

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,980
per child successful I would argue to

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,720
you that one of the great things that

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,870
came out of one laptop per child was the

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,070
entire netbook industry you know so I

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:24,850
you know probably billions of dollars of

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:26,980
hardware innovation and by the way you

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,400
know a lot of kids also got their hands

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:34,380
on the actual OLPC XO and were able to

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,580
begin to learn you know faster and

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,800
differently than they would have ever

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,970
had the opportunity to do so and that

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,030
was all great but we had to make tough

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,710
choices right the team at Red Hat that

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,870
has the luxury of thinking about these

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,690
sorts of things like education is a

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,000
small team to begin with and you know

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,090
one and a half people on that team

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,770
actually have the ability to focus on

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,750
education so the choice that we have

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,270
made over time at Red Hat is to try to

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,120
focus on higher education right and why

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,650
is that well a hundred thousand you know

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,470
we looked at some stats from the from

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,670
the ACM and I Triple E and the best that

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,800
we can figure there's something like a

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,610
hundred thousand computer science

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,870
degrees software engineering degrees

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,930
given out in the United States every

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,930
year how many of you are in a position

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,960
where you are either hiring or working

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,130
with new graduates who are just out of

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,890
college with any sort of computer

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:37,510
science skills okay I'm going to ask you

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,300
a question you can speak loudly and then

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:44,020
I'll repeat it to the microphone how

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,430
much knowledge and experience are the

00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,710
people that you are coming in contact

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,330
with who fit that description how much

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,240
knowledge experience do they bring of

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,370
open source methodologies of having

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,680
worked in any real open source project

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,440
or with large code bases and with large

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,890
groups of people on anything real how

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,380
are people doing we got zero in the back

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,839
we got a horrible right here thumbs down

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:29,589
over there has anyone had a successful

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:31,870
case even one okay yes okay so we have a

00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,460
couple sort of success cases we had very

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,770
people very quick to say that people

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:41,950
coming out of school it didn't have that

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:44,260
sort of experience Red Hat and trusts me

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,000
from time to time with hiring

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,220
responsibilities with being part of

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,860
interview teams engineering department

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:55,960
other departments it's something that we

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,910
worry about a lot right speaking for

00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,760
myself I would love to see red hat be

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,940
able to hire so many more new graduates

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,880
than it actually does but part of the

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,240
problem is that the sort of engineer

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,459
that we can drop into you know the Red

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,550
Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora code

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:17,620
bases and not have them you know lose

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,170
the respect of their peers and just

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,940
drown underneath the massive amount of

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,550
stuff that they have to do those sorts

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,320
of engineers only exist after they've

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:31,870
had several years of experience working

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,450
in these communities right and people

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,440
aren't coming out of college ready to

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:40,570
dive right in we've seen some success

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,400
cases in fedora and this is part of the

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,120
value that Fedora provides to Red Hat

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,709
right is not only a pipeline of

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,290
innovation right it's not only the open

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:52,270
research and development lab that allows

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,709
innovation to exist that can go into red

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,450
hat enterprise linux or going to

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,970
anything else from anybody who wants to

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,430
take advantage of fedora but Fedora also

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,990
represents a recruiting pipeline and not

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,390
only for red hat but for any company

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,540
that needs people who have open source

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:12,269
experience I've got three in

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,889
working on my team all of them were

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,110
doing stuff for fedora when they were

00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:19,240
still in high school because they were

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,829
too smart for their class they were

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,660
bored by what they were learning right

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:24,220
Greg mentioned earlier the biggest

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,560
problem that we see in schools is that

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,730
kids are bored right they were bored by

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,470
what they were learning they already

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,930
knew everything that was trying to be

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,199
taught to them on computer day every

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,579
other Thursday and the only place where

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,579
they were able to find any sort of

00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:43,899
intellectual excitement was an

00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:47,800
open-source land right and we had 15 16

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:50,560
year-old kids who made contributions to

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,449
you know the translation effort that

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,639
goes on the front page of Fedora project

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:57,750
org that millions of people were seeing

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,300
and using and that is an opportunity at

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,730
age 16 or 17 guy named Ricky did that

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,589
it's an opportunity that normally is

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,509
only reserved for someone who has

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:10,029
already graduated from school gotten a

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:11,500
job you know I've been told by their

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,779
boss while the project we want you to

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,730
work on is you know figuring out how our

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,040
webpage can be translated into different

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,050
languages right the thing we've learned

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,709
right that that sort of bucks the trend

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,240
of the classic education system which

00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:27,790
says first you have to learn a bunch of

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,260
stuff and then maybe we'll tell you that

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,670
you're certified in those things you've

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,130
learned and then you can go out and try

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,560
to do some stuff right open source turns

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,240
out on its head and it says you can try

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,800
to do anything you want and you can

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,660
learn everything you need to know kind

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,720
of while you do it so the choices that

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,300
red hat is trying to make around how it

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,180
where it picks how to influence this

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,550
gigantic world that is education right

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,040
is attempting to do so in the in the

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,310
university level because what i want to

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,899
say is the day where every university

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,029
student who gets a computer science

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,880
degree walks into their first job

00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,829
wherever that happens to be and if they

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,329
don't see open-source principles if they

00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,550
don't see this thing that we call the

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,620
open-source way that theory if they

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,569
don't see that being done in practice

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,910
already in the place where they're

00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:21,590
working i want that to be you know as

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:25,010
anathema to them as if they

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:28,340
were asked to you know do all their work

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,080
only using Doss or code you know or use

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,170
punch cards to create their program

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:38,090
right I want proprietary software and

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:41,240
everything that goes along with that to

00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:43,370
just you know to be seen as wow you are

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,070
this is a completely backward place

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,020
right so that next generation will swoop

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,910
in having learned about open source

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,820
having experienced open source from

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,310
early on in their education and bring

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,710
that change right which eventually

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,120
raised that tide raises all the ships of

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,130
everyone who cares about open source

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,440
whether you're a company like red hat

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,150
whether you're an individual trying to

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,770
you know build your own career and make

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,990
sure that the skills that you have an

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,540
open source are properly valued in the

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,650
industry right I'm probably preaching to

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,300
the choir a little bit but but that's

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,900
kind of that that's that that that's

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,330
that's an attempt to at least position

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:30,200
why we at Red Hat are trying to focus on

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:32,000
higher education so we talked about the

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,740
theory of the open-source way we talked

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,460
about in software that theory being

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,440
translated through among other things

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,650
the Fedora project to give the Red Hat

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,060
example into a community of

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,930
collaboration and of productivity right

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,280
so on the education side we try to move

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,600
from strength to strength right we've

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,130
identified this thing called the

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,990
open-source way we know how to build

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,240
communities we built a fedora community

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,790
that created some good results so how do

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,240
we mimic that on the education side so

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:07,010
we created this thing called teaching

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,770
open source and and I should be careful

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,050
when I say we even because the guy who

00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,690
registered this domain name is a

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:19,520
professor at Seneca College in Toronto

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:20,900
Canada named chris tyler and i want to

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,370
talk a little bit about what chris is

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,610
doing and what his school is doing

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,620
because it's very very interesting right

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:31,490
one of the problems let's talk about

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,750
problems for a minute one of the

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:37,050
problems that I see

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:40,110
in the Fedora project and I and I think

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,590
it exists in many large open source

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,390
projects is that we spend a lot of time

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:48,030
talking about how important it is to

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,500
bring new contributors in and to bring

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,420
them in in a way that sets them up for

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,370
success right we spend lots of time

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,380
talking about mentor and we spend lots

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,210
of time wringing our hands and saying

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,460
that we don't have enough mentors we

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:04,069
spend lots of time trying to figure out

00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:06,959
if we can even clearly articulate simple

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,170
immediately actionable tasks that

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,600
someone can do successfully in a few

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,370
hours or in a weekend where they can

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,589
immediately see the payoff of that task

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,620
and feel like wow I made a contribution

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,780
that matters very very quickly and it

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,339
was great and I can see that and now I'm

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,439
ready to do more right we spend a lot of

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,280
time worrying about mentoring and all

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,950
that sort of stuff but in truth I would

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,600
only give us an average ish grade on it

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,310
right because it's hard it's a lot

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,040
harder than we think it is in fact it

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,160
takes a lot of time to properly

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,320
introduce somebody into a community as

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,260
complicated as fedora or some of them

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,930
were the ones whatever you guys work in

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:53,130
so chris tyler this professor at seneca

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:57,870
college a few years ago started working

00:17:53,130 --> 00:18:01,200
with with mozilla and what he was trying

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,420
to do and this and this this idea that

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,550
he had that i'm about to explain it sort

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,860
of has sort of been the the germination

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,630
of what has turned into teaching open

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,400
source and that red hat has also been

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,440
trying to add its weight and investment

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,650
behind what he was trying to do was work

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,500
with the mozilla organization to take

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,170
his classroom of students and to

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,210
successfully put them into the mozilla

00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,880
community as part of their actual

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,950
classwork right in a semester how do you

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,070
take someone in a semester who maybe

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,260
does not have any previous experience

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,760
working with open source that never use

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,740
source control they've never

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,910
collaborated on a project with someone

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,920
else because they've been taught from

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,210
day one that if you work with the person

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,600
sitting next to you you're a dirty

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,419
cheater who deserves to be expelled how

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,860
do you take people who have never

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,320
worked on software in the way that we

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,330
work on it in the real world and put

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,980
them into a meaningful project so that

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,629
their end results aren't just some toy

00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,129
program that gets thrown away at the end

00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,899
of semester and never looked at again

00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:03,990
but they can actually point to something

00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:07,190
real that they have contributed that is

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,919
you know that is used and and and being

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,320
and had a purpose beyond just teaching

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:18,840
you how to you know do linked lists

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,549
right the system that they used did a

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,110
nice job of addressing this mentoring

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,179
problem right and I would encourage you

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,769
all to think about this in whatever your

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:30,149
own projects are there is nothing more

00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:34,230
demotivational i would say than to take

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:35,759
a newbie an enthusiastic newbie drop

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,139
them into something and then have them

00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,360
fail because you weren't able to

00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:41,610
properly support them right and chris

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,769
was afraid not because of any flaws in

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,389
mozilla because Fedora has all the same

00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,980
flaws and canonical does and when

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:49,440
everyone probably has all the same flaws

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,990
Chris was afraid that if you took these

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,700
newbies and you drop them in directly

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,950
into the project and asked them to sink

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,590
or swim on their own that they just

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,409
wouldn't be able to cope and they get

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:04,169
flamed away and you know the whole thing

00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:06,119
would fail so what they did was they set

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,639
up sort of a sandboxed environment right

00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,960
and they got IRC and they had mailing

00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:11,820
list and they did all the sorts of

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,190
communication and collaboration that we

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,990
do an open source but they sandbox the

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,879
students away a little bit and the

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:23,190
professors started out as kind of the

00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:24,659
integration point right the professor's

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,779
form the relationships with the people

00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:30,509
in the community and we're able to be

00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,580
that translation right and bring certain

00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:35,249
pieces of that community at the right

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,720
time to the students while not flooding

00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:39,899
the community with a bunch of newbies

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,730
and you know keeping everything more or

00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:44,429
less sort of working well together this

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,720
worked nicely and what it's led us to is

00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:51,929
a is a is a project that Red Hat

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,490
sponsors that we call a posse right we

00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,220
call it the professor's open-source

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,889
summer experience right and I came from

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,570
this idea chris tyler and his and his

00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,140
and his teaching partner guy named Dave

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,330
Humphrey

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,460
were successful because they understood

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,690
the Mozilla community right they were

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,580
able to find that subset of contributors

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,590
within Mozilla who believed in their

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,480
educational goals and they were able to

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,310
work with work with that subset of

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,470
contributors to create a good experience

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,850
for the students but there are a lot of

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:25,770
professors who are understanding the

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,080
power of open source who are

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,300
understanding that it is valuable to

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,800
them to bring their students to open

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:36,420
source but this mentoring problem is

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,940
where they get tripped up because the

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,650
professor's themselves don't necessarily

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,100
have the experience working in an open

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,870
source community right and how can you

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,370
teach someone else to do something if

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,950
you yourself don't have an idea

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,970
generally of how to do it to begin with

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:56,660
right so what the posse program is and

00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,330
it's into its third or fourth year now

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:04,440
is basically a boot camp that Red Hat

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:07,050
runs for professors who are interested

00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,490
in making open source a core part of the

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,530
computer science classes that they're

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,090
teaching professors who already have

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,460
those classes right they know they're

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,190
going to be teaching in September you

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,660
know a class about computer science and

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,580
they're ready to make open-source part

00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,910
of it we run these professors through a

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,390
week-long boot camp where we introduce

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:29,580
them to bug tracking we introduce them

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,410
to source control we teach them a bit

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,720
about packaging we make sure they

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,580
understand how to collaborate on IRC and

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,800
on mailing lists we put them through a

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,000
bit of an apprenticeship into open

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,310
source so that they can form some

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,290
relationships they can gain some context

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,870
and they can they can begin to figure

00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,010
out how to bring that in turn to their

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,800
students and here's one of the

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,360
remarkable things you talk about how age

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,430
doesn't matter in open source

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,240
communities and how credentials don't

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:04,140
even matter the posse workshops that we

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,180
have done in every case where we've had

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,720
the day where we teach the professors

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,430
about you know make files and getting

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,659
code out of get or subversion or

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:17,299
whatever the person who has taught that

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:22,940
has been a college student themselves

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:24,080
right who has learned all this stuff

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,059
through their interactions with the

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,129
Fedora project and you have an active

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:33,470
college student teaching University

00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:35,659
Professors how to compile code the

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,239
open-source way right and it's and it's

00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:41,929
tremendous right you should see you know

00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:44,149
I wish all of you could see it the

00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:47,779
professor's love it right they love

00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:51,320
seeing how much enthusiasm there is

00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:54,019
right because it inspires them to see

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,849
wow there are there are kids who are so

00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,440
far ahead and there are kids who have

00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:00,320
learned so much from the open source

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,119
world right and they and they sit there

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,309
and they think I can bring that to my

00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,479
classroom right and we can grow this and

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,950
we can make this happen and the

00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:09,019
professors are the key to all of it

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:14,330
because it's the only scalability point

00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:19,309
right the open-source way is so much

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:24,580
about leverage right and and and and a

00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:27,649
professor properly properly resourced

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,349
can bring the open-source way of doing

00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:32,359
things to students every semester until

00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:34,220
the end of time right and those

00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,049
professors can then bring it to each

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,289
other right one of the one of the

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,940
difficulties you know it's it's funny

00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:43,099
and you know in the in the software

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,259
industry you know more and more you say

00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:46,729
hey I work at Red Hat and people are

00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:47,749
willing to open the door for you and let

00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:49,789
you in and they want to hear what you

00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:52,220
have to say right red hats brand is very

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:54,379
powerful in the software industry in

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,779
academia we're still trying to gain

00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:58,159
credibility right I'm not saying red

00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:00,619
house brand is powerful to brag it's

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,830
just you know it were big company in the

00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:05,779
in in in Linux land in academia no one

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,389
you know three years ago no one knew who

00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,309
we are no one cared in the slightest

00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:11,599
right and a lot of what we are trying to

00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:15,379
do with the teaching open source

00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:18,799
community pardon me is bring those

00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:22,009
professors together show them that red

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:25,700
hat is trying to learn how to speak

00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:28,400
their language right and to try to gain

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,590
some credibility over time in academia

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,210
so that the open-source way of doing

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,610
things can continue to permeate computer

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:38,480
science departments and can continue to

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:40,420
sort of revolutionize the way the

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,770
computer science is taught when I was in

00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,330
column in this room did computer science

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:49,460
and ecology there is a major just a

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:51,800
couple classes a bunch of right so I

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,520
graduated from college about ten years

00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,940
ago you guys can tell me your own

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,520
experiences if you want in a little bit

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:04,450
open source was not taught in my

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,300
computer science classes we were left to

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:12,890
discover linux on our own we were left

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:15,590
to discover CVS on our own the

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,900
professor's all sort of assumed that we

00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,480
would and everyone kind of did

00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,510
eventually but it was seen as this

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,520
curiosity you know and this like

00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,140
additionally nerdy thing that you

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,820
already nerds are you know you're

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,410
already super nerdy to be doing computer

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,050
science and now you're taking like an

00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,420
elective nerdiness to learn about linux

00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,040
even outside that classroom I'd like to

00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,500
see that change right I want to see that

00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,690
you know that that's what that's what we

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,940
are hoping to sort of flip on its head

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,470
thank you and the teaching open source

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,180
community is kind of part of that I'm

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,770
starting to ramble and whenever I start

00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,940
to ramble I feel like I should stop and

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:58,360
ask for any sort of comments or

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:58,360
questions so far yes please yes

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:10,550
people who end up having to write goat

00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:13,760
they've never drank yeah yeah the

00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:15,290
question was the question was have we

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,470
started to think about things outside of

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,550
the scope just of computer science

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,740
you're not going to love the answer here

00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:26,590
Jeff but I'll give it to you anyway the

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,590
answer is we'd love to of course but

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:33,410
resource limitations force us to focus

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,960
on the thing that's closest to our core

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:39,160
competency at red hat which is computer

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,840
science what one thing we have seen is

00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,160
for instance you know taking advantage

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,380
of the fact that something like the

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,380
Fedora project is so much more than just

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,030
a bunch of code package onto a CD but we

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,960
do artwork we do marketing we do

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:56,630
documentation we have we've seen we've

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,130
seen for instance one of the professor's

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,320
a guy named Matt jaded who teaches at

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,230
Allegheny College which is a liberal

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,850
arts school in Pennsylvania we've seen

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,010
him take some students who were in a

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,480
marketing class like a digital you know

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:13,010
marketing in the digital world or

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:17,030
something like that kind of class and he

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:19,220
worked with us to change the homework

00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,800
assignments that those students did so

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,000
that what they were doing was

00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,910
participating in the Fedora marketing

00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,470
team live during a release cycle of

00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:32,600
Fedora right and trying to produce some

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,570
of the deliverables as their assignment

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,250
that fedoras marketing team would do was

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,900
it the most successful thing that has

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,890
ever happened and did it change the

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,150
Fedora marketing project forever no

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,650
there was a lot of learning in both

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,170
directions right which is what you would

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,450
expect the first time you try something

00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:53,210
but the fact that the fact that the

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:56,270
professor even wanted to give it a try

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,700
and that the community members were

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,740
willing to support that attempt to me

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,210
shows that a connection at least has

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,180
been made and that things continue to

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,790
grow now we would love to we would love

00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,470
to expand to as many things as possible

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,210
I just don't you know it's just a

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:15,010
question of scale and and and people

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,010
right that's that's that's what I see

00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:28,260
how many universities have we right so

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:30,300
so we've I think we're getting close to

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:37,200
about a hundred professors who have gone

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:40,050
through the boot camp yeah the hope was

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,240
right the hope you know the hope was

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,280
when we started this when we started

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,840
this idea and actually Jeff this brings

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,990
me to the next point I wanted to make

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,670
the hope was that professors would come

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,400
to this boot camp they do it for a week

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,680
and then the next summer you know half

00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,780
of those professors who are now alumni

00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,760
of this boot camp would organize and run

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,260
their own right because all the content

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,940
that went into it of course was openly

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,930
licensed and any what he could take it

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,870
and sort of carry it on that was an

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,860
aggressive that was an aggressive hope

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:14,010
part of the reason why that was

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,100
aggressive was because we as in Red Hat

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,840
underestimated the difference between

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,090
sort of the life cycle of things in

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,270
technology world and the life cycle of

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:28,110
things in academia right if I make a

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,960
plan for my team that goes a year ahead

00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,490
of time there are certain people who

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,970
will look at me like I'm crazy because

00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,260
you know how could you possibly know

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,940
what is going to be happening a year

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,580
from now don't even worry about it right

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,380
in academia we're learning if you make a

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,840
plan that doesn't look three to five

00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,390
years into the future you're a

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,460
dilettante who has no conception of

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,650
ability to sort of think and plan ahead

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,270
right so the the life cycles of these

00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,090
sorts of things a six-month release

00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:00,000
cycle for fedora I mean that's crazy

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,040
right you know in academia things are

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,810
much slower so to expect that that a

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,760
professor who does something one summer

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:11,370
is ready to you know replicate and grow

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,140
that one year later that next summer of

00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,510
theirs might have already been planned

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,820
and spoken for you know two years ago

00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:22,730
right so we've seen one good example

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,169
where

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,910
some professors of the Rochester

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:27,350
Institute of Technology and this is this

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:33,500
is this school is a really interesting

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:35,330
example because you know we like to

00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,669
think of universities as these sort of

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,780
you know altruistic places of education

00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,400
but they're in competition with each

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,620
other as well right and they're trying

00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,730
to differentiate each other and one of

00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,559
the things that the Rochester Institute

00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,110
of Technology is using as a

00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:50,330
differentiator is they're embracing of

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,400
open source right and they're trying to

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,780
really aggressively make open source a

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,330
part of their computer science

00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:59,720
department because they think that will

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,880
attract writer high school students who

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,320
are already beginning to be introduced

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,820
to that sort of stuff and want to go to

00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,520
school somewhere where they can do more

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,710
and more of it a couple of professors

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,960
that came to the the posse that we did

00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:17,240
at RIT last year are organizing another

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,760
one there this year and they've reached

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,380
out to their sort of local you know

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,200
other other professors and schools

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,679
nearby and that's been that's been the

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,720
example of of scale that we had sort of

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,940
imagined the thing that we have also

00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:37,640
done at Red Hat to try to modify our

00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:39,140
posse program is to change it from from

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,940
this right so here was the other problem

00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,230
that we notice we brought professors in

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,270
for a wig I'll get to your question in a

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,860
second you can put your hand down we

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,110
brought professors in for a week and

00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,860
then we loose them back upon their world

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,660
and we sort of hoped that they would use

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,280
the teaching open source community as

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,480
you know a magnet and they would all

00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,160
come back there and get on the mailing

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,080
list and talk to each other but it

00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,059
wasn't really the case right we found

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,590
that we had a great week with them and

00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:09,230
then a lot of them we sort of lost

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:12,320
contact with so one of the modifications

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:15,380
that Mel chua who leads Red Hat's

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,010
education initiatives these days has

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,410
made is and this you guys will find this

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,799
interesting I hope we've created some

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:28,429
modules right we've broken Posse down

00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:31,190
using the theory discussed in the open

00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:34,669
source way we've broken Posse down into

00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,700
a series of here look at this sort of

00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:39,040
stuff right release early release

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:44,260
often up streaming version control

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:47,890
trackers and tickets marketing remix

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:50,020
Singh licensing you know we've tried to

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,790
break down the things that we would

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,550
teach professors all in one big long

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,080
week in two different modules and we're

00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,420
going to now what we're doing this

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,250
summer is we're trying this out with 15

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,770
professor class we're going to bring

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,200
them all together for two days in July

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,820
to make sure they meet each other get

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,560
some personal relationships will go

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,650
through the first module with them and

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,900
then we're going to well use the

00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,240
collaboration power of the Internet to

00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:19,380
go through all of these other modules

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,940
and the rest of this Posse curriculum I

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,080
think it's like every every six weeks or

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,270
something like that we're going to bring

00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,500
them all together and do another one but

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,230
we're going to do we're going to do that

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,770
collaboration virtually voy video chat

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:35,110
IRC things like that and try to keep

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:38,230
that heartbeat going with some

00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:41,770
consistency over the course of a year so

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,510
that maybe we can kind of you know keep

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,080
their enthusiasm up keep their attention

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,210
up and force them to collaborate more

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,270
with each other which will eventually

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,860
turn into have it so that's another

00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,300
thing that's another thing that we're

00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,350
doing what's actionable out of all of

00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:02,470
this for you guys all most of you

00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,700
probably a lot of you raised your hand

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,590
when you said that you did computer

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,140
science sometime in your life right

00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:10,810
maybe you had a professor or two who you

00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:14,280
feel like you'd like to get back in

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,870
touch with and you know that they were

00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,730
you know already partial to open source

00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,770
or things like that and you like to

00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,080
introduce them to what's going on in

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,550
teaching open source and you know tell

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:30,040
them to take a look at it and maybe come

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:32,230
join this community this is this is a

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,930
unique community because it's not about

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,940
building a product in the end right the

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:43,090
end game of this is something that

00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:45,330
enhances the value of open source for

00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:48,280
everybody right this is about mine share

00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,320
this is about growing the mindshare that

00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,510
open source has in the next generation

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,460
of engineers in the next generation of

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:57,090
leaders in the next generation of people

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,680
who are going to be managing and running

00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,360
companies right and maybe we'll maybe

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,130
we're focused on technology companies

00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,780
right now but to your point Jeff we

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:23,020
won't always be right so yeah what was

00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:24,790
your question in the back right do you

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,780
know what that was called the press

00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,850
release I thought didn't get the name

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,690
for it right right um King you want to

00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:34,330
repeat what you said for the video i

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,790
read recently about a project from

00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,320
faucet rit that was to make a video chat

00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,940
program for deaf users to be able to

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,700
talk in sign language and i was

00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,140
wondering if you knew what the the name

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,750
of the end result was or where we could

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:52,830
find the code or anything like that

00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:52,830
let's find out i will google it

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:16,869
any other questions comments while we're

00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:18,280
figuring this out anyone who can get to

00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,760
Google on their own and find the answer

00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,400
to this question yes sir it's always

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,980
been my understanding that unix linux

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,390
started out an edu environment they came

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:34,150
out of the might ease it came out of the

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:36,670
UC berkeley's of the world so well

00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,220
understanding from you based on what

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,589
you've said so far is that over the

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,900
years since the origination the first

00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:45,220
linux kernels and all of that came out

00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,380
of you know because it all came out it

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,060
for example i need to build a piece of

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,130
software that will allow me to more

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,330
accurately predict weather patterns okay

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,010
so let's build this piece of software

00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,710
and share what i do other universes so

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,530
my question is has there been a big

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,500
disconnect in the engineer you can use

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:06,490
computer science over the past 15 20

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:09,730
years we're pretty much you know you got

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:11,440
students that come out of these programs

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,990
pretty much all i knew in the know is

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:20,230
net and that's it it's not what you're

00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:22,930
saying is for these weird did you know

00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,550
it seems like it's people who have

00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:28,930
comments on that so who wants to talk

00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:30,970
about that before before i do no no this

00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:35,369
is good the less i talk the better the

00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,369
talk goes yes sir

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:47,780
okay okay sixty percent of our students

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:51,230
coming in have to take remedial courses

00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,450
up front so we're already behind the

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:56,869
eight ball when it comes to math and

00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:59,960
English further as we go along through

00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:02,119
it the students are not motivated so how

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,150
can we expect them to do projects that

00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:07,369
we assign 15 and 20 years ago when all

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,440
they want to do is sit around and tap on

00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:13,030
their cell phones and talk on Facebook

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,319
and you know and play their video games

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:19,480
that's all they want to do they don't

00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:22,309
even want to make a video game okay so

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,040
how can we expect them to do open source

00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,839
projects and bigger type things when I

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,210
have a hell of a time getting a senior

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:35,900
to write 200 lines of Java code in a

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:41,809
week and and what's the answer you're

00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:44,119
looking for looking for it right hold on

00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:47,089
one at a time who's next who wants to

00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:52,819
say something they were like four people

00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:55,040
talking up here working at a local

00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:57,530
university and you know I keep hearing

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,920
that it's like that across the nation

00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:06,500
across the world so I don't have an

00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:09,589
answer I have one comment to add to that

00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,780
I'm a current student and a lot of the

00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:14,059
school work that I'm doing it's not any

00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,309
of this open source stuff it's it's busy

00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:17,660
work in that I'm doing work that's been

00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:19,970
done by the last class been done by the

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:22,849
last class and at the end of the class

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,890
there's no actual result that I can take

00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:27,740
and feel that I have contributed

00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,599
something that I've done anything and

00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,809
it's also a lot different than the

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,990
open-source started to do as a hobby I

00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:38,900
just see a big disconnect that I like

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:40,579
this type of program in that I can feel

00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,770
that I'm doing something useful with my

00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:44,770
end of course closure the thing that

00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:00,530
no it's a valid point I mean there's you

00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:02,300
know I think the you know I think what

00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:05,720
I'm hearing from you sir is that you

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,040
know part of the issue is that you've

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,470
got you know you've got such a large

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,540
continuum that students fall on as well

00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,670
right and and I'm sitting up here 20

00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,130
minutes ago talking about you know the

00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,630
kids that were the smartest kids in

00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,890
their high school class that already

00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,450
kind of knew everything that was trying

00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,869
to be taught to them and they found open

00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,700
source because the magic of the internet

00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:27,080
and open licensing allows that open

00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:40,100
source to be there for them and I think

00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:44,060
you're talking about yeah yeah okay yes

00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:47,540
sir I just graduated and my school

00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:49,220
teachers Python um and I don't know how

00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,300
much of how big deal is verse Java

00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,940
there's a spoiler play you could argue

00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,800
but the idea of having projects rather

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,780
than going 0 to 60 going from nothing to

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,980
open source like you know you're saying

00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,910
that's hard because you're not be able

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,700
to contribute not going to know what

00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,609
unit tests are you know before you know

00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,710
what a loop is but having some sort of

00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,840
building up to it you know it I think

00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,600
that is a strategy potentially I'm sure

00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,950
you've had experience with that but I

00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,750
would suggest something like projects as

00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:17,630
opposed to just dump you an open source

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,640
like like small products out of you know

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:22,220
like build a poker program or whatever

00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,480
so intermediate stuff before you jump

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,830
into advanced stuff and that's what

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,340
works that's the worst of my school to

00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,340
some extent

00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,730
I work in a community college and I have

00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,890
some of the same problems as the

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,170
gentleman in the back do but I also

00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,859
recently took a master's program and

00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,630
interactive technology that was

00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,190
horrifyingly easy I mean I could have

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,710
done it in high school it was really

00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,240
really bad and and the people that I was

00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,890
in this master's program with were

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,200
struggling so we were talking yesterday

00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,940
about how degrees have become union

00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,700
cards and if everyone deserves a union

00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,900
card the issue is the education has to

00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,790
become more like an open source

00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,099
community where it's not about how old

00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,839
you are or what degree you have but if

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:10,180
you really have the chops to back up the

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,599
degree that you say you have and that's

00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:17,579
that's where education is is not doing a

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,579
service to the community in general

00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:36,099
what's the mic next no I mean I well you

00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:38,619
make it and then smooch can have it out

00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:41,589
just because I like you Jeff yeah that's

00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:45,760
unfortunate for you so one of the things

00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:48,910
that uh we're good at the door is we we

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,150
let things fail right we let people try

00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:55,150
they do they do an adequately bad job of

00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:59,349
it and then it's a failure and they get

00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:00,609
told that in academics who has who has

00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:02,319
the stone to tell someone in that

00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:03,880
they've really failed that they've

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,200
really messed up and they missed the

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:12,970
point and not know I mean but across the

00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:15,460
board I mean across the board how many

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,560
people just get degrees because they've

00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,630
paid their money they've paid their

00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,160
money and they've done their time and

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,560
they're going to get out because the

00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:27,040
university can't have fifty percent

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,599
channel your rate because it's a

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,849
prestige thing whereas r as an open

00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,220
community where the open source you know

00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:38,800
the prestigious than the numbers it's in

00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:41,410
it's in the output and well it's it's a

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,420
problem and in academics there's

00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,400
certainly there isn't necessarily the

00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:49,150
willingness to

00:44:45,400 --> 00:45:03,010
the blunt and to publicly shame which

00:44:49,150 --> 00:45:05,680
we're good at in other contexts so to

00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:07,990
answer the question earlier video chat

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,690
program to facilitate global deaf

00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:15,610
communication will premiere at jun 21st

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:23,250
through Trent Thun Thun yes tuned June

00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:27,940
June to W at an NTID sponsored symposium

00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:31,900
it is called opean we ate to take eat

00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:35,530
these language open video chat is

00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:39,970
designed Fallen One Laptop Per child

00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:42,640
computers it should be ready it and if

00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:48,700
you look for it there is a link it is a

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:56,190
add-on for 305 off of sugar activities

00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:56,190
sugar lab org add-on for 305 thank you

00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:06,330
I've been listening to your about open

00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:10,180
source and change but industry and

00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:15,370
technology is not really wanting change

00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:19,810
I worked at a plastics plant for 30

00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:23,410
years and it was very hard to come up

00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:27,570
with changes because basically equipment

00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:27,570
costs money so

00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:35,630
I can see the point where people want to

00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:39,169
stay the same you know the guy doesn't

00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,999
want to have the humans behavior doesn't

00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:45,049
want to have the change that the printer

00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:47,209
queue every you know how how how a

00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:50,899
normal user has been a sign on to the

00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:55,159
printer every time so and we've seen

00:46:50,899 --> 00:47:01,729
this with when they did away with VMs as

00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:03,289
far as control systems the plan I was

00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:05,089
working at was a window that went to a

00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:10,939
windows-based thing in every three years

00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:14,269
they changed windows and the IT boys and

00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:15,709
the process control people went to jump

00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:18,319
through hoops trying to get things to

00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:25,389
work three years ago worked and now

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:25,389
three years done so that causes a lot of

00:47:26,229 --> 00:47:34,489
pushback to not bring in new stuff even

00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:37,939
if the new stuff is better well I mean

00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:41,779
will actually run better but how how do

00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:45,559
you address that in your yeah well you

00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:49,429
know he's talking about sorry about the

00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:51,349
resistance to change that exists you

00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:54,469
know even in the IT industry for

00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:57,619
instance and and and what comes to my

00:47:54,469 --> 00:48:01,309
mind as as you say that is that is not

00:47:57,619 --> 00:48:03,529
that that that doesn't have to be anti

00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:06,409
open source right and I look for

00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:08,719
instance at well I'll use it because

00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:09,919
they write my check every two weeks but

00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,909
I look at me now look at Red Hat's

00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:15,919
business model right where we've got you

00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:17,839
know the reason why red had had to

00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:19,159
evolve over so many years was at the

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,289
beginning right it was just red hat

00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:23,749
linux right and everybody had the same

00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:25,369
red hat linux and red hat was a hat and

00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:28,939
t-shirt company that produced software's

00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:31,609
side effect and the problem with red hat

00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:33,289
linux for all its goodness was trying to

00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,959
serve two masters at the same time right

00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:37,699
the people who are the innovative you

00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:39,940
know engineers who want to break things

00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:41,620
and who want to innovate by breaking

00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,270
and then you know the folks who are

00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,490
actually trying to deploy something with

00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:48,060
stability and consistency that doesn't

00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:51,430
change you know for five to seven years

00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:54,430
and one piece of software open source or

00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,200
closed source couldn't make both those

00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,390
constituencies happy at the same time

00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,030
right so you can now have you know

00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:05,110
multiple vendors offering an enterprise

00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:07,480
linux product for the folks that don't

00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,400
want change and you've got again

00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,780
multiple vendors offering you know that

00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,820
innovative fast-paced you know we we use

00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,910
fedora but you know substitute that for

00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,980
whatever you like for the makers right

00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:24,040
and the and and and there have been

00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:27,250
natural there's natural synergies

00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:30,100
between those two things right you know

00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,710
we've got examples examples from the

00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,540
history of Red Hat of engineers that

00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:38,500
work for some of our biggest company our

00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:40,840
customers participating in the Fedora

00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,850
community and helping to build that next

00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,590
red hat enterprise linux that they will

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,230
buy right one of the great powers of

00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,760
open source is that our customers can

00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,980
help us build the product that we will

00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,710
sell them that's that's a good deal of

00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:57,360
your product manager right so that to me

00:49:53,710 --> 00:50:01,210
is how I address your point which is

00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,760
open source doesn't have to equal a

00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:08,350
rapid change open source just allows us

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,630
to take rapid change and stabilize it in

00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,550
a more efficient way I hope that maybe

00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,840
answered your question a little bit you

00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,670
had a comment back there you're going to

00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:24,420
probably fail me right now or something

00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:26,770
right what one of the problems that

00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,230
we're talking about how do you get

00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:34,810
students interested in this wonderful

00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:39,250
technology back in 1992 we you know 93

00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:43,020
we set up a Linux system 0.99 patch

00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:46,000
level 10 the great MCC distribution

00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,620
granted server for the college they

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,720
didn't know what all the president

00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,740
didn't know what four years

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,990
but so I set up this wonderful thing I

00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,940
menu the library's at first they're

00:50:54,990 --> 00:51:00,930
getting library loans I'm getting

00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:03,540
complaints after about a month I come in

00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:06,990
one Monday morning and there's no server

00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:10,050
space my figure I've screwed up or

00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:12,330
something so I start looking around and

00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:14,849
what I discovered in the server logs is

00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:20,070
if the students had discovered foo net

00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:22,320
dot AFI you've been there and you've

00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:24,300
been there okay you've been there you

00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,280
understand it was these should we say

00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:31,890
first adult repository after that

00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:36,030
library usage versus that you seizures

00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:39,270
this massive imbalance okay if you check

00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:42,599
the Student server logs what's coming

00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:45,330
out of the dorm traffic there's another

00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,680
issue there and it's one that von Braun

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,720
and man you're going to have to make

00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,550
this interesting now some students will

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,270
be interested you still get traffic

00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:56,520
going over you know to the git

00:51:53,270 --> 00:52:02,250
repository but a lot of traffic goes

00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:05,730
various places ESPN playboy some were

00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:07,230
not gonna mention so part of what you're

00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:09,270
saying is how to get these students

00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:12,150
interested the answer is twenty years

00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:14,250
ago it was the same problem but some of

00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:17,400
them did become interested when they

00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:20,940
found out what they wanted to do some

00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:23,910
students you gave them after two years

00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,070
later they figure out why I mean it

00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:29,930
takes about that long for some up now

00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:33,150
beers gotta wear off and everything so

00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:35,580
patients I mean and that makes me think

00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,140
about sort of you know I won't say it

00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,570
was the thesis statement of this talk

00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:42,960
but one of the sort of core things that

00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:45,119
I care about which is how do we use open

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,210
source and how do we build communities

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,880
of professors and their students who

00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:54,660
care about open source to give those

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:57,240
students a more authentic and a more

00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,640
useful experience in getting their

00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,060
degree so they walk out of that college

00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,830
and they can walk into

00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:07,260
any of the open-source companies with a

00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:10,680
booth at this conference and already

00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:13,110
know how to be productive engineers in

00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,670
that code base right and not have to

00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:17,520
learn that over the course of the first

00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:20,070
three years of their career but they can

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,350
they can start it right I these these

00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:25,020
interns that work you know on my team

00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:28,020
who have been participating in fedora

00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,600
since they were 15 I would hire them

00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,890
today right but this isn't the NFL where

00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,810
you tell a kid to drop out of college

00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,780
early for you know a billion-dollar

00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:39,060
contract right but I would hire them

00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,550
today if I could because they're already

00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:44,540
capable of doing everything that we

00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:47,670
would ask a junior level engineer to do

00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:52,140
so how do we make sure the rest of their

00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:54,090
college experience isn't just treading

00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,670
water right and making sure that they

00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:58,110
can continue to get even more and more

00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,240
out of what they're going to do as they

00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:02,190
get their degree and make sure that the

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,440
process of getting a degree in computer

00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,940
science and the process of becoming a

00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,310
productive member of an open source

00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,330
community kind of gets into lockstep I

00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,490
guess that's the best way I can

00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,830
summarize what I'm trying to talk about

00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:17,060
and what I care about the teaching open

00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:22,230
source community is early like I said

00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:25,560
academia is life span is long but this

00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:27,750
is where we're hanging out trying to get

00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:31,080
things done and everyone's invited of

00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:33,690
course so I guess we're kind of closed

00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,160
out of time I'm sort of done if there's

00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:38,010
more comments or questions we'll keep

00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,700
doing what we've been doing but I thank

00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,700
you all for your attention

00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:50,040
if anyone wants a fedora CD come and

00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:57,350
take one anybody else want to say

00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:57,350
anything okay thank you

00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,390
what about this I can help you like it

00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:13,510
we have the same problem applicable to

00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,510
do

00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:21,090
let's put the word out

00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,090
you

00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:35,680
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,270
all we do is hosted computing to us the

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,220
cloud is just the next generation of

00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,170
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,180
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,290
we're in a unique position to really

00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,420
help bring these two worlds together

00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:48,760
these different sets of technologies and

00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,070
to help companies embrace this new world

00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,080
in this great new tool that allows

00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,690
faster innovation not only is it about

00:56:53,080 --> 00:57:01,260
us being responsive and accountable but

00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:03,900
it's about us doing more for you webos

00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:07,450
nos that works the way that you do

00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:11,250
