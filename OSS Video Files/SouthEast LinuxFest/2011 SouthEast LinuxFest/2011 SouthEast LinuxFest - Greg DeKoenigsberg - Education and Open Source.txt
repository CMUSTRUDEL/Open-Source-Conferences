the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,870
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370

linux fest org the southeast linux fest

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,349
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,790
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:37,020
access to read text and give text

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,140
readings to kids who are in all

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,930
likelihood bored to tears with all of

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,930
the text that we see in front of us

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,140
another thing that disc me does we put

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,660
on an event called big ideas fest and

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,030
the idea of big ideas fest is to get

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,800
lots of teachers together smart people

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,170
who deal with the problems of education

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,600
everyday put them up in a really swank

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,820
hotel in Half Moon Bay California for a

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,010
few days ritz-carlton Golf Course very

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,250
nice you know get them a little liquored

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,630
up get them in big groups and say what

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,850
are the biggest problems that you face

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,590
and what sort of creative solutions can

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,360
you think of that that might help you

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,400
solve some of these problems leaving the

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,970
whole open education resource question

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,729
aside and the thing that they come back

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,490
to again and again and again is that the

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,530
kids are bored right and the reason the

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,189
kids are bored is they sit in a

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,750
classroom that looks the same way

00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,600
basically with a few bells and whistles

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,320
that a classroom looked like in 1875

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,850
wright with a with maybe a shiny white

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,439
board at the front where if you write

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,710
things on the whiteboard it'll put it on

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,630
a computer uh but they're still sitting

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,159
there and you know it's that maybe

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,740
they've got a textbook maybe they don't

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,930
all right my nephew doesn't have any

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,540
textbooks because his school system

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,890
can't currently afford them so you know

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,390
but art does that mean that they're

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,860
getting computers and all these classes

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,799
now it just means he gets more handouts

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,810
you know and and and there's like

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,369
digital versions of stuff he can look at

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,300
at home but doesn't have to and he

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,300
doesn't because he doesn't care

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:21,880
so is I mean is it so how do you get

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,880
through that right and that's sort of a

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,790
sort of a problem that when you're when

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,560
you when you when you look at this all

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:36,770
day every day you just think there has

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:40,610
to be more than this right so I read two

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,070
books in the past couple of years that

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:47,240
both got me thinking a lot about all of

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,880
this and they also relate to a couple of

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,050
stories that I'll tell one of those

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,760
books is a book called reality is broken

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,430
and it's written by a lady whose name

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,620
escapes me at the moment but google it

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,680
reality is broken and you'll find lots

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:08,110
of people raving about her book because

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,480
it basically talks about the fact that

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:16,550
there are more hours being spent right

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:20,269
now on video game play then we're spent

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,519
like in the entire productive history of

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:25,010
mankind until like the 1800s or

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,530
something right I mean a truly

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,239
astonishing amount of people's brain

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:34,430
time is going into online games right

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:42,920
and the whole book basically talks about

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:46,310
why that is right and and the the the

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,090
conclusions are basically that games are

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,220
really really brilliantly built

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:56,030
incentive engines right the whole point

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,810
of a well-built video game is to provide

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,850
incentives to play more video game to

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,890
spend more time playing video game to

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:08,239
spend more money on the next video game

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:10,250
alright to spend more money on the gold

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,709
that you need to buy the item that lets

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,560
you get to the next level in the video

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:19,880
game right it's a it's a brilliant sort

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:23,090
of engine for leveling up and giving

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,660
people a sense of satisfaction right fo

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,660
chief mint

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:35,950
any farmville players in here it's a

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,340
little bit it's a little bit of an

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,870
in-joke i am the lord of the plow my

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,960
title in the Fedora project is loaded

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,790
the plow the reason why I just so as

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,810
it's just I that the rest this can wait

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,250
so here's a funny story my wife plays a

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,170
lot of farm bill and I mean a lot of

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,940
farmville all right and she got tired of

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,160
her own farm so she basically

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,960
commandeered my farm because like you

00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,310
everything's dying you're never taking

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,510
care of your farm I'm like me you Logan

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,260
take care of my farm she said that's

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,120
exactly what I'm gonna do so she she's

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,170
over this mostly now by the way which is

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,610
good because she was spending a

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,400
ridiculous amount of money on little

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:19,690
sheep and those sheep with shamrocks and

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:23,440
sorry honey yeah so we were at a meeting

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,180
at Red Hat and all of the various

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,030
community folks were gathered around we

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,830
were having a fedora activity day and I

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,320
had legitimately important things that I

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,090
was working on so I basically came into

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,980
a meeting said hi to everybody and then

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,280
said that I had some very important work

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:43,480
to do and left and so then a friend

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,880
checked on facebook and saw that I had

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,700
just been awarded the lord of the plow

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,940
in farmville right so without

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,800
understanding what had gone on naturally

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,030
one assumes that I had big time to all

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,700
my friends that I could go play

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,700
farmville which was not in fact the case

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:08,140
yeah so so I'm the lord of the plough

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,530
right so haha funny the point of that is

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,570
that people spend a lot of time playing

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,620
video games right because video games

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:19,840
are more fun and yet somehow we have not

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,600
managed to harness that into anything

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:28,780
for education in any sort of real way

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:33,000
right interesting point number two that

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,710
that pertains to that I worked for a

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
what when I worked for red hat one of

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,350
the one of the things i did there for a

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,540
couple of years was I was Red Hat's

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:45,010
community liaison to the One Laptop Per

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,220
child project and in fact the first time

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,390
I came down here to spartanburg

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,510
greenville to talk about anything

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,000
open-source related was I guess about

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,160
four years ago maybe longer now 45 years

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,380
ago where I was coming down to to

00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,820
basically show the olpc and talk to a

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,230
bunch of people and that's how I met the

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,150
most the folks down here in fact and why

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,980
I keep coming back over here and so when

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,210
I was working with with the folks at one

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,280
laptop per child I got to spend a lot of

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,890
time up at MIT and I got to spend a lot

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,690
of time with the folks who were writing

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,800
the software putting together the

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,690
hardware repairing the broken hardware

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,940
and one of the things that continually

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:32,500
happened with the hardware was that the

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:36,820
j k l m keys would be completely worn

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,620
all the way down to the metal because 13

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:45,720
year old nigerian kids had found doom

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:48,310
right right so you build this awesome

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,810
educational device you know the same

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,640
thing once happened with the television

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,180
the television would be great it will

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,980
bring education to the masses you know

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,230
the olpc will be great it will bring

00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,630
education to the masses well you know

00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,890
you can try to give the masses something

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:09,630
educational but it doesn't mean that's

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:11,620
what they're going to sit for right so

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,470
and then I mentioned the other book that

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:18,070
I that I read and that book was a book

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:21,070
by a fellow called Michael horn and it's

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,450
a book called disrupting class look it

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,860
up it was co-written by Clayton

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,080
Christensen who wrote the innovators

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,900
dilemma and Michael horn looks at the

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,310
state of education today I wiggled maybe

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,310
I should just put the nyan cats back on

00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:43,240
as it cycles through no I care yet there

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,470
we go all right a little matter for

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,140
another 10 minutes anyway um yeah

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,520
Michael horn and Clayton Christensen so

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,000
Clayton Christians wrote the innovators

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:59,320
dilemma anyone familiar so those of you

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,580
who know the innovators dilemma the idea

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,610
behind the innovators dilemma is that

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:08,770
any entrenched system or company

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:10,780
business that tries to innovate knows

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,430
that it can't really innovate very much

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,440
because it's already beholden to the

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,410
customers and the systems that it

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,390
already serves right and the nature of

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,660
that arrangement means that almost all

00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:27,550
innovation comes from the outside right

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:30,550
and the innovators dilemma is that a you

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,830
know big wannabe innovator sees the

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,430
little guy coming season coming right

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,200
nothing they can do you know I already

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,080
have all of these government customers

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,850
that are using Solaris and it's mostly

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,440
good enough for them and if we just make

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,640
these few tweaks they say they'll buy

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,050
some more of it so that's what we're

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,080
going to do and this Linux thing it's a

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,830
fad right and then boom roasted all

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,600
right son go away innovators dilemma

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,820
education is in largely the same place

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,470
except it's it's an innovators dilemma

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,300
it's got all kinds of incumbency

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,830
problems because you got all that you

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,810
know you've got it's it's all the way

00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,480
from school boards at the local level to

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,680
the way schools are built all the way up

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,360
to the federal government where they're

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,060
continuing fights you know about the

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,560
Department of Education and despite all

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,050
of these fights and all this stuff

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,580
innovation in schools moves at a glacial

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,380
pace glacial pace right one of the

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,480
things about the One Laptop Per child

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,800
project one of the sort of underpinnings

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,690
that sort of predicates the whole idea

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,670
it was it was a great line I think maybe

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,920
it was Seymour Papert who's like the

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,660
constructionist guru maybe it was

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,880
Negroponte himself anyway the question

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:44,020
was how much would you have learned in

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,150
school if you had had a pencil for two

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,950
days a week and you went to pencil lab

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,730
to use it

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:53,080
alright what do you do an intensive lab

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,350
today I think we're going to learn how

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,770
to draw circles with the pencil in

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,240
pencil lab right and that's how that's

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,110
how that's how computers are in

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,290
classrooms and so the idea behind olpc

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,570
was a one-to-one computing right and

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,670
slowly we're finally getting to the to

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,900
the to the idea that you know there's

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,210
some there are some states that are

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,830
actually doing one-to-one computing but

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,940
it's a tool that everyone should have

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:24,970
right and computers are cheaper than

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,800
text books if you are spending X amount

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,740
on textbooks hundreds of dollars on

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,210
textbooks you get to the point where the

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:36,670
computer is cheaper so those were the

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:38,080
ideas behind one laptop per child and so

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,230
hold on I was going I was going

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,420
somewhere with that give me a minute I

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,790
was talking about Michael horn

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,380
innovators dilemma I think I was just

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,530
talking about the general slowly

00:11:47,380 --> 00:12:01,840
slowness of innovation to take to take

00:11:50,530 --> 00:12:03,460
shape in education so the good thing is

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,810
that there there there are people who

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,620
are starting to understand this and

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,190
there are things that are happening

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:13,840
happening slowly the Obama

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:17,230
administration understands sort of the

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,880
the power of open right and so they're

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,920
spending a lot of they recently put down

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,370
a two billion dollar grant for the

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:28,030
department of labor to produce access to

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:33,070
read text and give text readings to kids

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:36,220
who are in all likelihood bored to tears

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:41,200
with all of the text that we see in

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,820
front of us another thing that disc me

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,610
does we put on an event called Big Ideas

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,950
fest and the idea of big ideas fest is

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,480
to get lots of teachers together smart

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,760
people who deal with the problems of

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,620
Education everyday put them up in a

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,960
really swank hotel and a Half Moon Bay

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,750
California for a few days ritz-carlton

00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,310
Golf Course very nice you know get them

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,900
a little liquored up get

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,790
big groups and say what are the biggest

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,980
problems that you face and what sort of

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,600
creative solutions can you think of that

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,220
that might help you solve some of these

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,120
problems leaving the whole open

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,710
education resource question aside and

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,350
the thing that they come back to again

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,170
and again and again is that the kids are

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,290
bored right and the reason the kids are

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,140
bored is they sit in a classroom that

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,940
looks the same way basically with a few

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,740
bells and whistles that a classroom

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,390
looked like in 1875 wright with a with

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,650
maybe a shiny white board at the front

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,250
where if you write things on the

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,600
whiteboard it'll put it on a computer uh

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,220
but they're still sitting there and you

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,140
know it's that maybe they've got a

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,420
textbook maybe they don't all right my

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,370
nephew doesn't have any textbooks

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,160
because his school system can't

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,240
currently afford them so you know but

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,860
art does that mean that they're getting

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,990
computers and all these classes now it

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,630
just means he gets more handouts you

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,279
know and and and there's like digital

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,750
versions of stuff he can look at at home

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:10,040
but doesn't have to and he doesn't

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:12,710
because he doesn't care so is I mean is

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,900
it so how do you get through that right

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:21,440
and that says sort of a sort of a

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,540
problem that when you're when you when

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,190
you when you look at this all day every

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:31,490
day you just think there has to be more

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:35,270
than this right so I read two books in

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:39,400
the past couple of years that both got

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:41,690
me thinking a lot about all of this and

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,570
they also relate to a couple of stories

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:48,440
that I'll tell one of those books is a

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:50,810
book called reality is broken and it's

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,270
written by a lady whose name escapes me

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,310
at the moment but google it reality is

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,040
broken and you'll find lots of people

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:02,350
raving about her book because it

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,720
basically talks about the fact that

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:10,790
there are more hours being spent right

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:13,850
now on video game play then we're spent

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:16,670
like in the entire productive

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,250
history of mankind until like the 1800s

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,769
or something right I mean a truly

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,480
astonishing amount of people's brain

00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:28,670
time is going into online games right

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:37,160
and the whole book basically talks about

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:40,550
why that is right and and the the the

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,329
conclusions are basically that games are

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:46,459
really really brilliantly built

00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:50,240
incentive engines right the whole point

00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:54,050
of a well-built video game is to provide

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,089
incentives to play more video game to

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,130
spend more time playing video game to

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:02,480
spend more money on the next video game

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:04,490
alright to spend more money on the gold

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,949
that you need to buy the item that lets

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,800
you get to the next level in the video

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:14,120
game right it's a it's a brilliant sort

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:17,329
of engine for leveling up and giving

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:22,279
people a sense of satisfaction right fo

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:24,490
chief meant any farmville players in

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,490
here

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,560
it's a little bit it's a little bit of

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,090
an in-joke i am the lord of the plow my

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,210
title in the Fedora project is loaded

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,280
the plow the reason why I just so as

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:44,180
it's just I that the rest is can wait so

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,500
here's a funny story my wife plays a lot

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,420
of farm bill and I mean a lot of

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,120
farmville all right and she got tired of

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,070
her own farm so she basically commandeer

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,480
to my farm because like you everything's

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,950
dying you're never taking care of your

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,450
farm I'm like we you Logan take care of

00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,380
my farm she said that's exactly what I'm

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,940
gonna do so she she's over this mostly

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,260
now by the way which is good because she

00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,660
was spending a ridiculous amount of

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:13,160
money on little sheep than those sheep

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:16,670
with shamrocks and sorry honey yeah so

00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,530
we were at a meeting at Red Hat and all

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,090
of the various community folks were

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,090
gathered around we were having a fedora

00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,830
activity day and I had legitimately

00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,110
important things that I was working on

00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:29,090
so I basically came into a meeting said

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,250
hi to everybody and then said that I had

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:35,060
some very important work to do and left

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:38,900
and so then a friend checked on facebook

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:42,050
and saw that I had just been awarded the

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,190
lord of the plow in farmville right so

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,570
without understanding what had gone on

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,070
naturally one assumes that I had big

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,740
time doll my friends that I could go

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:58,040
play farmville which was not in fact the

00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:02,180
case yeah so so I'm the lord of the

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,390
plough right so haha funny the point of

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,430
that is that people spend a lot of time

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:11,270
playing video games right because video

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:13,640
games are more fun and yet somehow we

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,310
have not managed to harness that into

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:22,670
anything for education in any sort of

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:25,250
real way right interesting point number

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,220
two that that pertains to that I worked

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,960
for a

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,250
what when I worked for red hat one of

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,600
the one of the things i did there for a

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,790
couple of years was I was Red Hat's

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,260
community liaison to the One Laptop Per

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:41,440
child project and in fact the first time

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,640
I came down here to spartanburg

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,700
greenville to talk about anything

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,250
open-source related was I guess about

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,380
four years ago maybe longer now 45 years

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,630
ago where I was coming down to to

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,070
basically show the olpc and talk to a

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,480
bunch of people and that's how I met the

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,400
most the folks down here in fact and why

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,230
I keep coming back over here and so when

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,429
I was working with with the folks at one

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,559
laptop per child I got to spend a lot of

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:12,140
time up at MIT and I got to spend a lot

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,940
of time with the folks who were writing

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,020
the software putting together the

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,940
hardware repairing the broken hardware

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,190
and one of the things that continually

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,750
happened with the hardware was that the

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:31,070
j k l m keys would be completely worn

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,870
all the way down to the metal because 13

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:39,940
year old nigerian kids had found doom

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:42,530
right right so you build this awesome

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,059
educational device you know the same

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,860
thing once happened with the television

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,429
the television would be great it will

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,230
bring education to the masses you know

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:53,480
the olpc will be great will bring

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,880
education to the mass as well you know

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,200
you can try to give the masses something

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:03,850
educational but it doesn't mean that's

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:05,870
what they're going to sit for right so

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,690
and then I mentioned the other book that

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:12,290
I that I read and that book was a book

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,320
by a fellow called Michael horn and it's

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,700
a book called disrupting class look it

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,080
up it was co-written by Clayton

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,330
Christensen who wrote the innovators

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,210
dilemma and Michael horn looks at the

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:26,559
state of education today wiggled maybe I

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,559
should just put the nyan cats back on

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:37,400
as it cycles through I know I care yet

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:42,110
there we go all right won't matter for

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,600
another 10 minutes anyway yeah Michael

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,070
horn and Clayton Christensen so Clayton

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,550
Christians read the interview dilemma

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:53,690
anyone familiar so those of you who know

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:55,160
the innovators dilemma the idea behind

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,320
the innovators dilemma is that any

00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:03,440
entrenched system or company business

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,240
that tries to innovate knows that it

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,250
can't really innovate very much because

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,260
it's already beholden to the customers

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,500
and the systems that it already serves

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,600
right and the nature of that arrangement

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,650
means that almost all innovation comes

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,920
from the outside right and the

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:25,010
innovators dilemma is that a you know

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,050
big wannabe innovator sees the little

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,830
guy coming sees them coming right

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,450
nothing they can do you know I already

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,480
have all of these government customers

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,100
that are using Solaris and it's mostly

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,690
good enough for them and if we just make

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,890
these few tweaks they say they'll buy

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,300
some more of it so that's what we're

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,330
going to do in this Linux thing it's a

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,080
fad right and then boom roasted all

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,880
right son go away innovators dilemma

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,070
education is in largely the same place

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,690
except it's it's an innovators dilemma

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,520
it's got all kinds of incumbency

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,080
problems because you got all that you

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,910
know you've got it's it's all the way

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,730
from school boards at the local level to

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,930
the way schools are built all the way up

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,610
to the federal government where they're

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,310
continuing fights you know about the

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,740
Department of Education and despite all

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,300
of these fights and all this stuff

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:15,830
innovation in schools moves at a glacial

00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,630
pace glacial pace right one of the

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,700
things about the One Laptop Per child

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,990
project one of the sort of underpinnings

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,940
that sort of predicates the whole idea

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,920
it was it was a great line I think maybe

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,140
it was Seymour Papert who's like the

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,880
constructionist guru maybe it was

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,070
Negroponte himself anyway the question

00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,270
was how much would you have learned in

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:40,370
school if you had had a pencil for two

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,260
days a week and you went to pencil lab

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,800
to use it

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,090
all right what are you doing in pencil

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,600
lab today I think we're going to learn

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:53,990
how to draw circles with the pencil in

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,460
pencil lab right and that's how that's

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,360
how that's how computers are in

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,540
classrooms and so the idea behind olpc

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,820
was a one-to-one computing right and

00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,890
slowly we're finally getting to the to

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,150
the to the idea that you know there's

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,400
some there are some states that are

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,080
actually doing one-to-one computing but

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,160
it's a tool that everyone should have

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,190
right and computers are cheaper than

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,050
text books if you are spending X amount

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,990
on textbooks hundreds of dollars on

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,460
textbooks you get to the point where the

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:30,920
computer is cheaper so those were the

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,330
ideas behind one laptop per child and so

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,480
hold on I was going I was going

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,640
somewhere with that give me a minute I

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,040
was talking about Michael horn

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
innovators dilemma I think I was just

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,750
talking about the general slowly

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:56,090
slowness of innovation to take to take

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:57,710
shape in education so the good thing is

00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,060
that there there there are people who

00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,840
are starting to understand this and

00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,440
there are things that are happening

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:08,090
happening slowly the Obama

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:11,450
administration understands sort of the

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,100
the power of open right and so they're

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,170
spending a lot of they recently put down

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,080
a two billion dollar grant for the

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,970
department of labor to produce

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,120
educational materials for trade schools

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,780
right and that two billion dollars all

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,890
has to be spent any anything that comes

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,120
out of that two billion dollar

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:33,980
investment must be licensed cc-by and

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,660
made available right so government money

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,820
is starting to go into open resources

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:44,870
but none of that solves the problem of

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:49,160
you know kids being bored right so I you

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:52,640
know I figure I've got lots of time on

00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,650
my hands yes you have a question about

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,740
kids being

00:24:53,650 --> 00:25:00,180
word how do you solve it do you turn on

00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:04,360
a little bit of games if so how much

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:07,600
well so this is the interesting thing if

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,310
you tried and oh you know what thank you

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,010
because now I remember where I was going

00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,770
you don't solve the problem for the kid

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,560
in the American classroom right because

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,180
innovation happens at the edges

00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,970
innovation naturally happens in

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,310
underserved communities right those

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,640
innovations happen for people who can't

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:30,130
afford the big shiny thing and so the

00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,040
cost of whatever the replacement

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,810
technology is tends to go down and be

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,940
more targeted to the people that it's

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,890
serving may not as be good as all the

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,320
stuff in the middle but it's good enough

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,830
that it's useful for these folks out

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,290
here and if you construct it right they

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,970
can sort of take that stuff and improve

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,920
it and make it better and the people

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,440
serving that market grow because the

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,780
market grows with it and then suddenly

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,240
you get to a tipping point where the

00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:01,510
stuff on the edges is just as good

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,290
better in some cases but certainly good

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,970
enough from a sort of cost perspective

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,260
to say well hey we can just use all this

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,820
stuff and why are we paying all this

00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,470
money for these things again why are we

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,390
paying all these money for you kno

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:21,360
textbooks and you know so so how much

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:25,630
game is too much how much is not enough

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,820
well the answer is that right now those

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,010
educational games for the underserved

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,250
communities around the world don't exist

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,850
at all don't exist at all very little of

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:41,980
the content that they actually need

00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:44,080
exists in any format right and so the

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,810
question that had welts oh so what would

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,600
it take to produce that right how much

00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:53,110
work does it take to produce something

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:57,790
that kids around the world can use that

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:59,980
is vaguely educational that is open that

00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:04,690
is in a format that everyone can get to

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:06,909
uh how much would that take right how

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,080
many people would it take to do that

00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:13,179
take and how long right would it take

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,570
dozen years hundred years you know tens

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:26,220
of thousands of man-hours what's so

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:26,220
funny thing this dude

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,739
where's your MP max

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:57,370
waiting yeah it's still online waiting

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,870
transferring waiting so here's one of

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,750
those innovators I'm talking about his

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:05,260
name is Sal Khan how many people know of

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:08,740
Sal Khan right he's sort of famous now

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:11,170
and the reason he's famous is because he

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,920
decided that he could take on at least

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:20,230
part of this problem by himself right

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:23,200
one dude so what Sal Khan did was he

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,890
looked at all of the things that he

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,460
thought that he needed to teach from a

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:35,620
math perspective to his kid and kids

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:38,010
like his kid and he did these videos one

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,010
at a time

00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:57,740
over a series of years all kinds of

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:59,659
worked examples this is all video right

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,450
so if you don't understand what it is

00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:07,120
that your teacher was trying to teach

00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:11,059
you can go get one of bazillions of

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,899
videos simple arithmetic banking and

00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:19,039
money he's branched off into biology

00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:23,029
right look at all this stuff is Sal Khan

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,820
a professor of Education he's not right

00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:29,600
is he a teacher during the day is that

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,149
his day job it is not and yet this one

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,370
dude just from sitting down and saying

00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm going to put together videos of all

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,490
this stuff that I remember from college

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,770
and i'm going to bone up on the stuff

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,350
that i don't remember because i just

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:47,299
don't see that anyone has done this so

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:52,539
i'll do it right and that's why he is

00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:52,539
now one of Bill Gates's favorite people

00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:02,419
and that's why Bill Gates is introducing

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:05,230
Sal Khan at TED Talks and is also

00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:13,429
investing tons and tons of money into

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:16,390
the thing that Sal Khan started so so

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:19,730
the idea here is to ideas here actually

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,850
idea number one you don't have to be an

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,309
educational professor write an

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:28,580
educational professional to create

00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:30,110
useful educational resources if you've

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,429
got some sort of sense and smarts and a

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,220
good plan and you're motivated right

00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:35,870
that's lesson number one right and I

00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,820
mean let's be fair Sal Khan is a really

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,049
smart dude but none of the stuff he's

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,559
teach I mean you look at those things

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:44,840
and it's like you know he's just he's

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,250
just explaining how things work it's not

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,250
it's not that it's not that complicated

00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,940
background could have done this it's

00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,740
just that saw was the guy who decided to

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,290
do it right it's like you look it's like

00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,700
oh

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:03,120
done that and she did and now he's

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:04,170
famous go right there was the second

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:11,160
point there that I just completely

00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:13,230
forgot ah how is this but oh that's so

00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,430
the question is how is this fun for kids

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:21,300
that's a very good question well first

00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:24,480
of all the answer is that it's not

00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,960
necessarily super fun for kids but it is

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,820
more fun than having to sit and remember

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,710
all of the end right down and take notes

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,770
and read and remember and read it all in

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:36,720
the book when you're stuck and you can

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,180
just like what was that I don't know let

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,800
me go ask Sal Khan you know and he gives

00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:47,010
a ten minute thing so it may not be a

00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:49,050
lot of fun but it is effective right but

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:52,410
no it's not that fun so what would be

00:31:49,050 --> 00:32:00,930
fun our games would be fun games would

00:31:52,410 --> 00:32:03,180
be fun games would be fun so there's

00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,340
been a lot of educational games all

00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:08,580
kinds of educational games that have

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,750
been produced mass what was the name of

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,180
the game you played when you're a third

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,590
and fourth number munchers did anyone

00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,670
else play number mantras when they were

00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,920
in the third and fourth grade look at

00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,900
that look at all these people who played

00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,160
number munchers and did that not teach

00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:24,510
you everything you needed to know about

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,880
math right there absolutely really kind

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:30,120
of enough to add right let's something

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,200
right enough to man enough to manage the

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,200
Fedora budget right

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:43,330
right and lots of kids remember these

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,100
games right they remember the east

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,000
coasts are the things because games are

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,920
sticky right games are sticky they stick

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,990
and there's there's all kinds of flash

00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,590
games that are out there ah but flash

00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:58,180
right clothes horse can't get to it and

00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,490
there's all kinds of abandoned weird dos

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,980
games and you know weird funky java

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,870
games and you know there's there's a lot

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:08,380
of the great canoe games that are that

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:11,320
are you know good and fun but and here's

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,530
where everything goes who only runs on

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,010
like point one percent of the desktops

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:20,410
in the world who write tough thing to

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,870
have to say at southeast linux fest

00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,270
especially when I was a Linux guy for

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,220
years and years but the reality is that

00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:30,640
if you want to achieve massive

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,230
penetration using open source you've got

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,620
to go to a platform that everybody has

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:40,350
and that platform is now html5 right

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:43,450
it's open it's almost as good as flash

00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,400
google has put a crazy amount of money

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,140
behind it right and anything that Google

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,570
puts a crazy amount of money behind you

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:55,660
can safely bet is going to win right hey

00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:01,120
dude it is what it is I'm just saying

00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:05,050
right and can run on this as well as it

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,300
can run on that right and whether exo's

00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:11,350
whether Oh LPC's achieve massive

00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:13,540
worldwide penetration or not these

00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,670
things are going to achieve worldwide

00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,710
penetration right the time will come

00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,090
when the when the cost of goods sold on

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,560
one of these things is going to come

00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,680
down to the point where this is

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,930
available in third world countries right

00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:31,720
and you think they don't use this stuff

00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:34,540
for everything they can so this is a

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,870
game in html5 I wrote it in about three

00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:41,470
weeks not from scratch because I'm a

00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:43,360
 but basically i took a code a code

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:48,460
base from a from an open source game

00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:54,609
called Akihabara right which is an html5

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:57,060
aiming engine I guess now I'll turn the

00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:57,060
sound on

00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,970
this gets really annoying when you're

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,170
developing by the way so patches welcome

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,820
right if you know how to make an OGG

00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,550
file using a track or something like

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:21,730
that feel free to contribute some music

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:23,680
let's play on easy right so understand

00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,320
what is involved here this is this is

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,410
not rocket science right this is

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,760
JavaScript it's a little bit ugly so it

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,890
helps if you kind of know your way

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,460
around JavaScript but I am by no means a

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:38,680
JavaScript genius I just took a game

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,870
this is basically exactly what the game

00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,280
I built it on looks like I didn't change

00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,810
any of the sprites I didn't change any

00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,120
of that stuff i just changed in dialogue

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,940
and added some puzzles right who to do

00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,070
to do to do mm-hmm learn math become a

00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:56,620
legend whoo yay so I'm gonna wander into

00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:59,680
this sort of yay who want a quest dude

00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:03,610
do you know you've got dialogue and

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,550
characters and you know it's uh you know

00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,320
and it and this is this is html5 and

00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,290
people have frequently said I thought

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,210
this was a flash game right except it's

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:19,300
not a flash game because with a flash

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:23,710
game you can't do this well apparently

00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,840
with this you can't do this either it

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,150
opened a new window and your windows or

00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,650
oh wait here it is I've got to drag the

00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,330
window back over to the right desktop

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,060
because we've got the multiple come on

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,090
there we go look at that see all these

00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,470
libraries right and this was written and

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:43,920
this is the great thing about open

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:48,010
source this was written by a dude who

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,470
was writing this to do his own there's

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,660
this like game designer game jam thing

00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,760
and he wrote this game engine to

00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,620
basically make cool stuff for game jams

00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,270
and then he was going to take this and

00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,460
turn it into like facebook games things

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,110
like that right and he just wrote all of

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,940
this code and then just sort of gave it

00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,470
away and said okay let's see what you

00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,750
can do with this right he's an Italian

00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,280
guy is very sort of his english sounds

00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,280
Italian when he types

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,330
you know and then I sent him a note at

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,920
one point and I said yeah I'm thinking

00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,360
about using this as a platform for

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,150
education games and he's like that's

00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,150
crazy I never thought of that you know

00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,620
cuz ya if you should see this someday

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:36,340
I'm sorry too I hope I'm not slandering

00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:42,100
you it's a good it's okay my princess is

00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:43,420
another castle all right you know and

00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,220
none of this is I mean this is all

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,440
fairly readable if you've done any

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,260
programming at all right and i'm at shim

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,720
okay i'm not people in this room who

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,640
have had to use my code can attest that

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,060
I'm not what you would call a skillful

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,020
coder right and yet I put all of this

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:06,600
stuff together probably in a matter of a

00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:08,980
few a mountain dew fueled weekends right

00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,180
so we go down lets you know and lets it

00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,500
let's actually let's play the game a

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:16,180
little bit let's see how it works right

00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,100
five alive you know want to escape the

00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,660
level of Bob do something or other walk

00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,970
over only those numbers that are

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,320
divisible by five hmm can I then go to

00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,270
the red button and the stairs will go

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,280
can I do that right is this this kind of

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:31,030
stuff that that a kid might understand

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:36,010
right you know am i a professional game

00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:39,460
developer I most assuredly am NOT and if

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,410
an idiot like me can do it then just

00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,830
about anybody with some basic JavaScript

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:46,810
skill can you know start with these

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,360
fairly basic kinds of things and make

00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,790
all kinds of really cool stuff right

00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,430
where did it say divisible by 3 so 3 4

00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:58,930
is divisible by 3 right yeah 7 that's

00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:03,130
visible by 326 that's divisible by 3 so

00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:05,400
no you fail it oh alright well let's

00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:08,190
then do that yeah what I talked to her

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,190
what does she say now I don't remember i

00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:14,470
attack you oh I can't get to her oh damn

00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,550
I'll coat sorry alright that's how I've

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,830
talked to her from over here now I'm

00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,840
just gonna oh there we go is a number

00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,390
divisible by 3 you i told you that

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,650
here's a neat trick add the digits

00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:33,220
together do you get

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:35,730
36 or 900 that's kind of cool hmm right

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,160
so there's a little pedagogy in there

00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:44,830
just a little bit it's not that hard

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:47,140
right we convince ourselves and I would

00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,000
argue sometimes with the help oh I'm

00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,150
going to have to do it again we convince

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,820
ourselves i would argue sometimes with

00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,440
the help of Professor professionals who

00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,680
are deeply invested in what it is that

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,960
they do for a living that we can't do

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,670
those same things because we don't have

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,930
the training or the background where the

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:11,650
smarts right and to some degree that's

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,880
true but to a large degree it isn't if

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,360
there's anything we've learned in the

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:21,160
open source world it's that motivated

00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:25,690
amateurs can produce code that can

00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,790
surpass the the abilities of the the the

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,150
greatest bunches of coders around right

00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:35,890
some grad student in Finland because

00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:37,210
he's got a you know a assignments he's

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,130
working on and he wants to play with

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,720
something cool and he's got the whole

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,560
POSIX standard sitting there just

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,580
waiting to be recreated by himself you

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:52,690
know you know and it's it's a ridiculous

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:53,860
idiot thing to try to do but you know

00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,080
what else you going to do on a Friday

00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:03,010
night when your wife is playing

00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:04,840
farmville right so oh hey my class is

00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,730
complete what am I going to go do now am

00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,900
i doing on time by the way because I'm

00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,920
not really going to talk much more I'm

00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,550
probably just going to play a bunch of

00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,910
games now the village are there any

00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:19,150
questions any so at the end of this by

00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,980
the way is probably going to be a pitch

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,930
right i'm gonna i'm going to ask if

00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:27,130
there's anyone here who's interested in

00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:30,940
this kind of thing right because here's

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:32,380
the thing and there's a there's a really

00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,300
bad at talking and playing at the same

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,430
time hold on I got to get through this

00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:43,590
level

00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:48,580
are you the one they call factor yeah oh

00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:50,950
you know I am old man there are many

00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,420
monsters here they're very strong we

00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,960
have heard that you know how to cut them

00:41:52,420 --> 00:42:01,510
down to size oh really a factoring sword

00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:03,130
what is that you know you know is this

00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,780
is this going to be fun for a kid I have

00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,710
no idea until I find kids to play it

00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,450
right this is still an idea right I

00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,390
think I happen to think it's a really

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:16,180
good idea I I happen to think that if I

00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:20,050
find the right help and if people sort

00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:23,710
of agree that it can be an incredibly

00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:26,500
powerful idea because again this is this

00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:29,230
is like maybe maybe 60 hours of total

00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,580
investment in in development time over

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:35,440
the lifetime of all the things that I

00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:44,080
built here oh it's the red pig I'm going

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:47,320
to attack the red pig out up so we had

00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:50,530
four hit points now he has to ow all

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,900
right yay money and you can see the

00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:54,490
upper left I've got my ex to factoring

00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,200
sword I'll go back to my regular sword

00:42:54,490 --> 00:43:00,400
you to do oh I'm really bad at this game

00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,690
bad at all games oh that one has eight

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,930
hit points all right so I'll go back to

00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:12,700
my factoring sword and up up up up aha I

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:15,670
kill you now I'll attack you 63 wait a

00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,990
minute wait multiple of three what is

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:22,830
that where's my three times oh well

00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:25,000
that's an arrow out of it do me no good

00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:29,950
not sure how I get out of this actually

00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,650
did I even finish the end of this oh I

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:42,580
think I'm gonna die very soon here these

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:45,940
things are fast what's that I don't know

00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,710
it's that one I'm learning maybe would

00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,900
that be what a kid learns I don't know I

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:54,810
think that's what I was trying to impart

00:43:49,900 --> 00:44:01,510
oh I got a 3x sword oh oh oh now game on

00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:06,850
now we go tear it up bam bam oh oh I

00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:10,570
gotta switch to my 3x or there we go all

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,680
right games are fun you know even when

00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,020
you're supposed to be giving a talk

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,030
right you just rather play the game

00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,920
because the things that came over cuz

00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:24,370
I'm a horrible thought awful at

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:27,610
everything i play alright that's a good

00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:31,420
that's good so what does an idea like

00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:33,750
this need to succeed alright and that's

00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,850
an open question because I don't know

00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,920
right i've got as and there are a few

00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,510
things that I do know right and these

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,950
sort of come to the structure of how

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,950
educational resources are packaged and

00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:51,010
made available and the progression from

00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:53,110
one skill to another right one of the

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,480
great things about the rigorous world of

00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,120
education is that there are standards

00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,830
galore right there are kind of too many

00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,180
standards in fact and every state has

00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,710
their own but there's an initiative

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,250
going on called the common core

00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:07,660
curriculum framework well it's quite a

00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,120
common course something I don't know

00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,310
what goes at but common core and the

00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,890
idea is to have all of these states that

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:17,140
have different curricula that are like

00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:19,150
subtly different you know and differ in

00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,740
like three words in this substandard in

00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,540
two words and you you learn this one a

00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,490
year before you learn this one to try to

00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:29,680
get them all to adopt the same standard

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:31,780
right an open unified standard is a very

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,030
important thing when you're trying to

00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,160
build great big things and fill lots of

00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,830
holes right so if we wanted to produce

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:43,960
games like this for every learning

00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:46,840
objective through eighth grade right we

00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,260
actually have one list now instead of 50

00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,910
where you can actually

00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:53,510
look down the list and say do we have a

00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:55,430
game that teaches this concept no so you

00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,700
know let's put a bounty on this one or

00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:00,980
you know and we can have a little grid

00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,540
right and when we tick off all the

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,030
little boxes on the little grid suddenly

00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:07,520
will have an open source browser

00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:10,130
available video game that can teach

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,570
every concept from kindergarten through

00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:16,880
eighth grade right I would love to have

00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:20,000
the time to do this myself but I'm a CTO

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,650
now and as a CTO I can sort of talk

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,270
about these kinds of projects and tell

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,400
you how cool i think they are and give

00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:27,260
you some of my thoughts on how we might

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,660
get there and maybe put together some

00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,300
hack fests and you know open an IRC

00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:35,210
channel a mailing list and all that kind

00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:42,470
of stuff but that's about all I can do

00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:44,480
right but that could be enough so so

00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:48,830
does that answer your question from

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,090
earlier is that fun enough maybe would

00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:53,150
you have played that instead of number

00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:55,150
munchers yes yes you would have will you

00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,260
play that instead of number munchers now

00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,940
do you want to do you want to have a

00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,450
challenge play that instead of grand

00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,450
theft auto

00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,590
you're too kind that's because Grand

00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:13,290
Theft Auto is hard this you probably

00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:16,050
have a chance of getting through I don't

00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:41,730
know I'm kind of done I'm kind of wore

00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:43,620
out so let me that's a good quote right

00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:49,680
so so what's the question there so I can

00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:51,090
report it for them how do you get this

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,460
to people's kids that aren't yours it's

00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:55,380
a good question it's a very good

00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:59,430
question the first thing you do is get

00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:01,020
it to a point where it feels like it's

00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:05,430
actually useful instead of a proof of

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:08,250
concept in my opinion but maybe maybe

00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:10,680
it's close enough I don't know um my

00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:14,130
good friend Sebastian who is it used to

00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,990
work with me at OLPC is now a red hat ER

00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:19,350
and I think he's now like 22 years old

00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:22,740
21 I met him when he was 17 when he was

00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:27,360
working on a sugar and I had no idea

00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:32,820
that he wasn't like a grown-up that's

00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:35,670
how it works he set up a visit with a

00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:37,770
school in the Boston area I can't

00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:41,280
remember exactly where it's uh it's an

00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:45,840
Academy it's a charter school that is

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,550
teaching a computer skills as an

00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,090
integral part of the curriculum from

00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,680
grades 7 through 12 so we're going to

00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,570
have 8th graders not only play in this

00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:59,190
but hacking on it hopefully sometime

00:48:54,570 --> 00:49:01,200
this summer my guess is that I have

00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:04,050
dramatically underestimated how

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,670
quote-unquote easy it is to do some of

00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:07,020
this stuff it's easy for me because you

00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,760
know I've been programming for long

00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,040
enough that even though i know i'm a bad

00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,210
coder I know what good code looks like

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,520
and I know how it's supposed to work

00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,570
right eighth graders not so much what's

00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,450
a loop

00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:21,610
and and yet you know we showed this to

00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,890
the teachers and those teachers said you

00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,020
know this is this is this would be a

00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,370
stretch for them but not a crazy stretch

00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,690
and our two or three brightest kids

00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,970
would love to do something like this

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,250
because you know what not only do kids

00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,530
want to play games but kids who are

00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,350
interested in computers one to make

00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,450
games and they want to make games if

00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,240
they're boys especially as bloody and

00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:44,410
gory as they possibly can all right so

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,940
you give him a little thing will teach

00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,910
some math while you're shooting the war

00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:52,240
pigs with the cannons and you know so

00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:54,400
you know how do we get him in front of

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,200
massive amounts of kids it's just

00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,690
there's no secret and you know you tell

00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,520
a friend friend tells another friend and

00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,710
that's part of what I'm asking help with

00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,000
right if this is a worthwhile idea tell

00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,010
your friends and i'll give you some

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,360
information about how to do that that i

00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,740
would have put in the deck that i would

00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:14,140
have written but i decided not to write

00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:20,320
a deck so long because I road half of it

00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:22,270
got bored with it max if I want to open

00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,860
a big open office window how do i do it

having run communities for a living I

00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,040
know all of the things that are required

00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,140
to make a community successful and I

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,380
know that I have time for very few of

00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:25,260
those things so phase one is just tell
