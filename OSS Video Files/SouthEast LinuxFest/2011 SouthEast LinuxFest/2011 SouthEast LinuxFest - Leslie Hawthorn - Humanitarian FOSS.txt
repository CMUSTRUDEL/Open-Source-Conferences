00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,269
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:38,270
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

make these videos possible lovely resume

00:00:38,270 --> 00:01:02,579
expressed in my own jealousy over having

00:00:42,570 --> 00:01:07,650
been for and also a little steep thank

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,510
you sir hello everyone thank you for

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,100
coming and i'd also like to take this

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,080
opportunity to thank all the organizers

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,280
of the southeast linux press conference

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:21,780
for bringing us all together today let's

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,009
give them a round of applause please so

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,540
today i'm going to be talking about

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,580
humanitarian free and open source

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,310
software and the purpose of this talk is

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,570
twofold one is to inform some of you

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,070
folks in the audience about various

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,299
humanitarian false projects that you

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,340
might want to consider contributing to

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,540
or encouraging other people that you

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,340
know to contribute to these projects

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,380
because it's great to write beautiful

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,460
code it's even cooler to write beautiful

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,040
code that helps other people live better

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,040
lives so to give you a little bit of

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,780
background about me this is a beautiful

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,670
picture of the state of oregon to which

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,470
i recently transplanted myself after

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,119
living for my entire life in Silicon

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,590
Valley I left Google in April of 2010

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,140
and then joined the Oregon State

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,509
University open-source lab in October of

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,290
last year already folks in the audience

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,000
familiar with the osu open-source lab

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,730
all right that's not enough fabulous i

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,680
have a purpose so the osu open-source

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,450
lab was founded in 2005

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,340
and it actually grew up sort of

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,040
organically as part of the central IT

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,000
department at Oregon State University

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,370
basically we had some data center space

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,870
it wasn't being used and we had a lot of

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,180
friends at various linux distributions

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,950
who needed hosting so from that humble

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,870
beginning in 2005 we've grown now

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,040
toasting over 100 open source projects

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,530
many of which you've no doubt heard of

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,859
we host Colonel org the linux foundation

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,250
apache drupal and a lot of other awesome

00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:43,079
stuff nagios stuff you guys like so

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,760
usually you're hitting our ftp mirrors

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:49,079
when you're downloading something yes

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,209
and the obligatory thing we are entirely

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,530
done or funded so you know if your tax

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:53,760
return says that you should do something

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,970
nice you don't think of us there you go

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,419
the end for the sake of full disclosure

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,889
for this presentation I am on the board

00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,599
of directors for the sauna software

00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:07,950
foundation I'm an advisor to the

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,290
humanitarian Foss project and I openmrs

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,810
is hosted by the osu open-source lab and

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,209
i've had beers at least one or two of

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,069
them you know with just about everybody

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,690
who I talk about in this presentation so

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,769
they're all my friends but that doesn't

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,510
mean that they're not super awesome he

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:27,479
shouldn't help them all right this quote

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,760
from mr. Cruz jr. is actually in

00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,229
response to the use of ahana software

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,810
which is a disaster management software

00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,180
suite during the Philippine mudslides

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,709
two years ago the reason that I'm

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,060
showing you this quote is because I do

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,199
think that part of the power of

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,239
humanitarian free and open source

00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,280
software is saving lives and in a

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,750
completely literal sense but I also

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,669
think it's more important to take a more

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,790
expansive view of what he managed Harry

00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,530
and free and open source software is my

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,079
introduction to open source about ten

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,909
years ago was somebody introducing me to

00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,000
a computer that had this big foot on it

00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:03,000
but I'd never seen foot looks kind of

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,129
like this and when I was curious about

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,019
the whole foot thing I was informed what

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,129
open source was and that there are a

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,989
bunch of developers all working together

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,639
collaboratively to produce software that

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,979
people could use whether or not they

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,479
could pay for it and that all really

00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,120
made sense to me and I think from the

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,440
broadest most expansive view of free and

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,740
open source software as a humanitarian

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,990
effort if people have a need for a tool

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,540
that they can't afford our community

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,410
efforts

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,460
possible for them so the first project

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,460
that I wanted to talk about today was

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,440
coho this probably doesn't fit into the

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,540
traditional sense of humanitarian free

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,340
and open source software but I like the

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,020
project I think it's really cool it's

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,510
actually the world's first integrated

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,030
library system so the software tracks

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,850
book checkouts and metadata on library

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,980
collections pretty cool it was actually

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,900
created by New Zealand in response to a

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,130
y2k bug that they found in the

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,010
proprietary software that they were

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,900
using in 1999 and when they went to the

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,250
vendor and asked them to help them out

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,950
with this bug they were basically told

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,960
hahahaha yeah no thanks or you can buy

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,210
the new upgraded version for way more

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,920
money than you can afford and by the way

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,020
the new version doesn't actually support

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,310
accessing the system over dial-up so all

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,980
of your libraries that are on dial-up

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,800
namely all of them yeah we can't really

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,120
help you out so the Kiwis being

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,110
resourceful people that they are decided

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,110
they were going to roll their own and

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,280
koha was born and it's now deployed in

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,480
hundreds and hundreds of libraries

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,190
worldwide and in fact in 2007 the

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,690
Vermont state legislature was in a very

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,100
similar bind they were using a

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,570
proprietary library management system

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,630
for all the collections in the state of

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,400
Vermont they went to the vendor ready

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,220
for an upgrade simply couldn't afford it

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,930
and switched over to co-host so one of

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,190
the largest installations of Koha

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,660
anywhere in the world is actually the

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,940
state of Vermont which ones it runs all

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,590
of their library systems if you'd like

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,870
to get involved because you know you

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,610
know or love librarians there's you are

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,450
all there and we can also talk about any

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,710
of these projects after this

00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,250
presentation I can get you in touch with

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,510
the developer team sap internship

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,820
openmrs this is one of my absolute

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,110
favorite projects how often do you get

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,970
to hang out with open source software

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:17,370
writing doctors you do ok cool what do

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:17,370
you guys do ok how about you

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,139
that's also so I met the folks from the

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,340
openmrs project when they applied as an

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,690
organization to google Summer of Code

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,210
and I got to know a lot more about their

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,980
work it's an electronic medical record

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,600
system if you consider what we're going

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,150
through the United States right now with

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
the VA open sourcing Vista looking for a

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,080
custodial agent to take over that and

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,080
you consider the state of our own yes

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,850
respond to the RFP exactly if you

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,500
consider the state of electronical

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,580
medical records in the united states the

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,220
fact that one of the most sophisticated

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,500
systems out there already open source

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,060
was actually created for use in africa

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,070
by doctors who are trying to do aid work

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,010
there and ensure that patients were

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,300
getting proper health care for HIV

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,620
because most of their records were taken

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,810
on paper which then gets covered with

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,000
water eaten by rats etc not particularly

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,979
pleasant the other really great thing

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,690
about openmrs is since it's designed for

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,430
resource constrained environments it's

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,270
actually effective in a multitude of

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,190
these cases and the other great thing

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,450
about this project that has been

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,880
particularly interesting for me to watch

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,410
is they have actually formed a

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,570
relationship with a government of rwanda

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,640
and put in place a training program so

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,530
that local developers are trained to do

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,530
capacity building and actually are then

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,090
employable to work on openmrs on behalf

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,550
of the Rwandan government so in addition

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:44,110
to this being a drew software it's also

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,110
been aid of an economic development type

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,390
the Sonata Software Foundation everybody

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:54,110
remember the horrible Indian tsunami or

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:56,300
is that too long an hour at time Jerry

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,280
remembers excellent so the Sonata

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,979
Software Foundation actually came out of

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,380
the Indian tsunami in response to that a

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,789
bunch of developers and Sri Lanka banded

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,770
together and decided that they needed to

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:07,940
create some software to manage the

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,160
devastation in their country and then

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,660
they wanted to share it more widely

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,729
sahana has grown into three products now

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,320
and it Kevin covers the gamut of

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,750
everything from disaster relief and

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,000
management from everything from managing

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,770
your shelter inventory helping you find

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,030
displaced persons helping you reconnect

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,600
people with their families when they

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,000
have gone missing due to a disaster and

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm on their board and they're fantastic

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,490
and right now what's particularly

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,349
interesting for those in

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,940
who may not be developers Sahana is

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,709
actually looking to add more to their

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,099
community in terms of folks can do

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:43,469
translation localization documentation

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,550
they've got an awesome and very strong

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,649
developer community and they're looking

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,670
to branch out a bit more so if you and

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,959
the audience or someone you know is

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,130
looking to get involved in an open

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,660
source project but they're not really

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,130
ready to jump in on the coding side this

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,720
is a great place for them to start the

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,209
humanitarian OpenStreetMap project

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,080
anybody heard of this has everybody

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:05,339
heard of openstreetmap all right so

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,260
these folks are a lot of fun there the

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,910
hotties I didn't give them that name but

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,820
I think it's amazing the humanitarian

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,910
OpenStreetMap project is a subset of the

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,760
OpenStreetMap community and these folks

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,200
are basically creating all kinds of

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,779
their taking open street maps geo data

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,370
and applying it for a variety of

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,250
humanitarian purposes everything from

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,850
crisis management to election monitoring

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,230
etc these guys right now I think they're

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,399
most interesting project that folks in

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,700
the audience here would be excited about

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,410
they're working on creating an interface

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,570
so that if you have offline satellite

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,420
data and then you reconnect and you need

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,500
to repopulate information on a map they

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,140
want to get that done it's a non-trivial

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,070
problem so I don't know if any folks are

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,670
interested in that sort of thing that

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:53,910
should be exciting more from the

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,529
academic angle how many of you folks are

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,640
completely self-taught versus having

00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,490
gotten college degree is completely

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,899
self-taught hackers couple how many of

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,560
you folks study computer science okay

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,470
mechanical engineering Electrical

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,700
Engineering other engineering okay so

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,020
I've noticed in the open source world

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,260
and you folks can correct me if I'm

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:16,589
wrong but there seems to be a general

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,760
consensus that to become a really great

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,290
hacker you kind of learn on your own you

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,060
don't really need to learn this stuff in

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,209
school you guys feel like that's true or

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,440
not yeah kind of all right so what I

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,360
think is particularly interesting about

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,310
the humanitarian Foss project is it

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,079
actually started because of a single

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,320
professor at Trinity College in

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,510
Connecticut named Ralph Morelli and he

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,870
put together this consortium of schools

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,750
to teach college students to program in

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,660
an open-source way and the point of it

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,129
actually was to pursue an NSF grant

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,529
about broadening participation in

00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:50,480
computer science so the actual purpose

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,550
behind the creation of the humanitarian

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,259
false project was the result of several

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,490
studies that have shown that women and

00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,959
other underrepresented groups in

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,319
computer science and engineering are

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,180
more driven to participate if there is a

00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:07,279
goal in mind which has a social value so

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,110
thus far to date these folks have done

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,079
contributions to go specifically around

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,759
accessibility openmrs this hana project

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,899
instead they put together some software

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,040
for the instead group who are working on

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,899
medical problems for folks the

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,949
developing world as well and they've

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,199
also done some pretty amazing

00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:26,300
applications that have gotten a lot of

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,980
attention the does anybody remember the

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,449
apps for Healthy Kids contest that the

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,750
first lady announced a couple months

00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:34,339
back yeah so they're actually one of the

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,779
award-winning applications they came up

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,420
with this really cool android app called

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,579
work it off and you can take your phone

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,589
and say like I'm eating a delicious

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:44,180
Krispy Kreme donut bread pudding with

00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,730
seasonal berries which is totally on the

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,689
menu in the bar and I don't recommend

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,600
you eat it because it's really really

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:53,029
good and it'll tell you great you just

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,759
had an awesome bread pudding in order to

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,740
work that off you need to do 300 sit-ups

00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,480
so the idea is to reinforce the behavior

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,490
that if you are in putting this many

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,889
calories and yourself you're gonna have

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,209
to do a lot to work it off another one

00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,949
of their award-winning applications is

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,930
also actually called first responder

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:11,329
this was in cooperation with Google and

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,069
there's a gentleman in the New York

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,430
office at Google incorporated who is a

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:18,560
volunteer firefighter and there was no

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,850
actual useful way to organize all the

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,439
volunteer firefighters in his

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,720
neighborhood so he got together with the

00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:24,949
folks at Trinity and within a weekend

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,269
they put together a first responder

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:29,240
application that's going to be used by

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:32,899
the city of New York any folks here

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,339
involved with academia at all please

00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,509
persuade your professors to host a

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,769
chapter of what are these some of the

00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,050
most amazing code that I've seen have

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,490
come out of these folks and this is

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,290
actually a group of small liberal arts

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:45,290
colleges this is not your mi T's and

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,819
your CMU's this is you know a consortium

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,990
of about twelve liberal arts colleges

00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:53,120
all up and down the East Coast so

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:55,649
they're doing great work anybody heard

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,570
of engineers or that word

00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,829
this isn't strictly open source but I

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,089
did want to bring it to focuses

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,399
attention because it is more of an

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,720
academically based project most folks

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,310
who are affiliated with engineers

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,589
Without Borders a bunch of student

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,760
groups worldwide folks get together do

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,790
cool stuff for people all over the world

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,959
and if you know young students that you

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,980
would like to encourage to do awesome

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,000
things for the role this is a great

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,959
student group for them to get involved

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,550
with or to start on their campus and

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,970
last but not least everybody heard of

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,380
random acts of kindness I see a lot of

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,839
heads nodding for folks who aren't

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,779
familiar with random hacks of kindness

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,680
this is a it's a nonprofit organization

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,089
that was put together by several

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,670
different corporations with the goal of

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,589
creating worldwide simultaneous hack

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,410
fests that solve problems for Humanity

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:44,889
and the last random hack of kindness

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,420
weekend was June 4th and 5th a lot of

00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,730
excellent applications came out of that

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,949
and really this is working code within

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,260
two days that's actually useful to solve

00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,190
real-world problems if you're interested

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,870
in getting involved in the future

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,269
there's going to be a global water

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,709
hackathon in October of 2011 the

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,139
specific dates haven't been announced

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,389
yet but it's meant to solve the problem

00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:06,130
of access to clean and healthy water for

00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:08,110
everyone on the planet in whatever way

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,440
the participants get together and figure

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,279
they can work on it and there was

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,310
another point I wanted to make about

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:18,790
that it's rh ok org I'm sorry to put the

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,190
robe and that wow I think I talked

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,940
really really really fast I totally

00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,940
blame the diet coke

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,220
yeah well you know that was a little

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,300
extra sugar let's not talk about that so

00:14:29,220 --> 00:15:13,740
do you guys have any questions I

00:14:30,300 --> 00:15:33,390
apologize for combination yeah we are

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:36,780
all ok I would have no idea what you're

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,010
talking about mr. Carter I'm working

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,580
with you i'm working with you I'm

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,580
empathizing

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:24,120
really no I totally agree with you that

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,050
there's a huge disconnect and I think

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,030
one of the things that's been most

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,560
interesting to me having worked with

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,330
students in the google Summer of Code

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,010
primer it was very much removed from the

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,840
academic side of things and then

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,360
actually going to work at a university I

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,660
think a huge part of the disconnect is

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,890
that typically professors feel like what

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,480
they're trying to teach his theory and

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,980
its theoretical and we are teaching you

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,990
to be a computer scientist not a

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,910
software engineer and I think that a lot

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,290
of that disconnect comes comes through

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,740
later on when we're talking about

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,330
actually programming because hey I'm

00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,800
going to do this thing is very abstract

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,660
way and in terms of real-world

00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,010
application wait I'm going to do that in

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,840
my first mix months on the job and

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,450
flounder and flail about and maybe not

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,920
do as good a job as I'd like I'm working

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,900
with a group of students at Oregon State

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,280
University right now who are working to

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,450
revise the undergraduate competing

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,730
curriculum will see if that get some

00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,890
uptake specifically to include things

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,210
like open source Python programming

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,150
because not everyone needs to know Java

00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,400
apparently these days who knew so yeah

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,960
so we'll see how that goes and I'm

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,340
looking forward to posting some news

00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,010
updates on the OSL blog about that

00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,210
process and all of the curricular

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,140
materials that are going to be developed

00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,550
that for that are going to be creative

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:36,230
commons so other universities can use

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:36,230
them it's a beer o'clock yet yes sir

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,039
if i may ask my colleague Deb if she

00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,419
would mind talking about some of her

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,419
experiences w

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,090
that's definitely one

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,890
girls computers

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,180
yes we have a huge budget

00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:22,169
Oh

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:19,910
great and in terms of other programs for

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,290
high school students I definitely wanted

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,300
to have to share experiences with us

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,550
because I know that she and marring put

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,010
a lot of work into that Google actually

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,330
holds I believe it will now be annual a

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,370
contest for high school students to

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,710
participate in open source projects it's

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,420
called google code in and basically the

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,400
idea is that open source projects that

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,070
participate produce a list of bite-size

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,110
bugs easily manageable tasks that allow

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,570
people to come in be immediately

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,670
productive be paired with a mentor get

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,170
up to speed quickly and learn to

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,090
contribute to that project in a way that

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,100
isn't terribly intimidating and isn't

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,450
off-putting and also with mentors who

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,940
understand that they're working with you

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,620
know young people and you know perhaps

00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,780
the off topic channel is not where to

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,210
invite them for example so i think

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,530
that's that's pretty cool and then the

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,520
other thing is in terms of just the

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:09,320
actual curriculum for high schools the

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,240
one thing that is great is that the

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,160
computer science teachers association of

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,960
america has really recognized the fact

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,180
that they need to do a lot more advocacy

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,710
work to make sure that computing and

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,380
technology and not just here's how to

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,540
use a spreadsheet for example needs to

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,100
be taught in high schools part of their

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,540
resolutions for this year was to work

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,220
with the National Science Foundation to

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,200
roll out new programs in that area and

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,870
there's actually specifically an NSF

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,770
grant called siiii 21 for anyone who

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,680
would like to look it up on their

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,940
website which is specifically geared

00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,710
toward how

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,299
being University researchers develop

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,490
curriculum courses and actually teach

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:45,139
those courses in high schools to help

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,120
students actually get exposed to

00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:49,039
technology and for those students who

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,019
are really adapted it to be able to go

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,340
on and take the AP computer science exam

00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:55,159
whether or not it's actually offered in

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,169
their area so I definitely see progress

00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,860
happening there i think it's slow but I

00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,679
think we're headed in the right

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:04,549
direction which is a wonderful thing

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,320
siiii dash 21 I think it's computing

00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:08,889
education for the 21st century is what

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,889
it stands for

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,290
well and I think too that it's it's

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,200
particularly difficult because if you

00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:47,500
just if you consider the pipeline for

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,210
educators in general there are people

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,130
who will make very strong arguments that

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,780
if you are at a depth computer scientist

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,760
or technologist there's no reason for

00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,110
you to go to academia when the corporate

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,390
world will pay you substantially more

00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,830
and if you consider that that's the same

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,150
would be true of high school teachers as

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,540
well I think that it's just it's a

00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:06,460
difficulty that market demand is not

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,280
necessarily always reward altruism in

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,600
dollars and some folks have you know

00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,780
bills to pay that are higher than that

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,400
which they can do on an academic salary

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,530
this is why you should all start clubs

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,750
in your town so that these young people

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:22,150
can come to them and learn more from all

00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:26,980
of you not that I have any opinions on

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:33,040
this or anything yes sir wow that's a

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:45,250
really long time for me about open Vista

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:46,630
hmm what would you vista yeah there

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,640
isn't a relationship between vista and

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,140
open in Amara's and so except insofar as

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,270
they're both electronic medical record

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,730
systems the reason that I was bringing

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,650
up Vista when talking about openmrs was

00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:01,720
because I think that it's it's actually

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,370
pretty interesting that we have American

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,200
computer scientists who are also trained

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,820
as physicians working out of the reagan

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,830
street and shooting Indianapolis Indiana

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,660
which is actually the first place in the

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,210
world that electronical medical records

00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,170
were ever kept I saw the vax machines

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,950
down in the basement that have the

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:22,150
records from way back in the day hmm

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:24,520
Regan street so you have American

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,230
computer scientists and doctors creating

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,090
open-source electronic medical records

00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,820
software for deployment in Africa

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,870
because they're trying to handle the

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,370
scourge of HIV there and now you know

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,080
seven eight years after that project is

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,090
founded now here we are talking about

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,950
like let's take the largest possible

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,720
electronic medical record system

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,830
deployment in the world which is Vista

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,240
for the VA and let's open source that

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,799
let's improve it for everybody because

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,970
obviously this is going to solve all of

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,220
our health care problems or at least a

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,700
great deal of them and I I just think

00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:00,000
it's I just think it's interesting to

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,260
watch the way that our value systems

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,510
have shifted in this country around

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,279
those ideas and cost savings and how we

00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,539
handle patient data this is one of those

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,919
things I geek out on it late at night

00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:21,779
which probably is totally interesting

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:23,190
game yes sir you know um you know to be

00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,870
honest with you that's not totally my

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,490
area of expertise I think that there are

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,200
people who can make like dramatically

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,789
good you know arguments for open car

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,730
models versus completely free software

00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:35,309
models and I'm just happy some of its

00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,809
open source I consider that okay you

00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:38,039
know it's not a full victory but a

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:43,309
little victory is better than 0 victory

00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,309
at all any other questions folks

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,090
okay yeah absolutely we actually host

00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:20,669
the kinect open source community it do

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:22,230
so the community portal yeah no not that

00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm aware of I think it's really more on

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,249
a I mean there's you can you can make

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,659
the network's larger depending on your

00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:29,580
use case like you know there are

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,139
deployments that take in data for Oliver

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,789
Wanda or that focus on a specific

00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:34,139
hospital are specific medical clinic

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:35,759
that you can then sing to a larger

00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:44,779
database and compare data but it's not

00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:44,779
the same ideas connect anyway else yes

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,960
so a couple of different things happen

00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,999
depending on the situation most

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,090
frequently with the humanitarian

00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:07,440
OpenStreetMap team geo data is required

00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,509
to do a variety of these humanitarian

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,629
applications because of a certain crisis

00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:15,059
and either folks discover that the map

00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:17,070
data is not available at all and then

00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:19,080
they browse volunteers to go and

00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,700
actually do the mapping at that time and

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,259
also help them to make sure that they're

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,409
not going to be impacted by the crisis

00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:26,969
that's happening they also work with

00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:28,379
vendors to try to negotiate to get the

00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:31,469
map data for free or to get a license to

00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:40,259
use that content is that answering your

00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:43,499
question effectively hmmm yeah anybody

00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:46,639
else my dear friends it's beer o'clock

00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:46,639
thank you very much for coming

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,749
what about this I can help you like it

00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:09,320
we have the same problem what would

00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:09,320
happen if you do lyrics like

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,170
that's what the word

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,170
you

00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,360
I

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,700
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,289
all we do is hosted computing to us the

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,240
cloud is just the next generation of

00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,190
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,230
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,309
we're in a unique position to really

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,440
help bring these two worlds together

00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,779
these different sets of technologies and

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,090
to help companies embrace this new world

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:46,100
and this great new tool that allows

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,679
faster innovation not only is it about

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:54,279
us being responsive and accountable but

00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:56,919
it's about us doing more for you webos

00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,470
nos that works the way that you do

00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:04,629
