00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,240
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,720
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,720
make these videos

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:12,250
hello sorry that you guys are going to

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:19,210
have to hear my high-pitched voice even

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:22,840
amplified thanks for coming began my

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:25,409
name is Chuck pain if you are on any of

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,590
the open seas of sites and you ever see

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:33,220
the Nick terror pup that's me and I tend

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:40,479
to cause a lot of animosity with people

00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:42,369
in our group because I am NOT 112 to be

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,319
quiet I'll also but today we're going to

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:49,979
talk about when the coolest things has

00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:53,380
come out of the open system community

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:57,429
for those of you who may not know or may

00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:01,630
know opensuse used to be sponsored by

00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:06,280
novell we are no longer sponsored by the

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:08,530
Bell because attachment bought us or

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,420
bought novell and one of the things that

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,410
they did was they split us off so now

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,260
years ago there was the company souza

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,970
again there's company souza but one of

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,459
the coolest things about novell when

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,250
they were sponsoring us that you know I

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,470
know a lot of people gave them flat

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,470
because you know they signed an

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,220
agreement with Microsoft and all that

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,890
which make them the bad guys

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,620
really they are one of the biggest

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:44,670
sponsors of a lot of open source them

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:48,370
how many guises Banshee Banshee is

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,160
funded by development Nobel is very big

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,140
into open source and stuff like that

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,010
well a couple years ago they actually

00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:03,130
were working on a software package

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:07,480
called Kiwi okay and kiwi is the

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,750
backbones to Susa studios so throughout

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,130
the presentation when I'm talking about

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,160
how we build stuff in that you'll

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:20,370
probably hear me talk like key Kiwi is

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,870
open source so if you're working on

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,700
another linux distro and you would like

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,459
to do something like this a studio

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,610
you're more welcome to go download kiwi

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,030
and do your own your own thing in fact

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,220
which is really weird because i heard

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,880
last month redhat finally came out with

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,739
something similar to what we have half

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,480
but in studying he was the backbone they

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,680
were of their own stuff when they're

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,959
gone why guys we already did the work he

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,660
could have wouldn't grabbed it so like I

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,060
said today we're going to talk about

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,489
developing applications and the new way

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:04,120
of doing things how many guys are

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:06,160
developers how many have more than four

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:12,250
computers at your house because you need

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:15,130
them for testing okay the reason i ask

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,600
that is I missed that bin and a lot of

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,739
my friends they come over they're amazed

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,060
because I have a mini net

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:24,970
my house happen 10 computers my wife is

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,539
non stop complaining because right now

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,430
summertime I live in Georgia my room is

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:34,330
equal to what the heat is outside

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,880
because of those 10 computer Susa Studio

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,949
allows you to create configure and

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,009
update your applications without have

00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:45,669
actually running any hardware in your

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:50,169
house it is up in the cloud if you want

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:53,020
to use the term cloud okay and your can

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,380
go through you select the packages and

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,150
all you want to do so let's talk about

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,250
creation when you're talking about the

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:05,229
CSIs to do since the studio is the front

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:08,740
like I said anybody can sign up it's

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,780
free you don't have to you know sell

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,770
your soul to anybody all you have to

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,590
have is some type of open ID account I

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,130
have a gmail account and that's what I

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,840
use to go in and sign up one of the

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,699
things let me give you a little key on

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,610
signing up when you go out and find out

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:31,990
and the initially sign up if you tell it

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,430
to go ahead and now I forgot what the

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,190
button is but there's a button you click

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,400
to say Cynthia and an invitation if you

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,039
do that you get you'll get in real quick

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,000
if not you're wait a while so there's a

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,370
secret to getting into okay Kiwi like I

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
said it's the package that is built is

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:55,690
built upon Python and Perl we'll talk a

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,500
little bit about that does anybody know

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,349
what yastas are many are juice you ever

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,590
heard that phrase why don't you tell

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:04,590
someone

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,830
just enough OS so anytime you're when

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,530
you go on this is the studio if you just

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,210
want to make it real quick I so use it

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:26,760
and credit auto Yas is our version of

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,790
kickstart so if you are a red hat person

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,030
and you're wondering what auto biasa is

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,610
auto else is what we use for doing

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,190
kick-starts so these are all in helping

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,170
building the creation of the tools and

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,390
some of the tool filters like I said

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,370
it's on site arts up in the clouds you

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,580
don't have to worry about having

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,250
machines to build out all your code all

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,300
the packages are up there you can do

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,270
your configuration online okay and once

00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,180
it's up there you know as long as you

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:05,040
have your your template you can go back

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:09,330
to the anytime one and update Kiwi again

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,760
like I said is a limit imaging building

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,880
system it is open source it doesn't

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,220
young anybody who is working on

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,870
something they can use it to set up it

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:25,320
supports creation and many images form

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,530
we do I'll go a little bit more detail

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:34,800
later but we do quite a few if you go to

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:38,340
Kiwi Burleigh OS de you can download it

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,940
from there it's mostly written in perl

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:46,770
and like i said it is engine behind Susa

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:49,830
studios one of the things that you know

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:53,760
like sit on open studios Kiwis the core

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:59,400
all our packages are up there these are

00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:02,880
the currently the format's that we

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,820
support you can upload your own vows and

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,920
scripts and it's very easy if you know

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,830
how to use XML

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,810
go through and configure it so let's

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,450
talk what you guys came to hear about

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:22,610
CSIS to do ww studio com there's the

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:25,340
destra are that's the logo for for CSIS

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:28,690
studios when you come to the page you'll

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,930
see nice little settings like this

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:35,650
little brief what's going on talking

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,000
about Awards when the cool things is

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,430
this doesn't have a picture of it but

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,190
they have the gallery if there's

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,070
something you're looking for someone's

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,750
probably already built it we have so

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,580
many people using this last year we had

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,630
a contest to see who can build the best

00:08:49,580 --> 00:09:02,510
applications using cissus studios one

00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:05,240
guy created a browser disk it loves up

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:09,530
wine and loads up so that you can run

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,360
safari ie all these different is like 24

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,850
browser and the whole reason he did it

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,520
was he was a web designer and he wanted

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,310
something that would load up all the

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:23,240
different browser so he could test his

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:26,870
code another guy created a application

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,570
that's for doing web design now we're

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,330
not web design graphic designs another

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,880
guy who does wipe communications you

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,060
know voice over internet IP he created

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,340
one where it launches its own little

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:44,000
Astro bollocks so if you're curious go

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,340
take a look up there you know a lot of

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,990
people are sharing it and likes it my

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,850
image doesn't have it but there's a low

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:55,400
link called gallery that you go look at

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:58,670
when you login to Susa studio you hit a

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,190
home page basically you'll have your lap

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,010
tar says how much this place you have

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:08,210
your my way novell is so generous to

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:11,930
everybody they give everybody 15 gigs ok

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,899
play around one the nice thing is

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,880
because so many people are using it your

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:19,250
images will stay up there for 30 days

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,520
whatever you built after 30 days they're

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,620
removed but the template of whatever

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,480
you've appliance you built will stay

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,850
there indefinitely so if you need to go

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,230
back and rebuild it you click the build

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:37,430
button rebuild it and you go on so when

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,620
you look after you you know log into

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,970
your own page this is kind of the flow

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,160
that you go through you're going to

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,140
select a template you're going to add

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,360
the software packages you want to add

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,490
you're going to go to your configuration

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,920
you're going to customize it and then

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,120
you're going to run your app and create

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,029
your image and guys if I got too fast

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,580
just let me know okay if you have any

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:04,160
questions we will do questions at the

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,860
end but there's something that you want

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,279
to ask feel free okay I'm here for you

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,810
guys so you know you interact with me

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,110
all your heart with you and everybody

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,940
walks way to acknowledge all right so

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,880
again like I said your gallery is all

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,350
the images that you built okay all your

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,920
applications you can create new

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:27,350
applications news about features there's

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,050
the Susa gallery and the system big

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,670
studios as you can see I took a quick

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,790
snapshot of some of the stuff that I've

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,430
been building two years ago I talked

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:41,089
about susa studio or actually i did a

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,310
ceaseless to do dis for alpha which was

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:47,480
the Atlanta Linux festival when I was

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:50,930
talking about the open Souza community

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,880
but I actually use this for developing

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,279
stuff like I carry around with me I

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,610
don't

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,449
here today my normally carry two USB

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:04,499
sticks with me one is a server disk our

00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:06,269
server USB stick that well by trade I'm

00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:08,490
justice admin and every tool that I

00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,309
possibly think of it I would need for

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,100
emergency if a box goes down I have it

00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:16,889
on there and I can get up from it the

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,860
other one was I was like well me see

00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,019
what kind of crazy stuff I could do

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,600
since my nicknames Tara puff yeah it's a

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,350
play on where was I had grill all these

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,720
little gothic pictures of build a

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,439
district looked young something for me

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,959
when I was at the travel channel we were

00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:40,319
thinking actually about creating live

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,480
distro discs for people to use if they

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,980
were out in the field if their laptop

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,269
let's say their hard drive went down

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,329
they could boot up at least with it ok

00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:53,309
continue working because like I said

00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:57,629
create these things and we almost had it

00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:59,160
done I was amazed that at first they

00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:00,930
were kind of hesitant but after showing

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,879
him a couple details of what we could do

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:09,000
and what packages they need they're

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:14,550
pretty cool your templates we do have

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:18,600
open seas 11 dot 14 up there which is

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:21,839
our latest and greatest demo if you are

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,089
one who wants if you're writing stuff

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,980
where the Enterprise Edition chooses

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:29,459
Studios it's very nice that the fact

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,819
that we say hey we're going to give you

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:35,879
the opensuse software up there and all

00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:38,519
the packages for it and we're going to

00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,490
give uses the enterprise of minutes okay

00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:46,829
so you can go through and pick both

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:49,399
roads and under each one you can select

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,689
your different stuff again like I said I

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,970
don't know how they get juice out of

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:58,529
this but that's pronounced juice just an

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:00,610
fos gnome or KDE or minimum X a server

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,800
or if let's say

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:08,380
you are someone who has been working

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:11,470
with Susa for a good time okay and you

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,600
have an auto Yost template and you want

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:17,829
to pull it up in there so that you could

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,589
build it and you know let's say that hey

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:23,950
yeah i understand it if i use Sisters

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,740
Studios I can create my image and use it

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,220
to push the Amazon Cloud Lee or not we

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,709
do have that filter feature built in

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,360
well you can import your Kiwi or your

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,880
auto balance and do it and each one has

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,899
at and this was just to kind of show the

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,930
examples of stuff that we have upgrading

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:47,230
is very easy most of my applications

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,050
that I start building were built on 11

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,269
not one and for me to upgrade the

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,640
application it was simply there was a

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,560
button and say click and it would in the

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,300
background and updated all the packages

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,760
for me and when I felt it so now that

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,949
you kind of picked a template that you

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,420
want to build stuff on and more for this

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:12,100
presentation we're going to use opensuse

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,769
just because you know I don't get paid

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:20,050
by novell i'm not selling susa

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:22,000
enterprise so you know they it's pretty

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,829
much the same thing so but I'm going to

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,260
talk about what I know so we're going to

00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:30,399
talk about opensuse I selected the

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:33,310
server one you have you go to your next

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,010
window where it's going to have start

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,079
your software your configuration your

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,750
files and your building you've selected

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,430
your template now and in the background

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,640
kiwi is already starting to build this

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:49,089
XML file this saying okay since we're

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,370
going to use the server we're going to

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,430
already put all the files that we

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,560
considered to be a server it's in this

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,790
nice little xml file and we're going to

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,880
start going through here we're going to

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:06,160
start adding it well the next thing is

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,160
well I want to okay I'm looking at the

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,899
software that they have for certain

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,920
first thing I noticed is that they don't

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,750
have apache and i need y'all want to

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,220
have a patchy so that it that way I can

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:23,009
you know set up a temporary yo lamp

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,899
server or you know I want to create a

00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:28,139
firewall so i can go start going through

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:33,360
and selecting packages let's say that

00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:38,040
there you know i need to add a file well

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:41,189
let's say if i want to use the open yeah

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,350
in an s you know maybe they have an RPM

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:45,269
or a tarball I can go through an ad that

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,550
through there they got an RPM and it's

00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:51,540
on my desktop I just hit click auto it

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:55,769
loads it up there and it's there ok if

00:16:51,540 --> 00:17:00,930
it's another RPM fine or let's say I

00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:04,289
want to add open nebulous you know their

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,000
repository for opensuse click I add it

00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,280
there now I have all those pulled in

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,949
there and I can add it so it's not

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,990
limited to you what's within the

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,630
opensuse you can actually add stuff in

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:20,699
there and you can go through and start

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,289
selecting since the studio's is also

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,100
trying to make it very easy if you've

00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:28,439
never worked with software okay we're

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,990
never designed a distro it's going to

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,270
keep making resident of recommendations

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,100
now one of the things that I don't have

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,110
a picture out over here if you ever make

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,190
them safe there's a little red boxes and

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:44,299
a pop-up and since they stopped can't go

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:47,220
any further because you have conflicts

00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:50,990
please try to resolve the conflicts and

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,870
you can move on all right configure

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:56,220
configuring and personalism

00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,179
personalizing this is when you're

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,640
starting to get into how it looks okay

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,210
the general page is this where you know

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,740
you set up like your use

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,290
things like that your language your

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,380
firewalls personalization is where

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:15,160
you're going through let's say you work

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:18,130
for a company and you're developing your

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,550
own applications and you want it to say

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,620
my company well you're welcome to load

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,420
of your own image as the backgrounds

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,390
when it boots up because your customers

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,210
see it the only thing that you'll never

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:34,570
be able to get rid of is the little logo

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,280
de sitios about my sous estudios but

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,560
you're welcome to customize it any way

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,890
you want you can upload upload your own

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:45,640
logo and your own distro I'm at your own

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,620
wallpaper and all that stuff once you

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,260
kind of went through set up your

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,030
language your users your firewalls and

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,170
all that stuff and we uploaded the

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:58,350
images you know we've done that

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,350
customization he now can come and set up

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,210
what stuff you're going to use are you

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,670
can have you know if your lamp guy you

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,540
want to give someone a live distro with

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:12,580
your version of some cool PHP app that

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,980
you created and you only want to run on

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:19,000
this live distro well you can load up

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,000
your sequel database if you want to use

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,810
postgres you can use postgres if you can

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,290
note up upload ace a sequel dump or a

00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:34,660
dump file and then you can add user name

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:38,140
and password again background as you're

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,970
doing all this kiwis I haven't t25 your

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:46,360
XML template that you're going to be

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:49,540
using for building okay next you're

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,100
going through and you're building it

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,120
because keep in mind since you are

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:58,450
building you know an application on top

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,880
of this distro you have to kind of tell

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,210
it's stuff like do you want to auto

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,870
login do you want to Auto Start programs

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,420
okay like

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:10,870
here okay good example here have you

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,900
ever used knoppix have you ever used one

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,250
the other districts like this this is

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,020
essentially what you're doing is you're

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,650
building your own life dis so these are

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:23,170
things like if you wanted it to launch

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,420
gnome or KDE or let's say you want to

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,700
use X face as your default window

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,500
manager and you want that to

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,680
automatically log in well that's where

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:36,610
you're sitting this stuff up disk size

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,760
and memory okay you can set that up and

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,260
like I said if you look here and it

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,650
tells you what you're set in your memory

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:51,460
up if you're using this for open bien or

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:54,070
VMware or then or kvm you set your

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,260
memory there if you're going to be

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,670
building an image for the Amazon Cloud

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:04,900
you can tell what your dis size is okay

00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:06,370
your dis this is the 0 if you're

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,830
building something that's gonna run live

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,990
and then you know these are things you

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,300
go through and like I said this is real

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,030
nice because if you are using some of

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,860
the virtualization tools this actually

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:22,890
saves you from sitting there with the

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:25,179
disk install the isos okay from the ISIS

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,770
everything's here to create your golden

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:38,190
image you can download it before Iranian

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:38,190
any questions so far no

00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:58,789
unless you share it everything stays

00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:02,210
within your gallery a gallery okay now

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:05,779
tar balls and things like that stay

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,820
within your group but rpms okay I

00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:10,519
believe that stuff goes out because I've

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,080
been told if you put stuff like they

00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,299
kind of do a check to see what's being

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,220
uploaded and if they see that oracle's

00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,169
been uploaded it because that is

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,419
something that you pay for in his

00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:23,570
proprietary they will go through and

00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:27,220
remove it I have a whole bunch of custom

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:31,249
scripts up there and I have my own roll

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:33,320
program that I've published up there and

00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:36,080
so far I hadn't seen anybody else using

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,309
in so everything unless you share it out

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:47,659
stays within your own gallery okay in

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:50,269
here first all right scribbs once you

00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,799
get your application your programs up

00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,929
you've customized it you're getting your

00:22:51,799 --> 00:23:01,039
image ready if you need to do things

00:22:53,929 --> 00:23:03,830
that you can run you know you can go

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,019
through and start creating scripts like

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,330
this one would be ran at the end of it I

00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:12,889
have a little firewall program that I

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:17,990
wrote myself and I have a nice script

00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:19,610
that I i use Kate to edit it and then

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,619
once I get it where I like it then I

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,860
copy and paste it in there and it runs

00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:26,629
it and it goes through and it creates

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,879
directories and puts the permissions on

00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:32,450
the directories it's doing w gets and

00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:33,110
curls you know out full stuff down you

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,600
know because

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,970
you know I want this stuff to be current

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:43,280
and things like that and you can also

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:46,100
tell it that you can have a script that

00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,960
when an application foods you can pull

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,900
stuff down and again if you're using

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,590
adios you know to give profiles of

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:57,080
provisions it's very nice because like I

00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,170
said now you're you're customizing the

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:05,120
image your your application it's more

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:07,220
than the way you want files like I said

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,400
any files that you ran you're asking

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,350
about that they upload and they stay

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,700
there and like i said i do i go out and

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,980
take a search and i haven't seen these

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,020
and they stay up here the nice thing

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,450
about when you upload files if you

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:26,390
needed to go to pacific directories have

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:28,700
pacific attributes and ownership you can

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,400
go through here till it it needs to go

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,370
to this directory it needs to be you

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,010
know 755 we need to be owned by this

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,190
user all this is done and again like

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:44,770
it's in the background it's being built

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:51,200
into your xml your Kiwi XML Tennyson

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:53,840
template so that you can do all right

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,220
this is kind of an overview of what's

00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:02,179
going on in the background okay so it's

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:05,480
again it's taking the stuff from the

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,850
repository image descriptions kiwi soon

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,240
to prepare its unpacking the images it's

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,520
doing the stuff and it's creating the

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,630
whole imaging back in the background for

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:21,460
you these are the steps that it takes

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:25,130
and oh sorry I don't I'm not the guy who

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,230
who wrote key we actually got to work

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,480
balance art from novella who wrote it

00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,809
and when I total it's going to give the

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,179
talk and sent me

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:35,759
to hear Alan's a great guy and like I

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,460
said this is the stuff that's going

00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,649
through and like I said the whole beauty

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,909
of all the Kiwi stuff is it's doing all

00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:48,960
the stuff in the background this is the

00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:51,450
creation steps Kiwi it reads the

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,490
information is that it's accessing the

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,039
packages that you need it's unpacking

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,960
them it's creating a nemesis age to run

00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,289
the configuration and creates the boot

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,389
images with unit d kiwi builds the

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:05,129
Pacific image to appropriate phone

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:08,820
format while depending on what you want

00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:12,659
to use and then like at the example Kiwi

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,600
create my stick to use a USB you know is

00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,759
the format that we're using and then

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,889
this kind of Shh heed the configuration

00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:25,019
tree that it uses okay can you Kiwi uses

00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:28,139
a directory structure for its

00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:31,559
configurations and these are the key

00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:39,389
files that he uses one it's crazy stuff

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:42,690
in the background okay everything in the

00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:44,460
background is XML and this is an example

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,110
what it looks like and the nice thing is

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,490
is once you create your image and all

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,919
that if you need to go through and make

00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:53,190
sure that it was done right you can

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,460
upload it I mean you can't go in and

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,619
take a look at it online so again more

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:05,580
about the Kiwi it governs the whole

00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:09,090
thing okay now let's talk about building

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:12,570
and publishing likes it currently these

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:17,429
are the formats that we support live cds

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:22,529
and distros our DVDs USB sticks and hard

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:27,990
drives VMware virtual box and kvm and

00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:33,419
those are all the dot VM k KD if I have

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,750
the extension right okay ya BM DK sorry

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,090
I'm Dyslexic attendant

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,460
amazon cloud image once again beauty by

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,870
using the Sisters Studios is when you

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,170
build your images and stuff like that

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:49,170
once you have a ready to go you don't

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:52,200
have to download it to your desktop and

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:54,330
use something else click a button and it

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,390
publishes automatically talk to your own

00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:00,090
to your arm amazon cloud count and

00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,550
everything's there we support open

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:06,180
virtualization format so if you are

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:12,000
using opening VPN or start open the end

00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:14,520
or VirtualBox Bull KTM's you can use it

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,640
there if you're using zen you can do

00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,309
that and if you need to create a

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,059
pre-loaded I so you can build that as

00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:27,450
well alright let's take a quick look at

00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:30,660
the different image types everybody

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,910
knows USB sticks you know a lot of

00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,600
people are using that back in the past

00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:39,420
it was really hard to write to a USB

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,980
stick in fact I remember when I first

00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,020
tried the first couple times it was a

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,990
nightmare because you follow the

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,900
instructions that someone put out there

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,880
one step didn't go right or if you did

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,590
like most of us like yeah take this isoh

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,350
write it to hear you got a a file format

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,340
that was really it doesn't help you much

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,080
you want this to be like a portable

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,880
workstation well we have this tool

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
called since the studio image you can

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,530
take your image right into whatever you

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,410
want be it a USB hard drive a hard drive

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,700
or USB station first time you boot it up

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,470
it's going to be a little bit slow

00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,100
because initially what it does is it

00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:23,550
takes the image okay let's say that you

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,610
created your imaged or after you get all

00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,450
your packages your images or two gigs

00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:35,059
once it it sees where it's writing into

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:37,590
it will expand out like my the emergency

00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:41,400
dist I took you guys I care

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:43,440
with me that is a 16 gig file so what it

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:49,610
did was it read that it was a 16 gig

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:52,350
stick and create the whole size you know

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:54,900
so it's real nice it goes through there

00:29:52,350 --> 00:30:00,380
and help you everybody knows VMware

00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,380
virtual box and KTMs so if you are using

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:06,270
vSphere once you get your image you can

00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,279
load up through the spear into your your

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,500
image or if you're using VirtualBox

00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:15,450
locally on your laptop you can use it

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:17,159
there or you're using KPN's Zen you

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:21,090
build yours end guess and you can use

00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:25,380
which is used by the Zen hypervisor the

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,230
open virtual format you know virtual box

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,390
is one of these and like I said open

00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:35,039
bien it's another one and it creates it

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:37,080
where it's very easy to deploy ok like

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,179
again I know everybody's talking about

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,039
today's the cloud day if you are using

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,720
Amazon you can't go through there it

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,960
creates it in the correct format so

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,270
there's no need to change it and again

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,640
pre-loaded Isis are great if you're

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,309
someone who's managing a computer lab

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,980
and you need to roll out something or if

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:59,840
you're using like auto Yas or you know

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,640
kickstart and things like that building

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:09,289
after you've gone through played with it

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,289
things like that you can load it in fact

00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:22,979
excuse me I'm going to go ahead touch

00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:25,570
you can press the button it builds and

00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:27,580
if you're using Chrome we actually even

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,700
have a service alert you when it's done

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,619
but like say you pick whatever your

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,929
default image is gonna be and you build

00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:37,269
that and once you build it the nice

00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:38,859
thing it that likes it and the whole

00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:42,309
reason I was talking about building your

00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:45,609
application in the cloud is once you

00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:49,989
build it you don't have to burn it to

00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:52,599
anything to play with it you can hit the

00:31:49,989 --> 00:32:00,159
test drive and you're giving one hour of

00:31:52,599 --> 00:32:02,499
time to work within the browser to to

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,080
work on your image and you have a

00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:10,570
limited network connectivity if you want

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:13,299
to use that so Souza studio has given

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,820
you everything that you need to do okay

00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:17,559
once you trust me out when I'm building

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,259
my image and all that I go through and I

00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:21,909
test drive it take a look and if it

00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:25,359
looks good i'll go ahead and burn me a

00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:31,299
couple other images just so i can have

00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:33,509
them and i can download now since if you

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:36,419
are someone who does a lot of

00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:39,849
programming and building application

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:41,649
change control is very prevalent well

00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:43,299
the nice thing that you can do instead

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:45,489
of having to go back through and rebuild

00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:49,659
this lovely application that you worked

00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:52,090
on you can hit clone both on your

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:54,700
gallery page and at the build page and

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:57,309
actually build yourself a clone of that

00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,080
image and go from there and work on so

00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:03,820
you can have your own version control

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,409
within there ok also remember how is

00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,499
talking about the Susa the assistive

00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:10,440
gallery where other people build stuff

00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:12,990
let's say that you find one

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,299
someone had built a super gamer disk

00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,340
they didn't put your game in in Game in

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,440
there and of course I know you guys

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,769
aren't even bill games but it's just an

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,710
example you could hit clone it goes to

00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:28,950
your gallery now with your name you can

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,720
now go in at whatever packages to

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,480
whatever that clone is and continue

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,419
working with so it's a great tool that

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:42,330
you can do that you can also put like an

00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:44,809
md5 check on it so that you can see how

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,809
things are going

00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,970
again likes a test driving if you need

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:06,130
to go through your virtual windows you

00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:09,190
can go through f1 f2 f3 there's your f7

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,970
you can run X in there and d come up

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,159
take a look and play with stuff

00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:18,429
control-alt-delete so you can resend it

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:24,879
ok and while you're there you can even

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:26,770
modify files it's real beautiful on the

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,030
page that on the build page there is a

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,210
thing where you can click and take a

00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:33,010
look at your files so if you're curious

00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,480
what's going on you know let's say you

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,990
load it up something but you're not sure

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,750
why you get there well you can go into

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,940
the configuration file I'll by the way

00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:47,740
every image that you built there's a new

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,359
directory on your / call studios and

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,879
everything that's going on with your

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:56,020
bill will be there and it'll be up

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:57,310
underneath that config dr. stop xml it

00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,380
could take a look at it you could

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,980
actually take that xml save it to your

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:07,079
desktop edited and use that later to

00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:09,670
import it and build another application

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,800
let's say now that you've built an

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,170
application you think you have the next

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,730
thing to be grateful you know for

00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:22,420
mankind we've created a new distro that

00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:24,790
you think is very nice cherry that's

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,560
when your stuff like you said that you

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,750
know you have somethings proprietary but

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,030
you don't want people say as long as you

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,280
don't hit the share button it's fine oh

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,800
one thing I didn't mention back on the

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,150
configuration page let's say you do

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,569
share it you can put your own end user

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,210
license governing whatever software you

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:48,520
put up there so that way you're covering

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,800
yourself young this is the open-source

00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,440
version of it here please read this in

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,530
user agreement click blah blah blah

00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:02,319
continue so you can add that into your

00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:03,099
bill okay you can link your blog into so

00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:04,450
you know

00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,720
reading your blog and you want to go

00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:10,680
download it they can you can certify

00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:14,619
that this application is what I wrote

00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,239
and you go through and you certify it

00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:19,299
you fill out all the stuff so that way

00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:22,690
if I'm saying hey here's my open browser

00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:25,839
disk I've certified as it survived it if

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,849
somebody else named tear up up to 64 is

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,829
saying this is theirs and they don't

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:34,720
certify it you know that lying has a

00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:36,579
certification it's legit okay and then

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,970
once you do that you can do version

00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:42,130
controls on it so people know that

00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,660
what's the latest and greatest and it

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:48,549
gets listed out on the gallery so

00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:50,229
everybody can go take a look this is you

00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:52,109
know the browser box is one I told you

00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:56,859
so when you share it on the Susa gala

00:36:52,109 --> 00:37:00,660
gallery you know it's up there measure

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:04,059
all your stuff you have a brief

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,640
highlight of it who's it by where they

00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:10,930
can take a look and all that stuff and

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,789
like I said you can also I don't haven't

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,190
played too much for sharing and eat too

00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:16,900
but I think you can tell it where you

00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,729
don't if you don't with people upon your

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,029
stuff you can tell it not to but for

00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:24,489
most part since it is open stores source

00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:28,539
copyleft people can go through these

00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:31,059
your work cloning like I said talked

00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:34,299
about briefly great way for version

00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:37,049
control great way to take someone else's

00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:39,309
work make it your own and throughout the

00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:41,769
when you're filming stuff you will see

00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:49,599
where it says clone this application and

00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:53,979
you just click on it and go alright so

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:57,400
again susa Studio allows you to go

00:37:53,979 --> 00:38:01,539
through and create your applications

00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,350
online using open-source enterprise to

00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:06,340
as you

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:09,010
back home for the linux distro if you're

00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,020
one who likes tune their own stuff

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,670
you're welcome to download kiwi and take

00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:17,230
whatever destroyed you want and build

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:19,060
your own the before Red Hat released

00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,750
theirs the only other one that was where

00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:27,640
I was slackware had one out called slack

00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:30,040
SLA X where you go and build a live

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,860
district and stuff like this using

00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,730
slacker packages actually peg width is

00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:40,560
it's pretty nice if you're interested in

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:43,450
kiwi that's webpage you get it from

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,670
again it's easy access if you have any

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:52,150
of these open IDs in fact now there's

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:54,640
even more you can see that these are

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:59,710
references for kiwi you know where you

00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:03,670
can get stuff you know there's the

00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:05,680
sistas studio stuff and if you ever have

00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:11,290

studio itself is free you can use it if

00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:48,370
you are wanting to use it for commercial

00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:51,310
you know you would need to buy there is

00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:58,120
a commercial version of cissus studios

00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:59,550
that that you can purchase so that like

00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,540
you were talking about earlier about

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,700
proprietary you could buy this

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,770
commercial version run it within your

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,320
own shop build everything on there that

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:10,750
never goes out to the public it stays

00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,770
within it and you can customize it to

00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,770
any way you want

00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,670
I just brought this up so real quick

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,810
they want it to show you guys if you

00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:28,380
have any of your images that you built

00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:34,410
now i will answer more questions you can

00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:39,300
go back through here sorry i'm using my

00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:41,280
verizon phone right now you can go

00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:46,830
through there and any time go back and

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:51,210
rebuild it and you can upgrade it say

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:53,520
like a very upgraded mine to live it up

00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,380
for but if I let's say I'm having

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,109
compatibility issues this is a new

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:02,160
feature you can actually download it

00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:03,780
online and you don't have to go through

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,490
all the steps let's say you just want to

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:14,250
oh I'll chase them the customization and

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:15,750
personalization you can load up your own

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,260
images and it kind of shows you what

00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,260
it's going to look like

00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:31,049
these are the images okay and if you

00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,789
notice right now the download button is

00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:37,710
not there because I haven't we haven't

00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:40,529
built an image in like 45 days you know

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,480
30 days ago they removed it or actually

00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:44,309
15 days ago they removed it's all I have

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,940
to do is hit the rebuild button and I

00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:50,700
can go and if you're ever curious about

00:41:47,940 --> 00:42:01,079
how much disk space you have I didn't

00:41:50,700 --> 00:42:03,630
cover this in the slide used to move

00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,200
beyond your front page let me go back

00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,420
into you it actually has a little meter

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,630
bar to show you how much you 15 bids you

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:18,569
have any editor question sorry this was

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:23,789
the snus level one to show put you guys

00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:27,210
to sleep yes yeah you have 100

00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:30,750
applications can be infinite as long as

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:38,910
you're using it within that you know the

00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:42,170
15 gigs okay like just to show you guys

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,170
how long stuff stays

00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,750
I yeah I built this

00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:07,690
2009 I was passing this out at the

00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:10,460
Atlanta a linux of expert festival in

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:14,480
2009 and the other thing that's nice is

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:21,950
it helped the studio will also help you

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:27,700
keep your applications based upon what

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:27,700
version it is okay

00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,840
there is in fact one of the things I'm

00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:42,660
working on is I'm working on an e-book

00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,450
that anybody can download for free that

00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,370
walks through this when I was in LA I

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,280
actually gave a course teaching stuff

00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:52,800
but you know we were talking about

00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,540
cloning and stuff like that these were a

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,160
couple apps that were out there they

00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:59,190
were in the Susa gallery that looked

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,720
cool and i went ahead and borrowed them

00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:08,190
and you can see the names on them you

00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,930
know so like I said it's very nice and

00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,470
also played around with enterprise a

00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:16,500
little bit but it it's a nice tool

00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:18,540
because now what it's doing and that's

00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,300
one reason i was saying building your

00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:24,150
application in the cloud is you're not

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,940
paying the electric bill for running

00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:31,410
machines in your house anymore okay

00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:35,660
you're not paying for storage this is

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:39,900
totally free okay 15 gigs totally free

00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:44,310
you're not paying for CPU time to build

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,320
these out okay so essentially you could

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:49,460
be you know if you're someone who's

00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,950
working on things and let's say you're

00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,930
going around to different customers well

00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:58,620
the nice thing is is if you're in a

00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:00,270
customer's shop and you're hooked up

00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,150
into their network all you got to do is

00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:05,550
download the image that you need you're

00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:08,580
done here's your you know here's your

00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,470
storage and things like that and like I

00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,680
said this has been really useful because

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:17,940
I good example of why this has been

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,630
useful for me like I said by trade I'm a

00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:25,620
sysadmin and most of the shops I work

00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:28,380
for or red hat shops and last year I had

00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:31,530
a server where a hard drive went out but

00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,620
they need to get the data off of it the

00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:38,490
guys that were there were not keen on

00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:40,680
live distros yeah because I don't know

00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,330
what it is about true survive Red Hat

00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,130
engineers why they don't like

00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:50,280
he's an live desk so I was like I can

00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:52,320
get the data off of there how walked up

00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,910
with my trusty little thumb drive I

00:45:52,320 --> 00:46:00,470
slammed it in there booted it up did an

00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:03,090
F disk at this dash l found the drives

00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:06,210
course you know it being at Red Hat it

00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:10,830
was logical volumes did a quick scan to

00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:12,540
activate them mounted them mounted you

00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,030
know because also the nice thing is

00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,220
because this is a live distro the USB

00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:19,560
district stick it went out and said oh

00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,770
you have broadcom you know ethernet

00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,960
cards and you have you know these cards

00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,760
east card it's turning on all the

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,030
hardware for me so I don't have to worry

00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,460
about hardware drivers and all that I

00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:36,960
was able to get a you know dhcp address

00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:40,290
and found the nails copied everything

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,340
over there we weren't down days like

00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,890
these guys were because they were

00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:47,190
calling yeah we got to call dell and

00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:49,140
they'll send out a someone you know and

00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:52,610
we thought it was initially was a hard

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:56,540
drive I knew he was and was actually our

00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:59,150
controller had flaked out but because

00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,890
you know I was not using the

00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:05,820
controller's i was using something to

00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:07,110
access to one the disk that was yeah the

00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,510
mirror was broke but I still could

00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,490
access it I was able to get it off so

00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:13,740
it's nice that you can build stuff and

00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,710
like I carry this this thing with me

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,440
yeah because I've been in places where

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,750
friends have had problems with a you

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:27,990
know a windows computer and I popped it

00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:30,420
in use G part to get in there and run

00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,310
fix drive and it goes through and it

00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,310
runs a little check deaths and fix it so

00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:38,130
it's what since the studio is giving you

00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:43,260
as a developer is the tools now I know a

00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:45,720
lot will be like well you know I you

00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,030
know prefer to build my applications on

00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,620
an utter distrel well that's fine if you

00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,940
want something to test it live and you

00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,450
don't want to have to spend money for

00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,060
hardware he's the service one of the

00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,490
other

00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:01,360
app applications that were very proud of

00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:03,790
it opensuse and that this year we

00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:08,340
changed the name used to be opensuse

00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:14,590
build services and if you developed on

00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:16,690
ubuntu KDE or red hat or arc or any of

00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,700
the other distros we allowed you to

00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,650
build your application up in there and

00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,050
again it's up in the cloud and if you

00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,120
want it to take your package and then

00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,500
design it to build out for other distros

00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,780
all you had to do is click a different

00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,820
button and it built the package out so

00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,870
that they can be installed on there you

00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:38,890
can then take it and on there in fact

00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:40,510
we're having our conference and newburgh

00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,940
germany's here and one of the things

00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:46,420
that were calling is open collaboration

00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:52,240
and last year we invited you boon to

00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:53,860
fedora and Debian to come you know it's

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,770
even though it's Novans this conference

00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:59,170
was a late come share with us at first

00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:02,560
they were calling really they're kind of

00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,420
scared but this year there a lot of

00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,420
people are coming any other questions

00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,750
filter this thing and this is there a

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,090
little integration for you could say

00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,690
okay with me up to wide city with

00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:19,930
something all fresh of the bill for my

00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:23,380
believe he can is if you know I and i'll

00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:26,590
check with someone is i believe there is

00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,630
a repository linked to the open build

00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:31,650
services so if you can get the

00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:34,600
repository link from open build you can

00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,400
again under the package page add it

00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,250
there and then pull in the packages that

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,940
you need so yes we are trying to make it

00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,940
totally integrated

00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:51,960
do you more well guys thank you for

00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,400
coming I hope you learned something

about this I can help you like it we

00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:35,440
have the same problem full effort on the

00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,440
few years you gave me I thought

00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,710
let's put the word out

00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,710
you

00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:56,400
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,990
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,910
cloud is just the next generation of

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,890
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,839
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,010
we're in a unique position to really

00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,140
help bring these two worlds together

00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:09,480
these different sets of technologies and

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,790
to help companies embrace this new world

00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,800
and this great new tool that allows

00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:16,380
faster innovation not only is it about

00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:21,390
us being responsive and accountable but

00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:24,150
it's about us doing more for you whether

00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:28,170
less an OS that works the way that you

00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:31,940
do across all your devices HP Slate and

00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,940
