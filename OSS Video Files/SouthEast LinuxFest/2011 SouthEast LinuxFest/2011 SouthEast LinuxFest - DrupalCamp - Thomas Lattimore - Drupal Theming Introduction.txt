00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,610
so you know if that's what you're here

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,090

wrong room but just to start off with

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,570
you can find these slides so you don't

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,410
all that stuff at this URL is LBT dot me

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,430

front-end developer and really

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,869
specialize in Drupal that's where my

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,970
passion lies i really like drupal

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,549
theming that's that's what I enjoyed

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,729
doing most um if you want to stalk me a

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,329
little bit i'm known as t Latimore and

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,680
on drupal.org and twitter you can hit me

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,880
up there if you have any questions later

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,310
on and i'm the maintainer of the web 110

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,490
lightly textured and its humble like

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,670
themes on drupal.org you want to check

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,409
those out just free themes available on

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,960
drupal.org that I've contributed back

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:03,450
and let's get started so what we're

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,969
going to be covering today first off

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,530
it's just how the templating system in

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,599
Drupal works sometimes that can be a

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,060
little bit confusing there's a lot of

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,880
different template files

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,000
that go into what making up a drupal

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,340
theme and there's an inheritance and a

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,420
way that their structure within one

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,080
another and we're going to be covering

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,760
that just touching briefly on it we're

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,370
going to be talking about what it is in

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,720
definition like what is Drupal see me

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,599
what what is it and what it is not what

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,930
are we covering just some basic tools

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,660
how to get started theming just simple

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,940
things like code editor stuff like that

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm really going to try and break down

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,840
the basics of how to get started theming

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
like I'm going to really start out like

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,090
creating the directory adding it to the

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,420
proper place within Drupal really like

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,069
the bare bones so if some of y'all are

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,319
maybe a little bit more advanced theme

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,290
errs or have done theming before some of

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,150
this session might be a little bit

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,720
boring to you but I hope that you know

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,610
maybe some people trying to get into it

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,950
could find some useful information about

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,870
it and then we're just going to bail on

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,820
the slides and notes i'm just going to

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,280
can basically walk you through the

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,239
process of converting a static HTML file

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,549
to a working drupal theme but first

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,010
before we really dive in can I just get

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,280
a show of hands who in here has built a

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:39,269
drupal theme before all right all right

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,579
and who in here as maybe you've managed

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,680
to drupal site and either at least gone

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,940
in and changed the theme on a drupal

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,530
site or you've all right good good so

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,720
download one from drupal.org maybe

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,950
change the theme do that a developer on

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,150
your team gave you or something like

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,880
that so drupal theming divine define

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,799
this is how I really define it this is

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:07,200
my personal opinion on what it is some

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,600
would probably argue with me and there's

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,700
a there's a little bit of debate it

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,670
because the the whole idea of a theme ER

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,160
is it's kind of an odd niche because

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,720
you're a front-end developer but at the

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,130
same time you're also working with the

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,979
server-side language which is

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,030
interacting with PHP which is the really

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,560
back-end development

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,660
no you're not necessarily interacting

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,300
with the database that much a little bit

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,669
of bait about what it is I really define

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,160
is this Drupal's just this big fire hose

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,980
of data because it really is I mean

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,139
Drupal is really data heavy and we might

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,560
even get into some of that later on just

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,020
it is really incredible how much data is

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,660
exposed to the theme layer I mean it's a

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,340
lot really so you have all that data but

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,900
then what do you do with it when you

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,060
serve it up to the browser what does it

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,550
look like how does the user interact

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,960
with it how does it all tie together

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,450
that's what I really define is steaming

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,880
is controlling that just fire hose of

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,040
information and how it looks and appears

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,430
and how the unit user interacts with it

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:14,370
in the browser and Drupal's templating

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,710
system when you open up a drupal theme

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,229
you're going to see all these dot TPL

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,530
dot PHP files and there's a myriad of

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,410
them there's a beginning at the top

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,740
there's HTML dot TPL dot PHP then

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:32,600
there's page TPL dot PHP then inside

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,250
that there's region dot TPL dot PHP then

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,890
inside that there could be no dot TPL

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,990
and or there could be blocked not to

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,660
feel inside that depending on what is

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,729
placed within that region and so they

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,640
work kind of like the Russian doll

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,410
effect you've got like bigger templates

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,390
they don't necessarily more complex

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,280
sometimes it can be a really small

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,850
template as far as what it delivers up

00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,090
to the page but there's like this this

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,190
hierarchy of what's on the outside of

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,039
the page beginning with HTML and then

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,289
inside that with Paige and and I'll get

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,800
into that when we actually dive in and

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,800
start coding some and this next slide

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,550
kind of explains a little bit and

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
unfortunately this is a little outdated

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,110
I found this on drupal.org but I thought

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,720
it was a very good image just showing

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,690
kind of the inheritance of how joopa

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,500
things work this is outdated in the fact

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:31,140
that it was done for Drupal 6 and today

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,000
just to mention we are going to be

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,070
working on Drupal 7 just because that's

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,080
where things are going and there aren't

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,650
all there's some pretty major changes

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,630
but if you

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,669
learn drupal 7 theming than 6 is a

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,550
breeze because actually drupal 7 is a

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,710
little bit more difficult but it

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,500
basically works you have style sheets in

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,009
beginning first you have to have a dot

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,470
info file that is the first process to

00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:59,220
beginning anything you'd actually in

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,100
theory have an entire drupal theme that

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,690
is just a dot info file in theory

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,820
because Drupal has default TPL files and

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:13,350
then what we do when we create a theme

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:17,310
is we override those and like one good

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:22,590
example of just how you can theme using

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:25,320
very little team TPL files is the stark

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,919
theme that comes with Drupal 7 all it is

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,210
is a dot info file and style.css and

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,000
it's like a functional theme it's not

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,120
pretty but it is a working theme that

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,099
has no PHP involved at all and it's just

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,470
a really cool example here's the basic

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:44,250
structure you got your TPL files we

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:47,880
normally would have HTML PHP TPL dot PHP

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,190
above page in Drupal 7 but again as I

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,260
said this is updated then block the note

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,820
and then you have your template dot PHP

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,039
which is where you'll put all your

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,470
custom functions whether you're Oprah

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:01,820
overriding Drupal adding new variables

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,940
things like that and just your basic

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,919
other things like your logo screenshot

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,389
stuff like that and then anything else

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,310
that pertains the same theme whether

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:17,010
it's JavaScript images anything else

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,169
custom PHP includes and then when you

00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:23,250
have a sub-theme all a sub-theme is

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:26,400
basically is a theme and we'll get into

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,440
this in a few minutes as well is a theme

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,770
that just has written in the dot info in

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,810
your dot info file base theme and then

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,060
the machine name of whatever your parent

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:41,370
theme is and what that allows you to do

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:43,260
is inherit another themes settings and

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,810
functions and whatever functionality

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,450
provides so you don't have to overwrite

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,840
code in order to change something so if

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,070
I go out and download

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,290
contributed theme from drupal.org the

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,260
smarter thing to do is actually create a

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,240
base theme under that so that when the

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,880
community contributes back to that theme

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,370
that I downloaded I get to take part in

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,940
those changes without having to worry

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,130
about managing the code that I changed

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,870
in theme like all the custom CSS or

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:19,700
whatever I had to change things like

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:21,650
that um since the day I would say to

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,650
really understand where we're going is

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:28,810
you need a not thorough but basic

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:31,820
understanding of how HTML and CSS work

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,950
it's just kind of essential I don't

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,560
think you're going to get lost without

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,240
that but really to get started theming

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,600
you need a basic understanding of how to

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,010
layout stuff with CSS and HTML and do it

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,700
properly a drupal install in our case

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,010
today it's going to be Drupal 7 and a

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,130
good code editor this is very essential

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:58,880
like I really wish someone had told me

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,950
about like getting a good readable code

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,920
editor when I had first started doing

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,750
web technology coding stuff because it

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,090
would have made things a lot easier I

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,620
mean it's a very basic thing but

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,070
something that someone didn't really

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:16,940
teach me early on and I think it's just

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,880
absolutely essential and here just to

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,290
close out a little bit some projects on

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,940
drupal.org I think you should know about

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,820
if you really wanted to get involved

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,390
with seeming first one is mothership and

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,000
this is actually a its intended to be

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,880
used as a parent theme or a base theme

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,640
it doesn't really do a lot visually but

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,110
it basically makes theming and drupal a

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,620
lot easier in my opinion drupal does a

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,570
lot of odd stuff with CSS and things

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,200
like that that probably shouldn't be

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:53,270
done and many other things ad ads divs

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,550
and classes that aren't needed

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,440
necessarily and what mothership does is

00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,990
it cleans it up and we're actually going

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,730
to create a sub-theme of mothership

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,550
today another one's devel

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,510
which is it can do a ton of stuff that I

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:12,750
don't do it can like analyze page load

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:16,730
times and all sorts of stuff but I

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:19,130
basically use it to it like expose the

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,110
variables on a page it can basically

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,940
does a have some built-in functions that

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,560
just let you look at what's being served

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,540
up to the page and things like that and

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,510
then there's devel femur that's

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,760
basically like firebug excuse me for

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,760
drupal theming allows you to click

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,889
around on the page and see what variable

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,230
or function generated any given object

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,120
it pops up in this nice little

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,010
JavaScript window still a little buggy

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,230
47 so I'm not sure if I'm going to

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,760
actually demo that today or not in

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:53,519
Firebug like firebug is a firefox plugin

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,790
that also believe there's also a chrome

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,740
plugin for it as well and I'm sure

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,360
there's some other things for Safari but

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,329
I don't know how i would do drupal

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,500
theming without it and the reason for

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:10,550
that is in Drupal there are so many

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,829
classes and ID's that are placed on

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:16,079
objects that I don't necessarily control

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:18,029
they may be by a contributed module or

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,889
something that you know a custom module

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:26,850
a developer handed to me and I need a

00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:28,889
way to quickly view that and it I I

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,750
honestly like if if there's no other

00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,459
tool that you use out of these you need

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,829
to be using Firebug because it makes

00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:40,050
makes your world way way simpler and

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:41,910
that's it for the slides part before we

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,949
move on is there anyone that has any

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,170
questions anything that just went way

00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:49,860
over your head or you're like I mean no

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,930
question is too ridiculous I mean

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:57,750
honestly any any questions at all before

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:59,810
we move on all right let's get started

00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,810
then

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:21,060
alright first off we just have a

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:24,209
extremely simple just static HTML page i

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,000
did nothing complex about it i didn't

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,290
want the design to be fancy at all

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,759
because i didn't want it to distract

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:34,529
from what we were trying to do but

00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,089
basically you know it's just a two

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,560
column layout just kind of like what

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:41,180
you'd see on a blog nothing special

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,160
about it but to kind of talk about that

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,819
template structure the first thing that

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,980
we want to do when we're given something

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:55,230
from a designer or maybe you're given an

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,880
HTML file to convert or maybe even a

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,019
theme from another content management

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,699
system I've heard of that happening

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:05,279
before too and I've actually had to do

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:07,380
it is narrowed down like the different

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,839
sections of your seam that you're going

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,720
to have to break apart so like first off

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,670
as if we were overriding everything we'd

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,529
have the HTML tpo which is it wrap it's

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,589
the wrapper for the whole page basically

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:25,889
in a Drupal 7 theme you don't have to

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,329
alter or mess with unless you want to

00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:32,760
override it which there's really no

00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:34,740
reason to your information inside inside

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,100
your header tags basically from the body

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,560
up for those that understand HTML and

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,389
from the body down all the way to

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,750
closing HTML you don't have to mess with

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:47,730
that information at all you only have to

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,930
alter what's inside here that makes

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:55,230
sense and then inside that we have our

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,689
page TPL and that's basically you know

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,600
just this page structure and then inside

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:05,269
that we'd have a region which could be a

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:09,480
region can be a myriad of things because

00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:11,910
main content is a block in Drupal 7 for

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,610
those that are familiar with Drupal 6 it

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,949
was actually a hard-coded variable but

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,260
in Drupal 7 you print out a region and

00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:21,019
you place your main content within that

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,699
region so

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,879
inside a region you could have a node or

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:28,949
you could have a block either one so

00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,040
that would be like our main content that

00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:34,970
could be a block our main menu is

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:39,799
printed out through calling a function

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:46,589
and then just another region down there

00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:52,920
but one of the easiest ways to get

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:57,259
started is go to my root directory here

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,259
so you have a root drupal install and

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:05,699
one pretty cool thing is you have all

00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:08,790
your documentation in code when it comes

00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:11,069
to open source it's all exposed to you

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,049
you can look at the code and all the

00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:17,549
information that we actually need is

00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:20,220
right there in Drupal so all template

00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:22,559
files are generally placed in a module

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,980
folder of the module that they're used

00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,399
for and in our case today we're actually

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,049
only going to alter one template file

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,579
out of all those that i just mentioned

00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:36,089
we're only going to alter one of them

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:38,970
that's page TPL dot PHP because the

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:41,309
others we don't need to their default

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,889
state is perfectly fine there's nothing

00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:48,329
that we need to alter in them to to

00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:53,629
accomplish what we need to do today so

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:56,220
to reference that we would go to the

00:16:53,629 --> 00:17:00,029
root directory of your drupal install

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:04,470
and then go to the modules folder in the

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:08,819
system folder now very important very

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:11,909
important do not alter anything in this

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:16,740
folder at all do not just don't do it

00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:19,909
kittens die if you do it they do because

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,740
if you overwrite anything in this folder

00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:25,319
then next time you go to update Drupal

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,350
it will blow away all your changes you

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,850
will have no more anything you altered

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,440
within this folder will be gone the next

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,040
time you update your drupal install and

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,050
you don't want to do that

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,250
so all we're going to do today actually

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:44,110
is we're just going to open up this page

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:46,120
TPL file as a point of reference largely

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,970
just because there's some parts that are

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,150
that I don't want to take the time to

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,270
write out by hands just see right off

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:59,770
the bat there's this large section of

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:03,700
comments at the top that has documented

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,880
every variable that is printed out

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,280
within this template it's pretty cool I

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,670
think I've worked with other systems

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,620
like wordpress and wordpress has a lot

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,180
of documentation online but I think it's

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,880
really handy just to have it right there

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,290
available like if I don't have internet

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
access somewhere as long as I'm running

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,430
localhost and have a drupal install I

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,770
have the documentation available if I

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,450
forget something because it's a pretty

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,140
large file and sometimes going to be

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:38,670
easy to forget what the name of a

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:42,310
specific variable is and all right and

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:46,750
next we are actually going to start

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:48,940
working on our theme now that we've

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:55,630
opened up that other one just as a point

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:58,750
of reference so when you download a

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:02,880
theme from drupal.org or you create a

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:06,100
custom theme it should always go inside

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,460
the site's all modules folder aren't Li

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,830
not not modules sites all themes folder

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,830
do not put it in the themes folder

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,240
that's right off the group directory and

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,280
actually show you that real quick I'm

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,910
not really sure why it's done this way I

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,100
think it's pretty confusing to new

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,850
people don't don't ever mess with

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,400
anything in here yeah those are all core

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:33,250
base themes and anything you change to

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,860
them as I mentioned with the stuff

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:39,310
inside modules when you update Drupal it

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:43,020
would be blown away it will be gone so

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:45,549
don't do it put anything custom inside a

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:51,190
sites all themes folder

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:55,269
and we are just going to copy its basic

00:19:51,190 --> 00:20:00,549
HTML file we have or HTML file and then

00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:05,289
CSS as well into that folder and rename

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:07,690
it Drupal doesn't have any specific like

00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,340
you don't have to to name the directory

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:13,539
a machine name or anything like that you

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,809
can name it whatever you want i'll just

00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:15,809
put

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:41,419
and now what we're going to do is we're

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:41,419
going to rename this as page Cpl at PHP

00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:51,929
before we actually jump in there we're

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,250
going to create a new document this

00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,700
document is going to be our dot info

00:20:53,250 --> 00:21:00,240
file it's called a dot info file all

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,120
modules and all themes have to have one

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,600
it's basically it can do some other

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:12,360
things like that like can be used to add

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,039
CSS and JavaScript and can be used to do

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,539
some theme settings and some other stuff

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,890
but basically it's made it information

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:23,070
for Drupal your themes name whether or

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:27,179
not it has a base theme things of that

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,789
nature and the name of this is the

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,429
machine name of your theme and that's an

00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:36,659
important thing to remember so if you're

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:38,520
wanting to know what wanting to have

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,990
your theme have a specific machine name

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,820
or wanting to remember what the machine

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,950
name is you just have to go to the dot

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,539
info file and we're just going to call

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,539
it dcs see

00:21:51,940 --> 00:22:01,430
all right and now very first thing that

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:05,030
we want to add to our data info file is

00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:14,920
the name everything and we can just name

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:18,920
it dcs see painting intro the next

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,720
there's a description and these all

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:27,680
these parameters are listed on

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:32,120
drupal.org under a page called something

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,620
like default dot info parameters or

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,070
something like that I should know it

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,970
because I have to look it up quite often

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,100
but it's on there under the

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,530
documentation section under the theming

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:48,800
handbook it's one of the first pages

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:51,050
there and we're just not going to type

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,480
anything there because what you want to

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,320
the theming description actually can be

00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:01,600
pretty important like if your theme has

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:05,810
a parent theme that's one thing that

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,340
would be important to reference there or

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,570
just what the theme is intended for any

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,100
technical information that might need to

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,690
be known about it maybe modules that

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:26,750
it's intended to be used with something

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:30,230
like that and next we are going to list

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,780
the core and this is our whatever

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:37,520
version of Drupal were running if we

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:40,970
were running 6x it would be six dot X

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,770
instead of 7x pretty simple and one

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:49,190
thing to note is all of these well

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,530
actually not the description tag but the

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,310
name and the core are required with

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,790
what's called required parameters

00:23:54,310 --> 00:24:00,740
meaning that the theme like it won't let

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,070
you enable the theme without them being

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,260
there like

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,590
if I left core out and went to the

00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,330
appearance page it's a like this theme

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,190
is not compatible with this version of

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,190
Drupal because I hadn't given it what

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:19,160
information the proper information ready

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:23,610
to be compatible with with it alright

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:27,900
next we're going to list off the regions

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:31,830
that we work and we're going to have

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,110
just four regions here today and regions

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,510
are defined by just the name region and

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:43,290
then the machine name of the region

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:48,230
within the brackets there an equal sign

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:54,480
and then this here you can name whatever

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:58,380
if you wanted to I don't know print it

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:04,860
out as something different and like say

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:06,120
if you had a before content section or

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,920
something like that and that's what you

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,320
wanted to call it call the variable as

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,480
is in your theme but you wanted someone

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:19,080
on the block's administration page to

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,730
see it as a featured section on the site

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,530
for like the featured content or

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,320
something like that you can change the

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,840
name and I don't know I've done that

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:32,430
before where the actual name is much

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:38,130
different than the machine name and then

00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:41,640
content and this one is required believe

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,080
so yes believe it's required this is one

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,020
of the default ones and that's actually

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,490
where the main content of our page by

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,490
default is going to be printed out

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:14,520
and this is pretty important here i

00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:17,430
think sidebar first even though we only

00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,230
have one side bar in our theme i go

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:23,660
ahead and call it a sidebar first

00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:27,360
because that's the default value for

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:29,490
drupal meaning that if someone plugged

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,710
in this theme to their site and they

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,000
already had a block assigned to the

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:37,440
sidebar this sidebar first then it would

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,100
automatically pick it up does that make

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,690
sense it makes sense to any one of my am

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,850
i getting over anyone's heads or any

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,710
need me a slow down if you need it if

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:56,220
you have any questions by the way just

00:26:46,710 --> 00:27:07,980
you know speak up if I yes does anyone

00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:09,930
know how to do that in apt una it's been

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,860
a while since I've changed this anyone

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,860
know how to do it in aptana

00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:23,090
I think it's actually controlled by a

00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,090
theme

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:37,190
I don't know where it is anyone know

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:40,100
where it isn't he Clips yeah you

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:49,210
any clips users in the room no eclipse

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:59,560
users well I don't see it in here I

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:59,560
apologize about that there we go

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,830
no no

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:30,740
let's try that there is that better oh

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:33,750
that's way better I apologize about that

00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:41,070
now next and last region is going to be

00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:56,570
the knot fodder footer and then next we

00:28:41,070 --> 00:29:00,990
want to call yes really there is

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:04,470
interchangeable but there's ones that I

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,450
suggest using and that that is if you're

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,300
going to have a sidebar on the site then

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,630
call it sidebar first or sidebar second

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:16,770
and that's simply because say if someone

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:22,500
had the default theme in Drupal and had

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:24,810
a block assigned to a specific sidebar

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,570
on the page when they go and enable this

00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,430
theme I want that block to actually go

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,430
somewhere because if you enable the

00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,900
theme and that region doesn't exist on

00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:38,750
the theme you enabled then it just

00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:41,880
disables the block so I recommends using

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:44,820
this value content and sidebar first

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,660
which I actually I if I'm correct a

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,980
belief content is required I've never

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:54,870
run into it because it's always what I

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:57,300
call it anyways that makes sense but but

00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:01,920
I mean I could I could name this foo bar

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:10,280
or whatever I mean it it's completely up

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:10,280
to me to decide yeah any other questions

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:23,030
alright next we are going to add our

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:25,190
style sheets and this is kind of an odd

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:27,050
syntax here I think it's because in some

00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,560
instances you can reference a print

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:33,590
style correct yeah your efforts a print

00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,080
style style sheet there so someone's so

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,360
you can say like style sheets prints

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,420
instead of style sheets all I haven't

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,910
ever had to deal with that but generally

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:53,060
that's the syntax for it and then we put

00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:55,580
the path to our style sheet and this

00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,590
path is one of the really cool things

00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,570
about using the content management

00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:03,980
system you don't have to mess with paths

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:07,460
a lot and like where is your specific

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:10,190
CSS file in relation to where you are in

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:17,230
the site and stuff this path is relative

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:20,050
to our dot info file so just to show you

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:23,510
here's our guard info file you have the

00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:27,350
CSS and then within that we have to CSS

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:30,010
files that we're going to reference I'm

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,010
just going to copy this

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:49,549
and that is the bulk of our basic down

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:54,610
info file a white features forgot

00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:59,659
something in a theme you can have

00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:03,500
different features like a logo sitename

00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:07,100
site slogan and those can be enabled and

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,700
disabled from the theme settings page

00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,200
and today just for simplicity I just

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:21,230
decided to go with two different

00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:23,990
features and that is the name and these

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,610
are this is this is Drupal terminology

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,250
by the way this is not something I'm

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,520
making up here this is telling Drupal

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:36,280
okay this theme does have available to

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:41,840
it our site name to be printed out and

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:44,350
the main menu and that's it for a dot

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,350
info file

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,100
sit back stairs now

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:06,530
alright and now we are going to open up

00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:18,049
our page TPL dot PHP and all this is at

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:21,679
this point is just a okay yep the

00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:27,820
easiest way to test well first you would

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,820
go to the appearance page in Drupal

00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:37,210
unfortunately there isn't for everything

00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,770
and see here's the theme we just created

00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,450
it and there's no screen I didn't put a

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,059
screenshot file in there anything like

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,690
that but it isn't a lot of times if you

00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:53,240
have something missing then it will spit

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,429
out an error right here like this theme

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,419
cannot be enabled for whatever reason

00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:03,850
but it's not perfect like I think if

00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:07,580
like with the stylesheets parameter it

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,159
won't tell you if like there's been

00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,649
times I'm like why is my CSS file not

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,750
being added to the page and it was like

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:17,050
I misspelled style sheets or something

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:21,139
like that so it isn't perfect

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:23,179
unfortunately the easiest thing to do is

00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,510
if something's not working go back to

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:28,460
the handbook page on drupal.org and

00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,899
double check and make sure because like

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,570
sometimes the terminology can be there

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,830
is it style sheet or style sheets that's

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,290
supposed to be referenced about style

00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,790
sheets but I have misspelled it before

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,820
even after doing it I don't know I don't

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:43,369
know how many times and there's no error

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,869
it just your CSS file isn't being served

00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,869
up to the page which is really annoying

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:56,450
this is basic appearance page and all

00:34:52,310 --> 00:35:00,650
this is is a base install Drupal 7 that

00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:02,990
I've run devel module on and generated

00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:06,500
some nodes right here you'll see

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,000
mother's the mothership theme and I'm

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,440
actually going to reference that real

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,099
quick in my

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,079
dot info file that mothership seen today

00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,730
i wouldn't i can't really take time to

00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,150
explain what it does but it just makes

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:23,540
theming less of a nuisance especially if

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:27,140
you come from someone who has a lot of

00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:29,540
experience in HTML and CSS and you hand

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,700
coded stuff it doesn't make you hand

00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:35,119
code more but it kind of takes out a lot

00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:38,240
of the stupid in what Drupal does to the

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,619
theme layer in my opinion so all we're

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,579
going to do so what we're doing is we're

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:44,510
creating a sub-theme of mothership and

00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:46,490
that's all you have to do to create a

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,440
something right there so there's tons of

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,990
great parent themes on drupal.org that

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:57,260
do amazing stuff like the dynamic

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:58,790
layouts and like omega fusion Zen theme

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,319
those are that's just a name a few they

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:04,609
do some really cool stuff and that's all

00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:08,000
you have to do really to create a base

00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:10,339
theme but in some instances you may have

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,150
to copy some functions over and things

00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:16,460
like that for it to inherit everything

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:19,190
but let's get started actually working

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,890
in this page TPL file first thing we're

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,849
going to do is we're going to delete

00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:29,290
everything above and below the body tag

00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,290
and I looks like I already did that

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:37,940
because Drupal has already created a

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:43,190
file that handles all that for us called

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:46,450
the HTML TPL dot PHP file and that

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:51,160
handles all that like we don't have to

00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:53,540
mess with the header information or

00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,119
where style sheets should be planned

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,369
printed out and that kind of stuff

00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:04,310
because at this point Louis handling it

00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:10,609
for us so now we're going to enable this

00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:12,110
theme and set it to default as you see

00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:14,750
right there

00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:17,720
that's the static HTML file that we just

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:20,780
it's not working yet but what we've done

00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,900
is I'm at a completely different

00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,490
directory now and we in theory and I say

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,320
in theory because it's not functional

00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,540
like no matter how much content we add

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,250
we haven't told Drupal where to spit it

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:37,250
out on this page as of yet we have a

00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,790
working theme I mean you've gotten

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,800
started all your CSS is in the right

00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:46,040
place and now you just have to tell

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,870
Drupal where to print out the proper

00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,730
information in what place first thing is

00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:56,930
I'm not going to I'm going to try and

00:37:52,730 --> 00:38:01,630
not talk about the HTML structure i

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:05,560
chose for this because i could be here a

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:16,680
lot of time just want to stay focused

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:23,589
any questions up to this point ok

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:30,190
so drupal has what it calls a render api

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:33,220
that was around in six version 6 i

00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:35,200
believe for module developers but now a

00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,329
lot of it has been moved over to the

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,329
theme layer and it's a way of basically

00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,450
reaching down into PHP arrays and

00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:48,010
grabbing out information in a way that's

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,470
a lot easier there's also stuff like you

00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,490
can I won't get into too much detail

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,260
into that because I could spend a whole

00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,420
session just on the render stuff because

00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:59,319
i like the render stuff a lot but

00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:03,069
basically all we're saying is you have

00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:07,319
this big PHP dot PHP well it is PHP but

00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:12,700
you have this big page array and you can

00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:17,049
expose it using a print our function if

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:20,500
you needed to and read through it but

00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:23,170
every piece of content will almost

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:27,190
always be print through that in our page

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:31,510
TBL and what we're doing is we're going

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:37,329
to select the header from that region

00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:42,910
from that page array and what this is is

00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:45,670
it's referencing let me show you so it's

00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:52,950
referencing basically this from our dot

00:39:45,670 --> 00:40:06,760
info file that piece of information and

00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:10,690
then for for our site name first we want

00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:16,799
to foremost if you're if you have markup

00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:20,890
on the page you want to always wrap it

00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:23,740
almost always wrap it in a if state if

00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:26,260
in an end if statement reason for that

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,470
is is you you may have some padding or

00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,290
some something going on with that

00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:35,340
markup that you don't want it on the

00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:41,460
page unless a certain variable is set

00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:44,670
such as let's look at this and I can

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,890
show you so how like right right here

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,980
that and this is in this one that we

00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:52,140
grabbed out of the system module folder

00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,430
they've just run an if statement on to

00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,020
check to see if the site name is set

00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,390
that's all it does it doesn't check to

00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,820
see if it's empty which it probably

00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,380
could be empty if it's actually set

00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,609
because Drupal doesn't allow you to

00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:15,170
leave it empty so we're just going to

00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:17,940
say if site underscore name set then

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:23,340
we're going to want it to process that

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:25,140
piece of information and while we're at

00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:28,290
it it's good practice just to go ahead

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,440
and close that end if statement because

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:35,490
it's easy to forget about and then

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:40,250
within here then our anchor tag we're

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,250
just going to I think it's just a print

00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:04,710
and then we're going to go ahead and

00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:07,170
refresh make sure it didn't break

00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:11,999
anything hopefully not as you can see

00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:14,579
our title is changed and now just with a

00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:16,289
single variable it's outputting our site

00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:22,079
name instead of the plain text that we

00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:28,829
had in there I'm running out of time so

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:31,529
I'm going to go ahead and jump pass this

00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:34,980
section here and jump down to the bait

00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:36,539
section because I want to make sure that

00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:43,619
we get through everything and that we

00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:46,349
have time for questions so we're going

00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:51,140
to take all that information that static

00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:51,140
out of there and

00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:05,559
going to print out our content and then

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:10,589
also i'm not going to type this out

00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:13,299
because it's fairly thorough there is

00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:16,450
all this other information that doesn't

00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:24,789
always get filled not the highlighted

00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:27,489
region like the title prefix and that's

00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:30,640
something that's filled by modules I'm

00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:32,349
not actually sure what it's used by but

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,849
it's something that module developers

00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:39,279
can hook into and print out stuff before

00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:44,819
your title and then your tabs that's

00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:47,680
like your and it edit and view tabs and

00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:49,660
stuff like that rather than typing all

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,599
these if and end if statements I'm just

00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:56,460
going to copy this from our the one that

00:43:52,599 --> 00:44:06,519
we got out of system a system folder

00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:13,619
into our page tpo and right in there why

00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:13,619
i wrote my layout but you can see that

00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,150
we basically printed out the main

00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:23,499
content of the page I mean and what that

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:26,710
did what that was done by was just

00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:31,509
simply that right there that one line of

00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:37,390
code is what pronounce this is just a

00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:41,849
default node page that's what did all of

00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,849
that don't know why my layout broke

00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,220
I don't know why my layup broke but I'm

00:44:51,109 --> 00:45:06,280
going to go ahead and print out the

00:44:52,220 --> 00:45:06,280
sidebar normally I would wrap this in a

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,750
if an end if statement but for the sake

00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,750
of time I'm not going to

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,470
and it's not doing anything oh it's

00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:40,109
because my sidebar is empty so right now

00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:43,200
there's nothing set in my sidebar it

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:45,920
looks like unless I didn't spell the

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,920
variable right

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,850
yeah there's nothing set at my side bar

00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:02,420
so there's nothing printed out in there

00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:05,690
but normally there'd be something

00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,490
printed out to there we've got right

00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:10,100
around 10 minutes left is there any

00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:12,980
questions i don't i was hoping to get

00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,290
through all this but ran out of time but

00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,050
that's that's the basic process i would

00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:21,080
encourage you to go through when

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:28,370
starting theming is just open up one of

00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:32,750
the TPL files from wherever in Drupal

00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:35,150
core whether it's page tpo and copy it

00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:38,900
to a new and copy it into a new theme

00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:41,480
create that dot info file and get to

00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:47,240
work any questions at all anything

00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:49,360
really like not explained well or need

00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,760
to be covered a different way any

00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:59,060
general theming questions at all got

00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:05,020
plenty of time I use apps enough for

00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:05,020
everything actually yeah what do you use

00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,570
yeah I'm on a boom too so

00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:26,700
um you mean like like that like

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:32,839
automatically closes a tag if I open one

00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:37,820
yeah yeah it helps me cheat a little bit

00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:42,330
aptana apt a na it is actually an

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:44,369
eclipse plugin as well but you can

00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:46,050
download it like Artie to get it

00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:49,980
basically makes eclipse work in my

00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:53,460
opinion I think eclipse is a little

00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:57,869
buggy sometimes but I can do lots of

00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:01,940
stuff that I don't do like debug PHP

00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:04,470
programs and all sorts of crazy stuff

00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,050
but it's extremely like a good a good

00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:09,540
code editor is extremely helpful in

00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:13,550
doing any coding whether it's module

00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:17,720
development theming like it's essential

00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:20,580
he questions any more questions

00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,930
questions at all stare at the code a

00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:30,109
little bit and see if there's something

00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:30,109
you don't understand not joke yes mm-hmm

00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:53,680
that is my personal opinion but it it

00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:56,410
also depends on what you're doing with

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,620
it if the theme provides a lot of

00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:03,910
functionality like all the themes that

00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:12,280
are intended to be a base theme like

00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:14,980
fusion 960 n Omega framework I would say

00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,250
my personal opinion is because i work

00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,560
with theming is don't hack it create a

00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,760
sub-theme but if you're making a whole

00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,040
lot of changes and you're having to

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,840
you're only using a few things like I

00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,410
was talking to someone earlier today and

00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,460
they're using framework and I was like

00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:33,250
what you're not creating a sub-theme

00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,260
there but they basically are only using

00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,570
a small portion of framework for their

00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,340
daily work there they're reusing it over

00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,560
and over again and they've modified it

00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,240
at that point when you're you've

00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,840
branched off and you've just used it as

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,550
a base to do your own thing it really

00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,810
doesn't matter a whole lot because

00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,330
you're not you're not going to get that

00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:57,670
many advantages from the updates but

00:49:52,330 --> 00:50:00,160
like I did a project with the Omega

00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,740
theme which is a really cool thing that

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,350
you should check out it basically allows

00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,870
you to do dynamic layouts using a grid

00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:11,410
system all from like I think an entire

00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:15,070
site I don't think I put like a width

00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:17,890
tag I mean I put my coat adjusted the

00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,840
width on anything through CSS like I was

00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,970
able to do almost the entire layout from

00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,780
all the way from the user interface

00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:29,020
through the theme settings like in that

00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:31,780
case I would always do a base theme

00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:35,860
because i don't want stuff to be messing

00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,920
with and I know that the activity behind

00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:40,870
Omega is going to be changing a lot and

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,730
improving in the future I want to make

00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:47,590
sure that the client

00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:49,450
I can take advantage of any changes that

00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,930
are made and such but it really it

00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:55,810
really just depends but as a rule of

00:50:52,930 --> 00:51:00,190
thumb i always say trying to create a

00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:02,710
base thing and instead of hacking it but

00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:05,650
again personal opinion there's a little

00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:11,440
bit of debate about that any other

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:13,960
questions anything you really just

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,800
didn't understand want me to go over

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,260
again possibly general theme in question

00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:27,990
is all any maybe more advanced theming

00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:27,990
questions okay

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:51,510
um comes to using other people's themes

00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:53,310
if its design changes create a creative

00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:57,350
base theme I mean yeah create a

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:57,350
sub-theme of it use it as a base theme

00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:06,660
and go from there don't don't hack it if

00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:09,900
its functionality changes i would i

00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,040
would look at are these things because

00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,960
each company is going to have a

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,900
different culture and the way the teams

00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,080
set up and I mean there's so many

00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,240
different ways like you know the process

00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,460
of going from a designer's mock-ups into

00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:29,430
a drupal theme can can really vary from

00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:31,590
company to company but if it's if it's

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,990
functionality you might want to look at

00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:37,410
it and say is this going to be useful to

00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:41,190
anyone else and possibly contribute that

00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:44,340
back as a patch to the issue queue on

00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:49,710
drupal.org and if it's something like if

00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:52,350
you had to hack it then you can create

00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,060
what's called a theme setting almost

00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,950
you're familiar with those at all it's

00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,780
really just a few variables when you get

00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,910
down to it and an extra file in your

00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,590
theme folder I mean there's a whole lot

00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,240
more to it than that but it's really not

00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,970
that complex to create custom theme

00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:10,950
settings then you could create a patch

00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:12,510
that would tell the theme to use your

00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:14,700
functionality rather than the

00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,890
functionality it came with that would

00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,930
when it comes to giving back to drupal

00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:21,000
org that would be one way to approach it

00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:23,250
because sometimes project maintain errs

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,050
don't like stuff just being changed but

00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:27,270
if you want to add features to it rather

00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,860
than taking something away you could do

00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,480
it through a theme setting and

00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,010
contribute that back as a patch but it

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,960
depends on what the changes being made

00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,960
now yes

00:53:36,619 --> 00:54:18,450
okay yeah yeah that that's also really

00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,640
good I've done that that's not actually

00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:23,490
something I did early on because really

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,860
it's just it's this is just personal

00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,480
opinion it's really just not good to to

00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,240
download stuff in the hack that you've

00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:34,140
downloaded from drupal.org and that's

00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,610
just good practice in general because if

00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,490
you get the habit of that you might end

00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:41,369
up doing that on a module and the module

00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,080
may have a security hole and need a

00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:44,850
security update and then you don't

00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,190
remember what code you actually changed

00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:50,700
in it and you have to update for fear of

00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:51,780
you know some security breach and all

00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,490
your changes get blown away and you

00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,430
don't remember actually what you did so

00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:58,290
in just general copy something rather

00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,780
than I'd even heard people doing that

00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,670
with modules actually even core modules

00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,940
copying them and renaming them that that

00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:08,310
seems kind of shady to me but that if

00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,970
that's what works for you a copy rename

00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:14,910
it make the changes you need any other

00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,500
comments just general maybe a different

00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,540
perspective that maybe there's some

00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,000
different perspective I'm a femur like

00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,250
all this was from you know a front-end

00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,090
developers perspective I don't maintain

00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:30,240
that many sites so the opinions are

00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:35,160
subject to that point of view thank you

00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:38,180
very much all right I guess that's it

00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,180
thanks a lot for your time

00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:07,269
what about this I can help you like it

00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:12,390
we have the same problem or whatever on

00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:12,390
a few haters you gave me I found like

00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:17,280
let's let the word out

00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,280
you

00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:33,079
Oh s an OS that works the way that you

00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:38,269
do across all your devices HP Slate and

00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:41,180
webos HP as a service leader in cloud

00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:42,980
computing all we do is hosted computing

00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,960
to us the cloud is just the next

00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,400
generation of hosting and if someone

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,019
who's been in the hosting industry for

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,119
12 years we feel we're in a unique

00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:51,799
position to really help bring these two

00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:53,630
worlds together these different sets of

00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:55,970
technologies and to help companies

00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,819
embrace this new world in this great new

00:56:55,970 --> 00:57:00,740
tool that allows faster innovation not

00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:02,720
only is it about us being responsive and

00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,109
accountable but it's about us doing more

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,109
