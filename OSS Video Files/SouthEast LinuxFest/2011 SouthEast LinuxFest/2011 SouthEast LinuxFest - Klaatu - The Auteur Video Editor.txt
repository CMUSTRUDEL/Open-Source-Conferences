fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,180
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,060
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,300
make these videos possible right now so

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,960
hi everyone my name is Klaatu and this

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,920
talk was originally titled the auteur

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,960
video editor and the art or video editor

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,450
was a very exciting new project that I

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,030
was working on with a friend of mine and

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:53,579
it was going to be a video editor done

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,670
absolutely the correct way this is the

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,539
beginning of the tour program which was

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,840
a bunch of shell scripts by me that

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:10,590
enabled me to edit video on the command

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,119
line not a hugely popular idea not what

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,790
you would call a user friendly solution

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,280
but it was something that we started

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,700
that I started just really so that I was

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,650
able to do my job to give you a little

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,869
bit of background on my job I am a well

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,799
I was a film student and I segue from

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,450
film student to film crew member and

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,250
would work on a couple of independent

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,170
films here and there and then I got

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:44,399
hired by us film school to teach

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,780
filmmaking to students so I'm really

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,729
kind of caught up in the multimedia

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,710
content creation world and so the fact

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,530
that I happened to get into linux and

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,540
still wanted to maintain the other

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,290
passion which was multimedia content

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,630
creation kind of sent me down a search

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,799
for a really good video editor on on

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,400
linux so this was the beginning of that

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,500
and for about I'd say two months

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,380
straight we worked on our war

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,600
a lot and it was really exciting because

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,990
it was written in Python pi cute

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,420
actually so that was the the cute sort

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,910
of like KDE ish toolkit and the Python

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,670
the fancy programming language that I

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:33,030
don't understand and it was working

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,000
really well and it adhered to a lot of

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,240
the things that I knew that in order to

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,330
edit video professionally you would you

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,690
needed to have these ideas in mind one

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,610
of the ideas is for instance being able

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,130
to make sub clips out of your out of

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,630
your footage or make sequences out of

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,200
those clips and be able to play them

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,270
back and things like that so I don't

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,190
know how many of you actually have

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,160
really thought about how films are

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:08,700
edited but this is 35 millimeter film

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,489
this is what movies are made of quite

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,459
literally and it comes on these big

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,940
reels and you put it in a camera and you

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:21,810
you shoot the film and there's a

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:25,890
photochemical reaction on the celluloid

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:29,280
this stuff with light and the parts of

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,110
the little there's little silver halide

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,580
particles if you look really close you

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,440
still won't be able to see them but if

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,910
we projected it you'd actually be able

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,570
to see those little halide particles

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,120
they get transformed into into into

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,890
silver particles and they get washed

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,630
away by the developer chemicals and

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,280
stuff like that and then we develop then

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,049
you get this film back and if you look

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,810
at it through the light you can actually

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,120
see little images of people and if you

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,549
stopped by my slacker media booth you

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,340
you were able to actually look and find

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,350
out what these images were of and you

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,730
can that's how I movies are made but but

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,190
obviously we don't want to just shoot

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,510
our film all completely linear right i

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,900
mean that's not how movies are made you

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,000
you shoot one scene and then you call

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,950
cut and then you shoot a scene that

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,510
might happen in the same location but in

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,880
the story of the movie it happens like

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,500
30 days later so everyone changes their

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,790
costumes and you mess the place up and

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
make it look like it's a different day

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,450
and then they do the whole scene again

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,930
and then you go back through and start

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,750
cutting up your film

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:35,789
so cutting up film traditionally is

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:38,550
simply looking through the film strips

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:40,840
finding the frame that you like and

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,889
doing it up to the light like this is

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,960
really hard but you you can do it this

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,720
way and then they did it this way very

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,419
traditionally and then they'd cut it and

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,900
they'd say okay this this piece is kind

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,580
of trash so we'll ditch that that stuff

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,900
ends up on the cutting-room floor that

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,820
if you as you in heard that expression

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,320
that's why they call it that because

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,610
that's what they do just like that they

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,580
look at this and they say wow i'll never

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,070
use that so then they keep going through

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,130
and they say oh here's the shot that i

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,690
want to cut on and so then they cut it

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,570
again not with a knife by the way they

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,370
have fancy razors so this is now and I'm

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,580
exaggerated I'm making it shorter just

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,800
so that we can exaggerate so we don't

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,530
actually have feet and feet of film but

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,599
let's say that this is now seen seen one

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,099
this is our opening scene actually since

00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,409
we cut this first let's make this this

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:34,560
is our last scene so we put that on our

00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:37,030
little it's actually we put it in a bin

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,830
and they're big metal bins and they're

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,750
very clean they're free of dust and

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,130
they've got little hangers at the top

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,960
and you can hang them down so that they

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,270
don't hit the floor we try to keep the

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,409
film a little bit neat and so then you

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,150
look through and say oh yeah I remember

00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:51,460
that that tape that was really bad this

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,409
the actor wasn't really looking in the

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,220
right direction it was not terrible

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,330
we're not going to throw it on the

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,680
cutting room floor we're going to put it

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,419
in a different bin so we're going to

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,000
save it for later in case we absolutely

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,370
need to come back to it and then we got

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,800
another piece here this is the first

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,210
scene so then that's the last scene

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,909
that's the first scene now we need our

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,889
middle seen it wasn't it wasn't here I

00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:14,940
remember this take was really bad not

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:18,759
terrible but pretty bad this stuff was

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,130
horrible and yep this is it this is the

00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,050
take and of course in real life I would

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,000
have what's called a movie ola in front

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,919
of me and I'd be putting this film

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,349
through this little movie ola which is

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,759
basically a little well you're not gonna

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,530
be able to see it over a black terminal

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,169
I guess but it's basically a little

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,749
projector a mini projector just for the

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,939
film editor and you can kind of look at

00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:42,129
it and it sort of projects it just just

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,199
enough for me to be able to actually see

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,870
the image so this is our middle scene

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,090
and so then we've got our first scene

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,969
we've got our middle scene and we got

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,539
our last scene and now we got our movie

00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:58,629
but you know what that cut between that

00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:59,800
first and that last scene isn't exactly

00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:02,529
what I had in mind so now I'm going to

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,029
go back through and I'm going to do that

00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,219
that's my first cut now I'm going to do

00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:09,150
a little bit or a rough cut you know do

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:11,800
a little bit of trimming garbage and

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:16,150
we'll just cut will cut a little bit

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:19,509
earlier out of the the last scene and

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,310
now we've got our final cut and we would

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,680
take little pieces of tape believe it or

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,810
not and we would paste the tape we would

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,969
we would paste all these little film

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,770
strips together and then we'd send it

00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:35,259
away to the lab and they would look at

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,849
the very edge of the film and there's

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,460
little numbers on the edge of the film

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:43,569
and they'd say ok so on his on his copy

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,750
of the film he cut at frame or actually

00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:50,379
foot foot number 20 and then cut again

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,719
at foot number 30 this is 10 feet right

00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,930
here doesn't look like it so then you go

00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,930
back to the original film like a the

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,669
original film he'd make a copy of that

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,430
so this would be his nice copy of your

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,169
movie he would find 10 feet in and he

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,240
would do exactly basically make the same

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:09,249
cuts as you did and then you would run

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,050
that clean copy back through another

00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,839
printer and make another copy of that

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,710
copy so that now you've got a completely

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:21,099
non cut film just like this with all of

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:25,569
your edits in it if that makes any sense

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:28,060
and that's the copy that they consider

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:31,360
their gold master and from that they

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,190
then make more copies and send it out

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,260
all to all the movie theaters all across

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,620
the world and we go watch them in the

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:44,410
theaters and that's how filmmaking has

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:46,810
been done since literally 1890 you know

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,760
I mean it's a long time ago I don't

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,800
quote me on the date I don't know

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,820
but it's a long time it's like a hundred

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,180
years you know that they've been doing

00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,900
filmmaking that way and for some reason

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,180
at some point computers entered the

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,680
picture and they were helping us do a

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,240
lot of those middle steps where you

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,280
could cut the film but we didn't

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,510
actually have to cut it and then we

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,550
would we would just take the little

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,950
numbers off of what we just edited and

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,290
we'd go back to the film and we we do it

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,960
we'd say okay so he virtually cut from

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,820
foot 10 to 20 so I'll really cut here

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,250
and here and then and then I'll cut here

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,960
and here and make a copy of it so that's

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,940
computers started getting into it and

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,290
then later on it finally switched over

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,450
to where the computers were actually

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,300
powerful enough to do all of that stuff

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,740
so we could shoot on film and then

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,110
transfer it to digital or we could just

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,640
shoot digitally and edit it all in the

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:49,210
computer and spit it back out and

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:52,420
distribute none of the none of the none

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,940
of the video editing applications for

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,970
Linux up until actually really really

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,630
recently seemed to quite be able to

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,570
replicate that workflow because that

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,460
workflow was a very professional

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,210
workflow and there's this sort of

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:12,580
illusion in the consumer market I think

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,500
that if it's a professional way of doing

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,600
things it's too complex for the everyday

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,980
person they will never understand they

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,280
don't need to do all that they just want

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,580
something simple and enter iMovie and

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,740
other applications like that where you

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,090
don't get to look at your footage the

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,730
same way and cut it up and then

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,270
rearrange it and and to have that same

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,870
kind of workflow on your computer so I I

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:41,890
was seeking to replicate that in auteur

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:45,790
and then the main developer of tour the

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:49,840
only developer auteur got busy with his

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,390
real life work as a dentist and had to

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,060
write it was started writing himself a

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,100
dental management patient management

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,050
software called open molar which is

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,240
apparently really really good but i'm

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,130
not i'm not making

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,330
top either but I'm not a dentist so I

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,560
don't know if it's really good but I'm

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:11,500
sure it's very good but so auteur died

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,649
and someone people kept talking to me

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,149
about this this old project that I'd

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,100
known about and I'd really kind of liked

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:21,220
but could never really get to work for

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,390
me called Katie and live and some other

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,779
people were talking to me about this

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:27,339
project called open shot and I was like

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,959
yeah I don't know if they're really

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:33,070
ready because I tried them you know and

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,890
they weren't really great and finally at

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,810
the indiana linux fest about four months

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,220
ago or three months ago is the the

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,709
person who is going to give a talk

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,040
actually about katie and live called out

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:50,589
sick and they asked me to step in for

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,080
that person i was like i haven't used

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,610
katie enliven ages i can't really do

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,370
that and i didn't i did a presentation

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,230
on the way that I did my edit my editing

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:03,100
which involved a bunch of shell scripts

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,810
and blender which is great but after

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,490
that I thought well if this guy was

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,260
going to do a talk on Katie in live

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,420
there must be something to it so I

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,089
checked it out again and it turns out

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,290
that Katie and live is has come an

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:20,680
amazingly long way from where it began

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:22,209
they just released point 80.8 which

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,459
honestly I think should have been a 1

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,980
dot 0 release they've just gotten

00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,829
hosting as I understand from a blog post

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:34,120
that I read two days ago I think they

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:37,690
just got hosting on the KDE server space

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,089
so they're they're still not in family

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,990
you know you're not going to sudo

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,300
apt-get install KDE and get Katie in

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:51,190
live it's not a part of KDE but it's

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:53,800
it's it's getting there so to install

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,620
Katie in life because there are so many

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,240
different video codecs out there you

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,110
have to really kind of work at it

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760
unfortunately it's not a real

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,950
I mean I guess on some distributions

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,880
that might be a one-click install I

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,350
happen to run slackware and so I wanted

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,180
to make sure that I had all the latest

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,680
and greatest versions of the Codex

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,990
because I mean this is kind of what I do

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,000
the video editing part of things is

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,420
really kind of takes precedence over

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,250
anything else so I figured that I should

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,709
make sure that they're all up to date i

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,630
went to research what I needed turns out

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:28,370
there's a guy maintaining a list of all

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,459
the package versions that you need for

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,720
the latest version and just for a sample

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:39,019
of the stuff that we need we grab a mr

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,829
which is one of those sort of well some

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:47,899
mobile things use it a lot faad which is

00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:51,110
for AAC and decoding gsm lib DC 1394

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:56,630
which is for firewire capture live VPX

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:59,750
which is the web M stuff ork no clue

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:02,269
Schrodinger speaks x264 of course we

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:05,540
probably all know that one I mean that's

00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:08,329
your phone probably records that or your

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:13,310
camcorder probably does and then of

00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:16,699
course the ffmpeg stuff as well and then

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:21,430
you've got other I guess threatened by

00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:23,690
patent ownership codex fa AC and lame

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,370
once you've got all your codex up to

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,600
date which again on your distribution it

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:31,820
might be literally just se-young install

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,709
katie and live and it'll probably just

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,699
grab all this and update it for you but

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:41,329
for me on this box I just did it

00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:44,899
manually free or which is some digital

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,699
graphic stuff Hugh JSON which is some

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,949
kind of programmer thing that someone

00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:51,110
explained to me yesterday but I still

00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:52,699
don't understand MLT which is the back

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,550
end of kadian live that's the one that

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:57,740
makes all your media play and mix

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:02,570
instantly and stuff like this and then

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:07,899
finally Katie and live 08 the cool thing

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,899
about this is that very very recently

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:15,720
there was a really sort of big exciting

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,480
a patch to the colonel it was like

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,530
apparently 200 lines of code that they

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,050
made and it only appears in the two dot

00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,570
638 I think the dot for I I don't really

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:31,410
know but it's that one that Colonel

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,780
right there has this 200 patch 200 line

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,410
patch in it which apparently really

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,300
really removes a lot of the need to go

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,010
through your kernel and patch it for

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:46,470
real-time admiss I can't I haven't this

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,990
is still a fairly fresh box I haven't

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,360
been able to really verify that I don't

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,100
feel a need for realtime kernel stuff

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,050
yet because I haven't I don't feel like

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,970
I've pounded enough with like software

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,780
sense and real-time effects and stuff

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,180
like that but in terms of KTN live

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,290
performance it's it's really stellar on

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:10,440
this kernel so so if you want to if you

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,340
can update to that that kind of kernel

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,780
or if you just want to custom compile it

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,790
then that's kind of the kernel that

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,810
right now I'm kind of like vouching for

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm really enjoying the the two dots 638

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,880
dot for Colonel really love it just

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,240
think about it all day it's really geeky

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:35,430
to be like oh this is Colonel so cool

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:38,100
okay so so the the workflow then as we

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,440
know is we shoot and we're not going to

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,510
go over shooting film right now or

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,770
shooting video I mean I could give you a

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,340
lots of tips on that if you want to talk

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:50,820
later but lighting just lighting and

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,320
lens that's what you need so you know

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,310
you shoot and then you have to look at

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,190
your footage right you have to identify

00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,620
it and on the computer you can do that

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,550
with in katy and live or you can just do

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,570
it within your desktop i actually i

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:07,910
actually just like to do it within my

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,910
desktop i just i go find the footage

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:16,179
and I late i look at it and say okay

00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:17,769
this is ally at the KDE booth yeah I

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:22,509
remember that take that was a good take

00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:25,980
so I'll just rename that clip Klaatu at

00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:28,899
KDE and now I've got that clip labeled

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:33,130
for myself so that I actually know what

00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:35,710
it is naming conventions I like to keep

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,769
them pretty simple for instance I know

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:42,940
that all of this is at self 2011 I don't

00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:45,279
have to say it self 2011 documentary

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,600
footage you know and then Klaatu forget

00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,190
that it's quite to at KDE if it's if

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,259
it's a if it's a movie that you're

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,490
shooting or you have lots of angles of

00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:57,100
the same thing you might want to do

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,450
something like underscore long shot or

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,639
actually it would be more really of a

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,889
let's call it a medium shot and this

00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:04,570
would be take one that's the kind of

00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:06,610
convention that I typically use and I've

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,759
seen a lot of other people kind of

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,350
adhere to and I would keep i would i

00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,139
would do that throughout but we're not

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,840
going to do it right now and and besides

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:18,309
its kind of cheating katie alive because

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,870
by no means do we have to do it that way

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,990
that's just how i like to do it because

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,419
i like modularity i guess or maybe

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,600
that's just how i kind of started doing

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,340
it so so here's Katie and live this is

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,950
not the default layout when you when you

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,049
first open it up it opens some wind a

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:40,659
lot a lot more windows than I I feel you

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:42,690
really actually need but the concept

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:46,509
would be this little guy right here

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:54,070
which is now moving around is this guy

00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:56,710
right here is is my been so the bin is

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,200
where I'm keeping all of my footage that

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,759
I'm pretty sure well it's really the bin

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,759
is where I'm keeping all of my footage

00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:06,370
period but it would be after I'd kind of

00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,259
cut it into clips sort of it's not quite

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,779
analogous because we could actually cut

00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,370
it more but that's this is the place

00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:16,419
where we keep all of our raw footage and

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,820
a simple right click and adding footage

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:21,780
will

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,520
we'll put that right into your bin so it

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,770
goes into our bin and right now it's

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,140
warning me this looks bad right oh my

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,670
demo is going bad something's wrong I'm

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,010
getting an error message no it's not

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,810
actually I expected this and this is

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,120
normal and it's actually really really

00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,140
an advanced feature this this was

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,360
something that everyone got really

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,910
excited about when all the video editors

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,770
like avid and Final Cut started doing it

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,420
they were like oh my gosh you're telling

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,550
me that I'm trying to include that I'm

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,760
that I'm starting a that i'm importing a

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:54,030
clip that is 640 by 480 at 2997 frames

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,400
per second but that i had earlier in my

00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:01,530
configuration of katie and live told you

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,470
to default to a 720 x 480 frame rates I

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,700
think I probably said at the 2997 so

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,320
it's telling me that there's a disparity

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,940
between what I told it at the very

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,590
beginning when i first installed katie

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,810
and live what I was like going to

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,400
normally be working with versus what I'm

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,160
telling it that I actually want to work

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,420
with right now in this case since all of

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,740
our clips are going to be the same size

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,440
i'm going to go ahead and say yeah

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,530
switch over my my working space or my

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,200
profile as they call it to a 640 by 480

00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:31,800
space that doesn't mean i can't drag

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,480
other frame sizes in there it just means

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,730
that if I do I might have to convert it

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,220
or do some weird things or let kadian

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,150
invisibly convert it for me stuff like

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:45,360
that this right here would be our movie

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:49,140
ola the new viola was the thing where i

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,750
would be able to look at my film through

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,670
a magic little viewer see sort of you

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,460
can kind of see that you can kind of see

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,580
the the footage and the editor would

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,440
look at it and kind of see what exactly

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,060
the footage is of and if they need to

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,760
carve it down anymore so it's basically

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,670
us going like this you know looking at

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:18,150
the little tiny frames in there figuring

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:20,730
out what the footage is of so you see

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:23,130
how there's a little time there why I'm

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,220
not really speaking so we might want to

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:31,190
wait for me to find my frame and I

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:38,190
simply mark in well I mark in

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:41,100
and we figure that I'm probably talking

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,680
a lot looks like I had a little bit of a

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,260
mistake there but it's fine and we'll

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,300
cut out there let's say so I've just

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,690
marked in in and out space within a

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:56,430
larger clip so then if i drag what I've

00:21:51,690 --> 00:22:00,840
marked down here to my timeline suddenly

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:03,120
I've I simply come in and here's my

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,450
actual project don't get distracted by

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,720
the the view that's still kind of there

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,220
just extraneous Lee this is what we're

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,110
working with now this and this are

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,690
always the same the frame that's going

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,580
to show right here is where my playhead

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:21,330
is positioned in the frame in the

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,430
timeline so at the very beginning of my

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,240
movie here I've got me looking at the

00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:29,040
camera and at the very end the very end

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,650
I've got me looking down at the screen

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,650
and to view that I could

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,690
and there it is that's so that's our

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:53,690
first shot in our little project it's

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:59,240
showing me the length down here of the

00:22:53,690 --> 00:23:02,120
total project and it's showing me the

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,710
view of both the video and the audio all

00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,660
bundled up into one little

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,910
self-contained region that might work

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,910
for you it might not you can always

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:16,100
split the audio and actually you know

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,560
have your your audio down here on a

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:25,120
separate track we're still seeing it as

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:27,650
if you notice two waveforms in one

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,480
colorful box and the reason for that is

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,830
simply because it is stereo sound but

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,020
it's it's been recorded as it's not dual

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,400
mono it's a stereo track so that's why

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,400
we're seeing that if you have a fancier

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:44,050
setup you might see two two distinct

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,990
waveforms down there at the audio track

00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:50,060
so that's really the workflow of KTN to

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,540
be honest but let's let's continue just

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,990
to kind of emulate a little bit more of

00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,990
that setup

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:23,130
this all these clips by the way came

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:25,320
from the LibreOffice booth out there he

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,960
graciously donated his camera for a

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,650
little while as he was trying to get

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,630
documentary footage of people's

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:35,700
reactions to LibreOffice and stuff like

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:37,710
that let me use his camera so that I

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,310
could get some footage of the fest and

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:44,150
that was much appreciated looking for

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,150
the beginning of mine

00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:03,130
this is cut away footage of of the fest

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,130
that's not the one I'm looking for

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:38,080
48b this is it all right so another clip

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:40,210
of me so if you're let's do this so if

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,430
we're not finding the frame exactly

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:47,110
where we want to cut in obviously being

00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:49,240
too too precise in this stage is not

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,620
really it doesn't really benefit us

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,120
because we're not really sure how it's

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,860
going to look anyway once we start

00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,930
cutting it all together so we might as

00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:00,610
well get just roughly the footage that

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:03,130
we think we need we know that we want me

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,530
introducing the coffee booth so we drag

00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:08,560
that down into our timeline and then we

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:10,960
also know from this same clip I did a

00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,220
very bad cameraman thing and included my

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,990
cutaway in my in my conversation in the

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,580
clip where I'm introducing it but that's

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:21,100
okay we can deal with that we can just

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,980
mark in again from this new point and

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:27,730
get some cutaway of this person making

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,220
coffee and drag that down there and then

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:33,900
we've got that so now if we watch the

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,900
whole the whole project

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:44,080
oh wait Rachel

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:53,220
okay pretty pretty rough cut right so

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:55,500
this would be the stage of refining your

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,850
edit it's a common stage it's done all

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,260
the time ctrl shift + will zoom in to

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,350
the timeline so that you can start

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,600
getting much much more precise this

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,270
stuff right here is the symptom code

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,420
which again for for linux to be giving

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,770
me simp teatime code is a hugely

00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,110
significant achievement I've been

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,000
looking for this in blender for a long

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:22,140
time they think they actually do have it

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,260
now in 257 but it was it just it's taken

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,840
forever in I mean that's because

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,760
animators don't use timecode they use

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,620
frame numbers so it's not it's not

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,090
surprising that they didn't do that it's

00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,100
just it's nice to see it in a video

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,250
editing program that they have proper

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,690
cynthy time code so you can if you are

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,370
an editor and care about some tea time

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,100
code you can look at that you can be

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:47,280
excited about it and then you can get

00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,650
right at the frame that you think you

00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,890
want to cut and then you can do some in

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:57,060
line cutting there's of course really

00:27:52,890 --> 00:28:01,320
great keyboard shortcuts so if I hit X I

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:03,690
get this cool little little scissor icon

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,880
but if I don't know the keyboard

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:09,990
shortcut I can go up to the tool menu

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:13,230
and find my razor tool which is X and

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:19,560
then I can use the razor tool so I

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:24,060
actually move my playhead and cut the

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:26,190
footage in two parts the S key gets me

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,750
my select tool again and I can now see

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:33,000
what I've done I've I've grabbed that

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:35,340
video footage and separated it from this

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,710
bit right here now if I don't want this

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,170
piece at all I can just delete it with

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,660
the the Delete key I could have also

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,810
saved that for later or something and

00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,860
now we've got hopefully a cleaner cut

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,750
it's a cleaner cut it's a little bit

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,320
rough because there's simply no there's

00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,640
no transition there there's nothing

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,610
nothing really distracting us from the

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,650
fact that yes we are cutting away now

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:03,550
the the classic trick for that in in

00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:06,070
pretty much whether it's it's news or a

00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:08,830
movie or anything that you watch is it's

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,740
called a cutaway which means that we we

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:15,040
distract the viewer from the fact that

00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:17,620
there's a person in the frame on frame

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,180
right looking at us or looking at a

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,640
computer and then suddenly that same

00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,470
person jumps forward in time and in the

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,000
space and is now in front of a

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,830
completely different hallway talking

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,500
about coffee in the middle of the frame

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,410
very distracting to us what we can do is

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,260
hide that cut we could do a cheesy

00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,390
transition or something like that or

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,760
like I say it's a little bit more common

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,520
I think to to simply cut to something

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,240
else so here's this coffee station that

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,310
I really was impressed with so we'll do

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,950
a little bit of editing that down a

00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,650
little bit more to size and kind of drag

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:59,610
it right there onto the top layer of our

00:29:53,650 --> 00:30:02,920
video track so this just like or or

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:06,130
the layer section of ink escapes is it's

00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:10,120
a layer kind of model so whatever is on

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:12,040
the the bottom of the of the case we

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,540
will see as long as there's nothing on

00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,780
top of it and then when our playhead

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,760
hits something on top of this then will

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,920
suddenly start seeing whatever's in the

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,670
uppermost track so it's a bird's-eye

00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:27,550
view downward of the well it's actually

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,760
a side side scroller view but the top

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,800
that we have to imagine that our view

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,210
viewpoint is from here looking down

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:40,230
through that play head so if we just

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,230
back up just a little bit

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:49,240
and then we cut to coffee and you're

00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:50,559
going to hear that I was well you

00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,679
probably couldn't hear i could hear that

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,419
my voice was still was still talking

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,429
because I've got my clip under this

00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,080
coffee machine so it's just one of those

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,120
shots where you know we're looking at

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:05,529
coffee we hear the narrator speaking and

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,230
then we cut away from the coffee and

00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:12,970
there's the speaker carrying on about

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:20,980
what we what we just saw so very sort of

00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:25,539
common little trick um it actually is i

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:30,129
have not muted it i could split it away

00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:33,429
from that and then i need to ungroup the

00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:35,500
clip so basically on sorry going a

00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:37,809
little bit fast there so we've got a

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,460
clip and the way that the computers

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:40,960
representing it to us right now is it's

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,179
a colored box that contains both the

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,120
video and the audio that's a convenience

00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:48,879
thing because usually the audio and the

00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,889
video due to go together because we're

00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:52,500
filming people who are talking and those

00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:54,909
sounds need to stay together but

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,440
sometimes we don't for instance we in

00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:58,899
this case we actually want more of my

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:03,879
voice and less of that background noise

00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:06,009
of the of the coffee cutaway right so to

00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:08,289
bring it out to bring the the audio

00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:13,509
outside of this little box we simply

00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:15,940
right click and do a split split audio

00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:17,590
so that grabs the audio and takes that

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,440
out of our little color box and makes a

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,570
little colored box all of its own now

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,669
they're still joined because it's still

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,320
being assumed and this is a common

00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:28,269
assumption in any Video Editor but it's

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,519
still being assumed that well you don't

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:32,470
really want to split the audio away from

00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,909
the video you want to be able to move

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,850
them together you just don't want to

00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:38,320
have to look at them in the same box

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,970
well in this case actually that's not

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,210
true we really do want just want to get

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:46,179
rid of that so I'll clip on that click

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,850
on that and say ungroup clips now if i

00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:51,129
move the video it doesn't carry the

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,130
audio with it therefore i could take

00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:56,940
this audio i can save it for room tone

00:32:53,130 --> 00:33:01,160
or I could simply delete it and then he

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,160
goes away and then actually I do have

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:17,310
the speaker over a basically a shot that

00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:18,900
we call MOS myth out sound silence and

00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,210
there's the sound again so we'll just

00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,640
we'll keep the sound going for people so

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,490
it's not so disturbing but that's that's

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,450
how you can split the audio from the

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:38,960
video there any other questions before I

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:38,960
go on cool

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,800
july

00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:04,030
right it does and that's exactly what I

00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:06,540
was about to surprise you with but then

00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,540
you asked

00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:39,040
where is it there's a lot more effects

00:34:34,930 --> 00:35:09,430
that there used to be since I was first

00:34:39,040 --> 00:35:12,280
using it but here's what see if it I'm

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:14,320
pretty sure my um because this actually

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,090
works on my workstation at work which is

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:24,280
a lot more powerful than this computer

00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:27,220
so unless I don't have enough footage to

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:32,280
dissolve from into let's try cutting

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,280
this down a little bit yeah

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:47,050
it's probably not enough either

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,050
let's try that

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:14,470
yeah it might just not be showing this

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:16,770
to me because of this what's up is that

00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,770
right

00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:48,150
obviously I'm not much of a dissolve

00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:53,940
person so the theory here since we

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:56,309
figured it out is that you've got a film

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,430
strip being played in one area and

00:36:56,309 --> 00:37:01,559
you've got a well let's dissolve from

00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:05,029
the coffee to the person for instance

00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,029
let's take this out for now

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:22,740
alright

00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:26,220
so here's the footage of the coffee and

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,750
we'll split that so let's say that we

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,140
want to dissolve from the footage the

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:33,810
cutaway of the coffee to the person

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,910
talking about the coffee in order to do

00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,620
that back in the old days and even in

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:42,510
video since we're basically doing the

00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:45,180
same thing we would need the footage to

00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,580
literally overlap each other because if

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,260
we had it just in to end like this then

00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,150
there's nothing really to dissolve from

00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,060
or two if you dissolved out of this clip

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,920
you'd be dissolving down to nothing and

00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,720
then you'd be dissolving back into this

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,580
clip so you basically need to be

00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,280
dissolving to a blank screen which

00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,200
usually is black and then dissolving

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,400
back out of a blank screen into your

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,620
picture and that's not what you want

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,050
unless you are looking for a fade out in

00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,600
which case you can do that but but we're

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,920
not we're looking for a cross dissolve

00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,200
so unique we what we have to do

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,210
essentially is overlap the clips and

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,220
then back in the day what they would do

00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:23,340
is they would project the light through

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,980
the film strip and as they were printing

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,430
this one to the master copy they would

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,560
slowly dial down the light and suddenly

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,210
it would go to darkness and then they

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,070
would do the same thing here they back

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,050
up the film a little bit and they'd

00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,640
start the light out so that it wasn't

00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,680
shining through the strip at all and was

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,690
printing nothing and then it gradually

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:46,290
they turn up the light and it gradually

00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,730
fades into this film strip and once you

00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,630
look at the copy you've got basically

00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:53,820
one thing exposed with the light going

00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,800
away and then the other one backing up

00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,110
being exposed as the light increases and

00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:06,180
so you get a double image for a little

00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:09,090
while there so on the computer the way

00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,400
that this is done is taking advantage of

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,110
both video tracks video track one and

00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,050
two so again we're doing the whole

00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:19,440
layered view and we start out with one

00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:21,990
clip and we would really want it to go

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,760
on for actually longer than we think we

00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,370
really want it to go because we want to

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,440
be able to have some extra room that

00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:34,349
extra room there where we can

00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,910
do that fade and so it'll be footage

00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:38,880
that we kind of like half see and we

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:44,190
have done so and then we take that other

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:46,650
strip of film and move it under under

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,329
that strip so if we look at it this way

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:53,130
of course will still only see the top

00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:58,520
clip and then we it's a hard cut but if

00:39:53,130 --> 00:40:02,339
we do a add transition we can do a

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,510
dissolve transition and as you can see I

00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:06,029
mean there's a lot more than there used

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:09,329
to be back when I was first looking at

00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:11,970
this application I'm not big into

00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:14,880
transitions the effects I'm a little bit

00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:17,099
more excited about but will not go into

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,380
that yet adding transitions so we're

00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,029
doing a dissolve and there's the little

00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,059
dissolve box so it's basically saying

00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:26,010
well how much do you want me how much do

00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:28,410
you want me to start fading in and out

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:30,869
at so about midway during this dissolve

00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:33,029
we should be about fifty percent of one

00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:34,770
and fifty percent of the other which I

00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:36,990
think they're that that looks about

00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,599
right and then at the end of that

00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:42,660
dissolve by that time the top layer

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,339
should be at zero percent and the bottom

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,359
clip should be at a hundred percent and

00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,359
sure enough there you go

00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:10,099
and so there you go that's simple

00:40:56,329 --> 00:41:18,859
dissolve okay another really big deal

00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:23,060
about about making movies is that when

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:28,790
you're filming your your subjects in in

00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:30,589
in one environment you don't really have

00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:33,710
a hundred percent control of your light

00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:34,940
at all times certainly in a space like

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,920
this where there's a lot of different

00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,980
light sources and different styles of

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,359
lighting you're just kind of shooting

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,099
and you're not going to bring in a whole

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:49,940
bunch of lights and gels and stuff like

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:51,500
that to affect everything so one of the

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,990
things that you can do with it that is

00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,260
traditionally done fairly late in the

00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:01,940
Edit process actually is is actually

00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,910
color correction and I'm not seeing

00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,630
where the color correction widget went

00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,630
off to here

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,059
it's the view effect list

00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:02,549
working on a 1024 screen is a little bit

00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,349
difficult for video editing highly

00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:06,210
recommend against it if you cannot all

00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,740
help it so I'm I'm kind of clearing out

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,880
some of the space and you can actually

00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:14,430
set this up with with your own layouts

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,400
so that when you do color correction you

00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:20,099
can simply hit a keyboard combination or

00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,450
switch to a different layout and you can

00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,099
have an editing layout a color

00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:26,819
correction layout and all these other

00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:28,440
kinds of things so so this essentially

00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:31,710
this is the effect that I've just

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,289
applied to this clip there's transitions

00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:37,200
which are ways to get from one film

00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:39,990
strip to another and then there are

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,970
effects which actually look at one film

00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,410
strip and say well what do you want me

00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:45,450
to do to this film strip how do you want

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,660
me to process it what kind of effect you

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,609
want me to have over it and so on and

00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,559
there's a there's a again just a lot

00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:55,380
more than I've even been able to look at

00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,470
in the short time that I've revisited

00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,809
Katie and live especially since I'm not

00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:03,809
at the stages of doing effects yet on

00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:05,819
anything that I'm editing but there's

00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:08,700
there's just a huge amount of things and

00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:10,529
there's even stuff for broadcast video

00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,240
and stuff like that so I mean a lot of

00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:17,520
really cool stuff that you can play

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:24,500
around with definitely exciting so this

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:24,500
is not working

00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,390
that I need to get rid of

00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,660
to reset path

00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:15,370
ok

00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,010
so there are three primary channels to

00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,300
to most digital video I mean it there

00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:23,470
are actually different kinds of video

00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,990
but we'll go with that for now and it

00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:28,870
goes in complementary colors so red and

00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:34,120
blue are complementary so to add red is

00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:44,010
to subtract blue or to add green is to

00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:47,620
subtract magenta the bluer the the frame

00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:51,580
typically the the colder and and less

00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:54,340
friendly it appears the the warmer it is

00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:57,670
typically the the more that we think of

00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:01,710
it being as a very human kind of

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,710
environment something warm and inviting

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,740
and since I imagine there was a lot of

00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:15,250
fluorescence and stuff like that out

00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:17,640
there although I don't really know then

00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:21,640
you might want to sometimes add magenta

00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:25,540
to two-year to your if you shot in

00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,100
fluorescence you can go crazy with this

00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:31,090
kind of stuff and give it any kind of

00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:34,030
look that you want having a really hard

00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:36,720
time I should look at my screen not

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,720
yours I guess

00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:54,979
so let me see if I can turn this off and

00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:57,829
back on we're going to add a little bit

00:46:54,979 --> 00:47:06,140
of that might be a bit much a little bit

00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:11,719
of red and a little bit of yellow to

00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:17,959
warm the whole scene up wow that looks

00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:19,759
totally different on my screen so I'll

00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:22,180
try to correct it a little bit more for

00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:22,180
years I guess

00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:58,120
okay well let's go with that for now so

00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,070
there's the before this looks completely

00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,780
different on my but anyway there's the

00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,320
before and there's the after so you can

00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:07,360
kind of figure out what kind of overall

00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:16,750
look and feel you want out of your scene

00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:24,010
now we could take this leave it on we

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:26,230
could take these settings save it is

00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:30,220
like the color correction for this

00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:35,110
hallway and then load it back in for the

00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:36,160
coffee Kurt for the coffee scene I don't

00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,870
think it's going to work because there

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,040
are two different shots and they

00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,200
probably would actually need their own

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:46,780
their own one but let's just pretend

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:52,300
like we want to do that so now we can

00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:57,880
add an effect here color correction

00:48:52,300 --> 00:49:00,220
three point balance actually was it

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,890
three point balance or was it curves

00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,890
okay curves

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:27,510
and we can now reload from a preset if I

00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:27,510
can find it somewhere

00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:55,450
I'm not remembering how to reload from

00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,580
presets but I've done that at my work

00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,080
computer and I I guess I must have it

00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,420
configured differently or something but

00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:05,670
you can you can add you can have plenty

00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:08,470
of presets on your on your effects and

00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,660
again your layouts and then load them at

00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,250
any time you want during your project

00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,490
and it just loads all the same settings

00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:17,830
and then what I typically do is I modify

00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:21,220
it a little bit more just based on the

00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,480
individual setup you know if the

00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,670
lighting was a little bit different in

00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,190
this shot compared to the other you can

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:31,480
adjust for that so that's how I

00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:34,510
typically work it so once you've got

00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:37,960
your your your movie finished or at

00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:44,350
least a good cut of it then it's time

00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:48,490
probably to export so exporting is

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:49,960
actually really simple let's save it

00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:52,440
first just so that we don't lose

00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,440
anything

00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:07,100
and the render button right here up in

00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:10,090
the main toolbar I thought it was in the

00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:14,450
file menu as well but maybe it's not

00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:15,560
render gives you a render menu the

00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,740
render menu is really straightforward

00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,210
you're going to see more or less codecs

00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,150
along the side depending on your

00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:26,540
original setup so if you didn't

00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,610
configure certain things when you first

00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,400
installed then you're not going to see

00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:35,450
all this stuff most notably the the raw

00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,330
DV that if i'm not mistaken depends on

00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:40,160
the firewire libraries and so if you

00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,590
don't install that you can still install

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:47,090
katie in life but it might not be there

00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:48,680
because you haven't installed all the

00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:51,050
correct libraries but what you do have

00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,570
support for will be here in the left

00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:58,640
column you can choose your your your

00:51:53,570 --> 00:52:04,070
your favorite preset and then save it to

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:06,320
wherever you want to to save it to you

00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,820
can affect it here like that you can

00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,340
scale it down if you know that you're

00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,690
going to send it Yuri try to email it to

00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,690
someone you needed to be very small you

00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:17,390
can you could scale it down down in size

00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:21,910
it started out life is 640 by 480 so you

00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:24,530
could cut it in half 320 x 240 you can

00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:28,430
this is a really big feature at least

00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:30,980
for me not not so much for anyone not

00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:34,160
working with with other editors on a

00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,230
project but superimposing an overlay on

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,290
the footage is actually a really big

00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:41,960
deal it's called a burnin and when you

00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,790
send your footage to another editor if

00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,260
they're also working on your same

00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,520
project and they are your there's

00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,560
looking at your edit and they see

00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,880
something weird or they see something

00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,450
they have a question about or want to

00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,150
add to having this overlay of where of

00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,770
wherein the project you actually were is

00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:02,390
really really helpful it keeps you guys

00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:03,950
keep in sync literally so for not not

00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:05,690
the final project but for stuff that

00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,750
you're sending back and forth with other

00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:11,990
editors doing an overlay is is a huge

00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,609
huge help and then you can also do the

00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,170
you can select if you just want

00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:17,989
a little snippet like a test render you

00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:19,609
could do just the selected zone or you

00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:21,739
can do the full project and then you can

00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:23,019
render to file or again if it's

00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:25,220
something that you're going to reuse

00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:29,089
over and over you can generate the

00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:31,970
script that it would have run and then

00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:33,529
run it later on yourself I've never done

00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,569
that because I usually actually do this

00:53:33,529 --> 00:53:38,539
whole thing myself in the command line

00:53:35,569 --> 00:53:41,420
with ffmpeg so I've never actually done

00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:43,700
that yet I'm sure I will it's a seems

00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:47,089
like a really good feature and then

00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:49,039
there's lots of different ways to render

00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:52,700
it out as I've said so we'll just choose

00:53:49,039 --> 00:54:04,160
something fairly moderate and we'll call

00:53:52,700 --> 00:54:06,619
it soft 2011 and render and so this is

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,359
just kind of letting you know all your

00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:10,940
different jobs that you've got queued

00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:16,339
for your render and so that's just kind

00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:18,200
of going really nice option shut down

00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:21,289
the computer after rendering it's cool

00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:23,420
if you're rendering overnight and you go

00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:26,180
home for the day you can make sure that

00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:28,970
your computer kind of shuts itself down

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,249
gracefully after the the whole big job

00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:33,019
that you're you're processing I haven't

00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:34,339
gotten to that scale yet but it's been

00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:37,789
something that I've done in the past so

00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:39,319
I anticipate using it it's almost

00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:47,049
finished because it's only a couple of

00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:49,130
seconds that was the first pass to

00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:50,420
analyze the video and now it's doing the

00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:54,859
second pass of where it's actually

00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,759
writing out the video to file you should

00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:57,759
be able to see it in a minute

00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:23,900
any questions while we wait for this

00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:23,900
marvelous masterpiece to render yes

00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:37,360
yeah so I'm going to repeat that into

00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:39,340
the microphone basically because because

00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,270
he didn't I well I didn't bring you the

00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:46,330
mic so Paul free later Don so yeah what

00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:49,060
he is saying is that there is software

00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:51,400
now started by the genome project and

00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:54,850
being ported or maybe already poured it

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,820
over to color D to manage color profiles

00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:00,160
meaning that when I look at my screen I

00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,960
can look up at the screen and actually

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,380
make sure that we are all seeing the

00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,520
same actual color temperature I would

00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,230
have still had to come in or a little

00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,860
bit earlier and configure that on the on

00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:13,060
the on the projector and my monitor or I

00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,980
would have had to take the time to

00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,200
establish a color profile for my monitor

00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,430
but that's huge that is a huge deal

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,930
because it's been something that's been

00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:26,440
kind of a problem for a lot of Linux

00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:27,520
users in the past because on others I

00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,780
mean if you're if I'm sending it to

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,120
another editor and they say you know

00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,430
that that one scene that you made look a

00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,600
little blue that's way too blue like no

00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:38,890
it's not i'm looking at it right here

00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:41,410
how do you know so so yeah there's a

00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:43,270
color management stuff that i mean i'd

00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:46,800
actually didn't even know about so thank

00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,800
you i'll have to look into that

00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:53,279
yeah you can get those little spiders

00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,289
and stuff like that those are really

00:57:53,279 --> 00:58:00,079
nice but yeah they are a little bit

00:57:55,289 --> 00:58:00,079
expensive too yeah it makes

00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:24,180
oh my gosh there it is there's the

00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:30,630
project what screen would you base your

00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:33,750
profiles on well I mean that's that's

00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:35,310
there you're going for consistency

00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,810
you're not going for quote unquote true

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,359
color because there's no such thing as

00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:42,210
true color like we're there's no such

00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:44,880
actual thing as a true red or a true

00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:47,790
blue that's just our eyes telling us

00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,890
that's a very blue blue isn't it well

00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,960
yes you know there's no such thing so

00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:55,020
you go for consistency across all known

00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,240
monitors at the film school I work out

00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,830
we we spend days doing that to every

00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,000
single computer screen in the place so

00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:02,070
that if a student sits down at one

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,140
workstation with a document that they're

00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,580
going to print you know like a

00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,500
photograph that they're going to print

00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:19,800
it looks exactly the same on every

00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:24,650
computer so like Pantone and Kodak and

00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,650
stuff yeah

00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:35,580
yeah yeah I was yeah I don't actually do

00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,890
that though to be honest I I prefer to

00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:39,690
look at it in because the lighting

00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:42,090
environments are going to change from my

00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:44,160
computer lab to computer lab so honestly

00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,320
I like to go to the the computer lab and

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,730
say okay with in this lab they're all

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,030
going to want it to look the same I'm

00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:52,710
going to do this like by I with a couple

00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:54,030
of different photographs like it so I

00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:56,010
guess that would be what you're talking

00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:57,450
about like the known you know like we

00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:00,210
have a set of photographs that we use

00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:01,710
different skin tones different objects

01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,780
in nature stuff like that and we base it

01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:07,560
off of that it's not an exact science

01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,540
it's more like what what do we you know

01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,280
what what does it match and what do we

01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,990
want it to look like so and I think I

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:18,960
think I'm out of time are there any

01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:21,300
other quick questions i guess i don't

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,480
know i don't probable i mean you saw the

01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:26,280
list of effects so i'm going to i'm

01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,670
going to guess that it does but i have

01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:31,350
not yet I'm I'm two months into using

01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,700
this and all the projects that i'm

01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:36,540
editing right now are in the stage of

01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:40,290
the rough cut so i'm not sure but I bet

01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:43,680
that is the free or pack that you have

01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:45,780
to install is really really supposed to

01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,700
be like incredible for for all kinds of

01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,290
cool effects and that's probably where

01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:55,200
most of those effects came from I'll bet

01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:57,180
so probably but I'm not sure and that's

01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,760
it so check out slacker media info

01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:01,650
that's the documentation project that I

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,440
maintain on how to do all this kind of

01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,340
stuff on linux it's not actually

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,380
specific the slack where it's really

01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:11,250
helpful for all kinds of distributions

01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,720
to learn about multimedia on linux or at

01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,430
least what I currently at that moment

01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,520
know about want the media on linux so

01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:19,700
check that out and thanks for coming to

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,700
my talk

01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:42,660
about this I can help the like it we

01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:45,800
have the same problem or whatever other

01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,800
to do you think

01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,670
let's let the word out

01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:52,670
you

01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:07,170
as a service leader in cloud computing

01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:08,760
all we do is hosting computing to us the

01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,710
cloud is just the next generation of

01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,660
hosting and if someone who's been in the

01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:14,700
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,780
we're in a unique position to really

01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,910
help bring these two worlds together

01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:20,250
these different sets of technologies and

01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:22,560
to help companies embrace this new world

01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:24,570
in this great new tool that allows

01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,180
faster innovation not only is it about

01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:32,190
us being responsive and accountable but

01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:34,920
it's about us doing more for you whether

01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:38,940
less an OS that works the way that you

01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:43,100
do across all your devices HP Slate and

01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,100
