know you're probably a little anyone

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,569
remember that far side cartoon where the

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,509
kids raising his hand maybe excuse my

00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:49,159
brain is full that's where I kind of

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,740
feel the day so I'm hoping that I keep

00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,289
you entertained for the next hour so

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,299
talking about open source marketing now

00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,240
as Beth said I maintain a project called

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:03,310
opennms how many of you before you came

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,310
to self today had heard of opennms

00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:10,340
anyone actually using opennms ok so I

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:14,540
had like two hands so this is the part

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,849
of the show where I always lie um quite

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,739
frequently I'm invited to speak and most

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,100
shows don't want you pimping your

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,079
product and I try very very hard not to

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,420
stand up here in pimp open and a mess

00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,639
but just by being here in an open and ms

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,829
t shirt and saying hey I'm with open and

00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,209
a mess now I've taken the number of this

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:34,790
people in this room who have heard about

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,549
opennms from about five percent to one

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,590
hundred percent that's marketing and

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:42,170
that's what I'm here to talk about today

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:47,209
how does one open market an open source

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,519
project um you folks who attended mad

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,840
dogs great keynote this morning he

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,760
talked about at the very very in this

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,739
idea of you've got to market yourself I

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,959
mean opennms you may not know this is

00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,269
over ten years old we registered on

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,760
sourceforge in two thousand in March of

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,459
two thousand so we're 11 years old on

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,440
sourceforge yet only about five percent

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,000
of you at heard of us so that obviously

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,190
means that we're not doing a great job

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,660
at marketing which is one of the reasons

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:17,269
why I'm here so marketing being a geek

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,549
I've always disliked this whole idea of

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,859
marketing and the geek I hate marketing

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:24,410
isn't marketing lying that's what I

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:27,980
always thought marketing is because life

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,269
is like a beer commercial right you've

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,680
all seen beer commercials and they

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,450
always start out like

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,370
this unfortunately this doesn't show up

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,439
so well in this graphic but basically

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,060
you're at a bar and you've got your

00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,590
little hipster dude over there and he's

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,329
surrounded by all these attractive women

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,140
and you got kind of the plain looking

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:48,250
dude over here you know but then the

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,859
plane looking dude drinks a beer and

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,099
what happens this is like life right

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:58,340
suddenly he's good-looking surrounded by

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:02,620
attractive women and this gives you just

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,180
by drinking a beer suddenly you're happy

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,310
that's what marketing is right that's a

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,200
beer commercial now the truth of the

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,669
matter and being a geek I'm very much in

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,930
the truth is that if you drink a lot of

00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:17,959
beer you'll look like this so this is my

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,789
Wikipedia page I didn't create this

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,759
please God someone change the picture

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,259
but this is what beer drinkers look like

00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,229
this is the honest part about marketing

00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:31,910
now the problem is okay if I'm not if

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,070
I'm not lying if I'm not trying to

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,510
portray hey use this product suddenly

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,500
you're sexy suddenly you're surrounded

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:42,250
by attractive people what what is the

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,500
purpose of marketing why do I need it

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:49,820
well you want to tell people about your

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,440
products right so I didn't know anything

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,030
about marketing what do i do I find

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,680
someone who looks like they knew knew

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,050
what they were doing I met this young

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,509
lady at a conference she was a marketing

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,289
person and said hey let me pay you to

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:05,449
come in and look at what we do and go

00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,610
ahead and market it so people will you

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,169
know love find out about open MS they'll

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,500
love it and they'll come and they'll

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,990
give me a lotta money well unfortunately

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,460
I mean she was a great person and then

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,919
she gave us some great ideas for the

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:24,050
website but her idea of marketing was

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:26,240
this right I'm you need a Facebook page

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,650
and you need a Twitter account you need

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,630
to do all this social networking thing

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,880
because then you'll get all these people

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,830
who will come and they will spend money

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,199
and so we spent money with her we did

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,880
all these things and the number of

00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,440
qualified people showing up on my

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,130
doorstep to give me money didn't change

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,280
one bit I mean I hate to tell you this

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,290
because this is the

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,350
it's it's it's definitely below cloud

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,060
but not by much this new buzzword of you

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,800
know social networking you have to do so

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,620
and the fact that LinkedIn just had an

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,690
obscene IPO is just going to fuel the

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,100
fire so you want to see a lot of people

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,780
talking about social norms sir I'm not

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,110
trying to denigrate it it is good but

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,389
for an open source business dealing with

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,490
you know trying to limit your marketing

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:14,370
strategy to just putting tweets out is

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:16,260
not going to work the whole purpose the

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,570
whole reason is there's a thing called

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,510
the sales pipeline anyone familiar with

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:25,970
the sales pipeline it's this idea that

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,530
if you take the possible pool of clients

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,980
the ones that actually end up giving you

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,980
money is much much smaller and steady

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,930
end up with this funnel and I stole this

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,640
from the wikipedia article on this thing

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,290
so I want to give credit where credit is

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,669
due so basically if you have a new

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,020
opportunity if someone who might

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:47,430
possibly need your service or product so

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,650
you give this an opportunity you

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,360
communicate you lose some people after

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,610
the initial communication you're like hi

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm terreus I'm opening my sales and I

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,370
want to talk to you about your problem

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,760
there's a fraction of those people who

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,169
never write back but a good portion of

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,729
them do and you start talking about it

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,310
and then you find out maybe they're a

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:07,260
windows shop maybe they don't you know

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,120
have enough people and staff to match

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,000
your product you know you start doing

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,590
some fact-finding and find out what

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,590
their needs are and then you develop a

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,229
solution at each stage here's a

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,880
negotiation purchase order etc this pool

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,180
of people get smaller and smaller and

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,120
smaller so the social media aspect is

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,770
well if you want to make if you want to

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,410
make more money if you want to have more

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,840
closed accounts you just need to make

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,190
the top of the funnel bigger and that's

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,330
why the whole social network is that's

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,789
why they're like oh you just need to

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,110
tell people what's going on well we

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,190
found out that that didn't really work

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:47,970
what we wanted to do was we want to

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:52,710
match qualified customers with our

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:56,130
products now I'm kind of known for I

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,210
have this this this problem in that when

00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,930
you say you're an open source of

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,389
business

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,789
the software you produce should be open

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:05,030
source software I know that sounds

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:07,830
rather logical but there are a lot of

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,930
usually vc-backed concerns who believe

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,039
that open source software is a loss

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,960
leader that you had this little

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,789
community edition or something you put

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,710
out there to get people interested to

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:18,830
make the top of that funnel bigger but

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,120
then you actually make your money on

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,330
selling proprietary software licenses

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,550
for the enterprise version and you know

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,810
I'm not that way we're services business

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:34,349
now as a services business it's very

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:38,070
very bad if you end up selling your

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:41,610
services to someone who is not a good

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,839
match like we sell we sell support for

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,270
open MS open the Ness is one hundred

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,120
percent free we sell support for it so

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,649
if but this assumes you have a certain

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,950
amount of knowledge that you you know

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:55,050
what an Padres you know it's more of the

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,730
services we sell more break fix you

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,709
should be able to install open an MS run

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,660
it and just contact us when you have

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,580
problems we have other services such as

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,970
training and things like that if you if

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,040
you don't if I end up getting an

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,810
unqualified customer someone who doesn't

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,510
have the experience and we never start

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,660
off with an unqualified customer we have

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,400
run into a few win the person who

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,890
brought opennms into the account leaves

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,900
and the person they bring in maybe there

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,089
are windows admin maybe they just don't

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,709
have the experience and what ends up

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:27,990
happening is the number of tickets that

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,270
get open in our system increases

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,510
tremendously and it adds a lot more work

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,220
for us at some point we had one customer

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,190
that we actually wouldn't renew their

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,680
support and I'm going to tell this I'm

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,450
going to talk out of school the guy one

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,420
thing that open MS does is if there's a

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,190
problem it'll send you an email he

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,279
forwarded that email to the sports

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,920
system so when open MS said hey you've

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,820
got high cpu utilization on this device

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,820
it would open a ticket

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,330
and I'm this light and we'd have to

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,980
close it saying look you know here's the

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,960
scope of work we only answer we're not

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,740
here to solve your problems we're not

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,750
here to do your job for you and it ended

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,490
up basically I contacted his boss and

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,980
said look you're renewals up we're not

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,830
renewing what I'm gonna let you renew

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,570
because the key word here qualified

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,120
customers we have a certain business

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,640
model for us to make money we need to be

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,550
matched with qualified customers and if

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,710
I just cast my net out there and just

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,330
hope I'll catch something you know it

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,580
may not work and that's where I say all

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,430
this focus on social networks as a

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,750
marketing strategy fails you know how

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,460
many Twitter followers you know it

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,860
doesn't matter if I have 10,000 Twitter

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:44,820
followers if none of them are qualified

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:49,260
customers now I ended up having the the

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:51,630
luck to run into this woman who actually

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,520
named her name is Margaret and she had

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,790
worked with Ogilvy should actually been

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,720
a marketing person at HP this woman

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:04,800
understood marketing she didn't however

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,480
understand open and a mess she had no

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,610
idea of em issue she of course she

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,110
understood the term open source but she

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,330
was not a network management person she

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,070
was a marketing person so she sat down

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,940
with us and we start you know what do

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,410
you do well we're open andres well

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,670
what's open an S well open MS is the

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,660
world's first enterprise great network

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,830
management application management

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,430
platform developed under the open source

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,410
model here's no but what do you do we do

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,930
open it mess good know what do you do

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,810
for me you know how do you help me out I

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,670
you know she is even though she she

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,930
didn't have any computer expertise she

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:42,600
represents the the mental place where

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,370
most of our customers start out there

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,110
like you know what does open MS do for

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,120
me what we do monitor know what does it

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,190
do for me most are one of our big

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,490
customers is Papa John's Pizza they

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,280
could care less about cpu utilization

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,770
disk space utilization etc they want to

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,120
sell pizzas then you want to sell pizzas

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,470
online they want to sell pizzas

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,910
frequently when the super bowl goes

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,130
around they don't want their system to

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,650
go down because it interferes with

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,480
selling pizzas sitting here and talking

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,080
about a particular type of technology

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,480
does

00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,370
nothing for them so what other thing

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,470
Margaret said well what do you you know

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,450
what do you do not what you are because

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,380
we are this piece of software basically

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:26,280
but what we do is we help customers use

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:29,010
this software to what end and so she had

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,270
to sit down and she drew this this this

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,880
thing it'll stick with me for a while

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,750
she drew this thing on the board she

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,470
threw these squares and she said come up

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,720
with the top for strength of your

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,980
product now I'm going to put it up here

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm going to click over to the next

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,520
slide and these for these four boxes are

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,580
going to be filled in but that whole

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,900
process took us about two months I mean

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,760
it wasn't an everyday kind of thing it

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,280
was probably once or twice a week we get

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,160
together and meet for a couple hours but

00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,600
the idea was you forget about open

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,880
source forget about selling you know

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,080
look at your company look at what you do

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,650
and what are the four main things you

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,840
bring to the table and so we started

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,510
looking at open in a mess and we came up

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,220
and again I'm not I'm seriously not here

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,660
to pimp open a mess but it's the example

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,570
I have so I'm going to put it up on the

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,290
board when it came to open in a mess we

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,930
had these things and if you notice the

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:31,320
word open source doesn't really appear

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:35,360
in here because our customers the people

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,670
who actually give us money don't care

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,260
not really I mean we have I'm bigger

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,060
than fair if I say they're totally

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,650
ignorant of the fact but given the

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,450
choice between an open source tool that

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,400
doesn't work and a proprietary solution

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,960
that does they would choose the

00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,970
proprietary solution that does because

00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,110
that's what they need so when we were

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,020
talking about what open in a message

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:58,230
does we were like okay well let's focus

00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:00,390
on this it's powerful it has lots of

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,360
features and it's easy to add new

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,620
features so it's like you know it's it's

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,740
powerful has lots of features it's

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,140
flexible we can take those features and

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,670
because in a large part to its open

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,700
source of nature in another part due to

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,800
its architecture we can fit open and a

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,350
mess to various in different

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,730
environments again one of the things

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,550
that mad da was talking about the square

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,470
peg in the round hole he could

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,060
lifted part of that from my normal sales

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,700
pitch when I'm talking to someone I say

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,440
look most management tools required to

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,440
take your processes and adapt them to

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,600
the tool opennms as a network management

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,600
application platform we're flexible we

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,940
can adapt what we do to your workflows

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,649
in your processes and in the end it's

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,769
those workflows in your processes that

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:50,820
make you that make your products

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:52,829
valuable um it's scalable well I mean

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,170
this is kind of the focus of opennms we

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,579
have customers with you know 70,000

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,100
devices under management we have

00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,820
customers getting 120,000 events a

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,630
minute Papa John's has an instance of

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,550
open an MS in over 3,000 of their stores

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:11,220
these are these are big numbers and then

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,709
finally that the total cost of ownership

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,390
this is where a bit of the open source

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:17,880
stuff comes in is one of the major

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,010
pieces it's like you know hey you know

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,570
there are powerful proprietary products

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,709
out there there are flexible propriety

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,360
prior to Terry products out there

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,399
they're scalable proprietary products

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,120
out there but where we really shine is

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,399
hey total cost of ownership again a

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,060
really like Mad Dogs presentation this

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,480
morning but he was talking about how

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,070
having to pay for renewals and having to

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,779
pay for upgrades and stuff impacts jobs

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,750
and so we sat down and came up with us

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,490
so the idea is you put these four things

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,970
on and you spend a lot of time what are

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:59,220
your four main strings and then can you

00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:02,029
think of some word some phrase something

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,339
that ties all those four things together

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:08,279
I'm very fond of this this diagram and

00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,660
if my libra office skills were a little

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,279
bit better I would have it all clicky

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,980
and animated and stuff like that but

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,800
what we came up with it open and a mess

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:21,690
was the phrase get the network to work

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,449
it sounds kind of kind of logical

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,769
calling and you probably even don't even

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,480
have your brain around what that even

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:30,390
means because we didn't want it to just

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,899
be a catchphrase but we said what why

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:36,830
opennms group exists is because Papa

00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,890
John's of USA Today the gas

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,720
all of these customers went out they

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,640
didn't buy computers because they like

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,530
computers they didn't put in networks

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,650
because they're like networks they want

00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:51,440
to sell stuff they want to keep their

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:54,680
customers happy so the reason they

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,190
invested in all this technology was to

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,270
have to get a greater benefit basically

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,100
for every dollar they spend on

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,070
technology they expect to get x x

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,100
dollars out of it and without network

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:10,280
management there's no way to really

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,900
fully realize that investment so what we

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,470
do is a company is we don't do network

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,980
management we don't support opennms not

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:22,400
really what we do is we help clients get

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,839
their network to work and we liked it so

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,620
much we actually we have the trademark

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,480
on and so the reason that I have this in

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,330
the center is this kind of became as

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,140
part of our messaging when we go to

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:38,570
market we wanted to message on get

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,760
network to work and actually the RET the

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,070
trademark just came in like a month ago

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,780
so I haven't updated this but if you go

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,240
to the open MS com website right now

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,340
you'll see you know maximize your IT

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,560
potential get the network to work that's

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,680
right there on the front of the dot-com

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,180
website it's not on the dot org sign

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,130
because our org website is all about the

00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,810
product this is you know it's scalable

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,360
flexible blah blah blah but this is what

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:05,390
the product does what we do on the.com

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,200
side is focused on what we sell and it

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,530
can be one of the hardest things to

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,110
separate what your software does from

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,660
what your business does because Margaret

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,940
was sitting there asking us hey you know

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,620
I don't care what your software does you

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,730
know what does your business do what

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:29,030
what what are you selling to me as a

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,730
potential customer now when I mentioned

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,230
marketing and marketing to your

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,120
environment and how the projects are

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,890
separate again one of the things that

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,650
always irritated me about the open core

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,840
folks was that quite frequently if you

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,750
went to product name dot org they would

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,540
redirect you to product name calm /

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,670
community or something like that because

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,210
it was obvious that there the community

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,280
aspect

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,800
it was very very tired tightly to their

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,120
company and their way of making money

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,970
we've strived with open and a mess to

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,950
keep him somewhat separate and I was

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,240
trying to explain to people this and I

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,190
was having a really hard time putting

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,950
into words but after doing this for 10

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,140
years my community the people who I

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,110
consider the project community they're

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,550
not my customers the people who pop in

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,130
the IRC channel the people ask questions

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,170
on the discuss list the people who open

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,850
bugs the people who do documentation the

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,940
people who contribute to the door

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:28,550
they're not my customers my customers

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,140
usually don't have time for that or

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,520
they're coming from an HP openview

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,310
environment and they're like hey we just

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,230
need a solution that works yet most

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,490
people focus very much on all i got

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,900
these number of downloads and i have

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,090
this many people in my community so that

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,300
means that i should be worth lots of

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,370
money when in fact you know actually

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,530
working getting into your community and

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:52,570
trying to market or sell to your

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:55,280
community can be a bit counterproductive

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,650
so while I was thinking about this and

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,480
really formalized it a guy named Steven

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:02,930
Wally didn't any of you guys knew Steven

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,520
Wally is a few he's a West k he's

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,380
actually out of England now I think but

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,980
mainly west coast guy he did a lot of

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,010
work with the Microsoft's when Microsoft

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,150
open sourced a bunch of their stuff I

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:18,260
figured where they call it now codeplex

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,510
that they've renamed it though it's

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,060
something else but he was involved with

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,670
that well he did a big blog post on this

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,380
and I stole his graphs so I want to

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,310
stress that the next four slides are all

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,050
Steven lollies and he pointed out that

00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,840
in a traditional commercial software

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,000
business this is kind of what you do you

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,680
have your marketing messaging what is

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,360
your product do what advantages does it

00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,520
have you have your R&D to create a

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,340
product you put that into the customer

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,530
pipeline and you generate money from

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,090
it's very much the cathedral model and

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,610
the whole Cathedral versus the bazaar

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:56,150
you know you've got the everything is in

00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,500
one organization they develop the

00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,720
product they develop the marketing

00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,220
messages and then they present that to

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,970
the customer pipeline and hope to

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,970
generate money

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,870
now some people say who come from this

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,210
say well hey I've got this community so

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,760
I can depend on the community to give me

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,490
code and I always call this it's kind of

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,740
the Tom Sawyer effect and everyone's

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,660
read it read Tom Sawyer where he tricked

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,240
people into painting his fence and

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,650
there's so many businessmen who when

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,710
they first hear open source it's like

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:30,230
what there's people who write code for

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,150
free and give it to me this is too good

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,470
to be true and I can sell it and make

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,490
money just like a normal software

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:41,179
product and I've never seen a community

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:44,330
that actually worked for any length of

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,570
time where they ended up sending this

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,980
marketing message to the community and

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:52,130
hoping to also get this code out of the

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,110
community I was talking to one guy and

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,559
he was big open in a mess user and he

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:59,870
worked for a private equity firm in

00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,940
England and I'm like hey you seem to

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,730
like this stuff and I'm just curious why

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,820
don't you buy support and he said well

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,890
that's what they hire me for he was a

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,179
smart guy and he was you know very in

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,770
tune with linux and open source software

00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,150
in the whole bed and that was his point

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,350
it's like I'm the one who's supposed to

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,450
go out and learn how to use all these

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,860
tools they pay me money for this and

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,890
that's you know I'm supposed to fix

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,660
these problems and he was a case of the

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,510
community where you didn't you know

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,559
there was no marketing there and what

00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:33,590
Steven basically pointed out was that

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,210
there should be a different model where

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,919
the community is kind of at the heart of

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:41,720
this where what you end up doing is you

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,230
work are indeed together with your

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,440
community and we do I mean an open in a

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,450
mess most of the work done in the open s

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,630
project is done by employees of the open

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:56,299
and immense group the reason is they get

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,070
60 hours a week to work on it whereas a

00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,380
lot of our other people are part-time

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,380
but we still get significant feature

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:08,720
contribution from people who don't work

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:11,360
for me part of that is we set up the

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,700
governing body of the open and ms group

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,590
of the open MS project is called the

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,380
order of the green polo I actually

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,660
didn't wear mine this week but

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,010
many years ago I found that we had all

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,480
these people were contributing to the

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:27,820
project and they you know I didn't know

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,750
them I didn't have any connection with

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,950
him I don't know why they were

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,020
interested in open and a mess but they

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,570
were you know spending five to ten hours

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,550
a week on the list on IRC submitting

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,830
code that kind of stuff and I said I was

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,990
some way to recognize them so I took the

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,840
the British Royal Order of the Garter

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,690
and a combined it with the Masters

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,760
hunter green jacket that you win for if

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,680
you win the Augusta golf tournament and

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,020
we formed the order of the green polo

00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:58,000
and so if you if you ended up getting

00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,650
nominated to this organization then

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,300
you've got a free polo shirt you got an

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,820
open and I stored the email address you

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,730
got full repository access a little bit

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,950
and that's where about 20 people now I

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,900
think because now that we start off with

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,630
about eight and then over time we've

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,210
added two or three a year as things have

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,950
gone on and you have to get voted in by

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,470
the existing members and a lot of the

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,290
product decisions are all are made by

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,990
this group but in concert with the

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,970
dot-com side because we have you know

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,610
there are things that would probably

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,770
make the project better but I have

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:37,330
customers who actually pay me to add

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:40,080
features and I'm a pragmatic businessman

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,730
you know and and so what we focus on

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,970
what our customers pay us for first and

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,950
we rely on the community in many way in

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,540
many ways luckily most of its parallel

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,570
most of what our customers want is what

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,090
the community wants as well but we do

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,980
rely on that on RD and conversations

00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,920
about how functions should operate what

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,840
our messaging should be etc and then we

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,650
use that to actually go into the

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:10,660
customer pipeline and now steven has a

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,490
whoops so I had only that one so what we

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,390
ended up doing when we worked with

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:18,880
margaret was try to identify who we

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,050
wanted to target now a lot of people

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,990
will tell you a lot of business people

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:26,380
will talk about verticals and there's a

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,480
lot of strength in that the idea is ok

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,370
if you have a tool that's useful in many

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,930
ways but maybe it's really useful

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,480
in a medical setup then maybe you'd want

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:40,480
to focus on you know that as your

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,280
vertical at open MS we've tried to be

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,430
very very broad but we had to have some

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,680
way to qualify customers and open a mess

00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,660
isn't is a platform and it really

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,480
requires at least one person dedicated

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,250
to this so if someone calls me up and

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,500
they say hey yeah we're a three person I

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,000
tea shop we spend ninety nine percent of

00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,059
our time doing windows desktop

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,460
maintenance you know we tell us about

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,429
opennms basically say go buy solar wings

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,900
I mean I know its proprietary but it's

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,790
pointy cliquey and it's pretty and it's

00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,340
relatively inexpensive and it runs on

00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:15,070
Windows just perfectly and you guys like

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,230
it most of the customers who pay us the

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,270
most money they have not only to have a

00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,640
a person they have an entire department

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,770
that all they do is focus on the health

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,630
of the network and those are the people

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,860
we target and by being able to and we

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,330
didn't know that because I mean when you

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,760
start out the idea is I want to sell to

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,440
anybody but the problem is you have

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
limited amount of time and you really

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,130
don't want to spend a lot of your

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,010
limited time focusing on people who

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,960
aren't a good match you want to focus on

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:44,740
the smaller pool of people that have a

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,940
much greater chance and you can't really

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,650
do that when you're out there just

00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,809
tweeting away and you can't do that with

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:53,080
Facebook and you can't do that just

00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:56,320
trying to talk to everybody so another

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,890
thing Margaret gave us was um Martin

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:04,270
came to us and said one of the things

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:07,120
that really sells is customer stories so

00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:08,950
it's very difficult especially with a

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,890
lot of our customers to actually get

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,360
them to let us use their name you know

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,490
and actually say they use this product

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,559
some people are so security sensitive

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,870
they don't want anyone to know what

00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,230
products they use because hey if there

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,730
is a security breach and they know and

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,170
someone says oh I'm going to do a Google

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,970
as oh this is using this product i'm

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,700
going to try and get into this you know

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:33,040
site so i can understand it but we did

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,500
on our website we actually focus front

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,630
and center we have pictures of several

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,610
of our clients and the idea is that

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,070
we've got a the city of Grapevine Texas

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,120
they use opennms to monitor traffic

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,309
lights

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,450
and this sounds kind of silly why you

00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,730
know why would you want to monitor

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,680
traffic lights well grapevine texas is

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,210
right outside of Dallas Fort Worth it's

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,610
where the stadium for the Super Bowl is

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,930
and if you guys will remember this year

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,300
just before the Super Bowl they had a

00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,730
huge snowstorm so while everyone was

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,650
flying in to watch the Super Bowl the

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,970
streets were backed up the airport was

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,850
backed up there was a foot of snow on

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,860
the ground in Texas well they were able

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,390
to adjust the light timing and find out

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,610
everything was that was going right and

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,050
going wrong on their streets by

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,580
integrating open and a mess with their

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:19,120
street lights so maybe this will help

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,040
other so the idea is rather than have a

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,559
tweet if someone comes to our website

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,500
and says hey let's read about city of

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,179
Grapevine because i'm the city of

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,429
spartanburg maybe I'll find something I

00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,380
like there we've got good old papa

00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:34,300
john's pizza so if you're in a large

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,600
retail kind of environment maybe that'll

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,070
appeal to you tina niblet is it works

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,440
for new age networks it's now part of

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,730
earthlink so if you're a big isp maybe

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,870
that appeals to you and finally we've

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:49,660
got Andrews borns Jordison this is some

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:54,460
work we did pro bono during the haiti

00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:57,130
earthquake we help these guys in video

00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,540
which is one of Mad Dogs when I first

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,070
started talking to Mad Dog it was

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,679
because he really likes his charity in

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,410
vinnio deploys wireless networks in

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:07,660
disaster areas and they use open and a

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,720
mess to manage it and so there's a

00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,370
picture of Andres putting up an antenna

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,800
up on the the roof in port-au-prince

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:22,270
Haiti so so the final thoughts and and I

00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,800
kind of buzz through these slides when

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,630
it comes to marketing it's like other

00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,280
businesses I mean there's nothing

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,710
special about open source in the sense

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,390
that you want to increase your number of

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,650
the reason you use marketing is to

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,679
increase the number of potential

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,570
customers as I said when I came here you

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,400
guys haven't heard of openness now in

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,050
hearing me talk I don't know if that

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,300
makes you a potential customer or not

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,010
but at least you know as far as that

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,240
sales funnel goes the top has gotten a

00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,440
lot bigger and even if you don't use it

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,850
maybe you'll sit down and talk to

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,370
someone else and they say hey I'm

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,720
looking at me I need to put a monitoring

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,539
solution we've outgrown oggi

00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,380
let me check out open in ms word of

00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:04,809
mouth is very very strong define what

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,210
you do not what you are don't focus on

00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:09,909
well I'm a web server or I'm a database

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,909
server or I'm a network management tool

00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:14,620
what do you do well we provide value we

00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:18,010
provide consultant we provide solutions

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,960
we get the network to work those kind of

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:24,610
things those resonate more with

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:28,150
customers than a list of features your

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:31,059
community is not your customer any time

00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:34,179
you turn around and take even in open

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:36,070
and a mess there's bound to be a bit of

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,340
you know why are you doing this for free

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:40,539
why are you spending all this money and

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,830
creating the software and then giving it

00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:47,470
away I one of the things that struck me

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,990
was I was doing some work in Australia

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:53,799
and I was walking from the it was

00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,900
actually the tax department of New South

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,120
Wales so here was the you know that you

00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,159
have a small list or call her evil

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,630
customers and they're not evil in the

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,710
sense that they know they have horns and

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,179
stuff like that but it says you know

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,460
they're in businesses that most people

00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:08,860
you know like tax collecting when one

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,110
company contact us they did traffic

00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,760
cameras they wanted to manage the

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,590
traffic camera so they had they got a

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,600
new ad since they're no longer here i

00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,490
can mention them remember never add they

00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,400
were doing deep packet inspection and

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,440
then inserting ads into like your HTML

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,330
stream so if you're like you're surfing

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,919
to your private website they could

00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,320
actually have it so that there was a

00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,530
banner ad added to the HTML coming from

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,120
your server added by the ISP you know

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,220
that kind of falls under the evil but

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,049
they pay their bills and they used open

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,150
and a mess the vontage stuff so I'm

00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,980
walking from the tax department back to

00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,530
my hotel room and I'm going on the

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,730
street and this woman in a kimono jumps

00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,360
out of this restaurant of the plate of

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,799
food it's an eat this I mean it was a

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,380
little nicer than that but that anything

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,590
about a stranger hops out and hinge your

00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,850
plate of food eat this so two things

00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,590
went through my mind immediately the

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,450
first one was it whoa is it safe what's

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:04,210
going on here what's what's going on you

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,630
know is it safe and then the second

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,010
thing was okay what's the angle if

00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,600
someone is coming to you

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,510
and offering you something that usually

00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,980
costs money for free what's the angle

00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,600
and you look at the Chinese restaurant

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,950
you see the attractive woman in the

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,870
kimono with the egg rolls and you're

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,930
like okay I the egg roll it's about

00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:27,700
suppertime a little hungry maybe I'll go

00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:29,350
in and I'll buy a meal here and I

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,730
started looking at that's kind of like

00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:35,530
open source for a lot of like CEOs it's

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,220
like sometimes some of that here use

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:40,720
this what is it it's free software so

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,550
first of all they go is this safe you

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,350
know I click down and it says you know

00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,450
add this free software on their time and

00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,790
it's viruses and trojans and stuff so I

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,160
don't want that so is it safe and then

00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,990
the second thing is what's the catch why

00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,480
would anyone offer me free software and

00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,670
I think that's why for a while this open

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,350
core model was very very popular because

00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,390
when they mentioned well here's free

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,700
software oh but if you want those

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,510
features you gotta pay it's like the CEO

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,320
would not do oh I figured you help you

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,940
know you're just like regular

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,100
proprietary software companies but I

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,540
understand now so they were comfortable

00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,410
making the buying decision when you walk

00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,520
up to someone and say hey you know

00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,500
here's some free software you use it

00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,970
there's a trust issue and it's one of

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,400
the things I think we have to overcome

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:25,990
and perhaps marketing will do that being

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,170
able to show your other customers and

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,910
say hey they trust us and when you start

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,370
out you may only have one customer but

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:38,310
if the customers willing you know you

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:41,350
got to start somewhere now be truthful I

00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,730
mean again I didn't get a big of a laugh

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,500
on the beer thing as I thought I think

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,560
the pictures are much better if you look

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,390
at them on my laptop but a friend of

00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,920
mine help me set this up but you know

00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,950
cuz beer commercials no I mean you get a

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,530
big gigawatt you know but the the title

00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:00,100
of my talk actually tastes great or less

00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:03,960
filling that a lot of work went into

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:06,460
that phrase because beer manufacturers

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,820
they don't target the casual drinker

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,960
they target what are called k sirs and

00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,639
these are people who go to the grocery

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,860
store and they come out with a case of

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,580
beer under each arm and you know one on

00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,060
there on there

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,190
head and you know they already know beer

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:26,440
tastes great but it's like less filling

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:28,120
I can drink more beer and therefore the

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,130
company can sell more beer they can make

00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,080
more money etc there was actually a lot

00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,580
of stuff went in that hole am i old

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,490
enough does everyone remember the ads

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:39,250
with tastes great it's great okay just

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:42,040
not dating myself here but be truthful I

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,130
mean that will sell again most open

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,990
source businesses or services focused on

00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:49,360
you want to find those customers who

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,880
were good i was telling Jeff this

00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,860
morning on the way down here I get an

00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,510
email and I read it it's from a guy that

00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,580
we've done business with the past called

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,340
Shane well Shane he worked for an

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,230
investment firm in California he left he

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,150
kind of disappeared we kept up you know

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,560
through LinkedIn for a while he's now in

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,420
New York and he said hey I'm at this new

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,700
place we need to open an MS Support send

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:14,110
me an invoice easiest cells process ever

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,790
not send me a quote so I'm getting to

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:19,510
approve I send me an invoice and I'll

00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:21,160
get it paid and that came from the fact

00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,110
that you know we had built this

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,590
reputation up he dug done business with

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:29,680
us before etc but i would take one of

00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:33,310
him over trying to get 20 people who

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,410
were bad fits to work so focus on your

00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,110
marketing message to target exactly

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,640
those people and you may have to figure

00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,500
that we had to figure it out I mean we

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,020
went through this process what a year

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,550
ago I mean it isn't something we've done

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,350
recently it was something we sat down

00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,680
with and said hey it's time we've got to

00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:53,710
do this and it is starting to pay off

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:59,140
but I think that's it but I'm more than

00:35:53,710 --> 00:36:03,840
happy to take questions not about that

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,840
nasty wikipedia picture but yes sir

00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:17,060
okay the question was do we actually

00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:21,140
have salespeople who are actively doing

00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:23,840
sales the answer question is no last

00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:27,850
year well at the end of 2009 beginning

00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:31,630
of 2010 we went from five people to ten

00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:34,100
unfortunately my revenues didn't double

00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:37,790
but part of that was we hired a sales

00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:40,790
guy and we hired a marketing guy they're

00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:42,020
both people have known the we had every

00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,920
confidence that this was going to work

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,170
out and it just didn't what we found is

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,610
that at least in selling services and

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,260
selling open and ms services it takes a

00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:58,400
very certain type of individual and a

00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:01,370
traditional salesperson just doesn't in

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,940
someone who's used to pushing a product

00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:07,040
doesn't work very well I consider myself

00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,930
pretty good if you can get me in front

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,360
of the customer I'm very very good at

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,980
convincing them whether or not open the

00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,680
nest is a good fit if it's a good fit I

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:18,050
can usually win the deal I can't close

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,730
the door much less a sale but I can get

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:24,170
to the point where the customer can make

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:26,380
up their mind we do use Salesforce the

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,580
open anyone here we'd open source com

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,410
there's a website so there's open source

00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,960
story which is the OSI foundation's

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:35,390
website well Rackspace for many many

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,700
years owned the open source com domain

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,990
and I think it either redirected the red

00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,940
hat or they didn't really do anything

00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,250
with the domain but about two years ago

00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,620
I think was two years ago they came out

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:49,250
with a website called opening open and

00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,650
open source com and I write a roughly

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,120
monthly column on this and my neck one

00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,850
of the columns coming up is going to be

00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,330
on tools and we looked at Sugar CRM and

00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,820
stuff like that but we do use Salesforce

00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:03,680
because we home trickles most of our

00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,140
sales actually come people right sales

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,180
that opennms calm and there will be you

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,790
know anywhere from hey I tried to

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,040
install it and I'm getting this error 22

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,390
hey we want to migrate off HP openview

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,280
or my from usenet cool we really like

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,920
your stuff talk to us let's do a demo

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,510
etc like that so the vast majority of

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,640
our leads are just we call it trickles

00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,080
and a lot of those trickles come because

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,039
of this activity that the community

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,959
generates

00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,809
which is one of those things that it

00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:32,209
really ties together is that you know

00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,919
seeing the fact that we have 50 60 email

00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:36,650
messages a day go through the mailing

00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:38,539
list really gets people excited about

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:43,069
the fact that hey this projects

00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:45,199
obviously busy but no we haven't done a

00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:48,709
dedicated sales force yet we do have a

00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,929
form on the website that you fill in it

00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:54,199
opens a Salesforce lead and we manage it

00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:55,609
that way but right at the moment we to

00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,439
be perfectly honest we have more sales

00:38:55,609 --> 00:39:00,079
than we can more sales opportunities

00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:03,140
than we can deal with and still it's

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,630
sometimes hard to walk away one of the

00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,640
things I didn't open source com was I

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:11,809
was talking about I had this personal

00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:15,439
hatred for rfps does anyone have to deal

00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:18,229
with the RFP process don't wait I mean

00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:22,160
we I'm sorry I'm going off script here

00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:24,679
but so this can't see if i can get to my

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,809
email while I was sitting here this out

00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:32,239
of my spam folder here we go for nms

00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:34,789
blah blah blah blah blah gujrat and mutt

00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,589
ha pradesh we are working on blah blah

00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:40,099
blah tender floated by these companies

00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:41,779
and we need this list of stuff so

00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:45,829
basically what's happened is there's a

00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:47,989
company in india that as put out a

00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:50,749
tender saying hey we need this solution

00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:52,729
this company has this niche and they

00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:54,709
want us to do a lot of work and

00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:57,049
basically so the best we can kind of

00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:59,239
hope for is to be a second you know

00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:01,130
subcontractors the guy who wins this job

00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,140
and trust me if you've ever been in that

00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,699
situation anything that goes wrong with

00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,279
the project is going to be blamed on you

00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:09,709
and if you hope to get paid your

00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:11,719
contractor is going to basically require

00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:12,919
that you do a lot of extra work that

00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:18,019
they probably should have covered in the

00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:20,150
first place the only I can't think of an

00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:22,069
RFP process that we actually went

00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:25,069
through that that that netted us any

00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:26,630
money so when it comes to sales process

00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:30,079
because it's open source and I say look

00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:34,999
it's open source download it try it out

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,890
we charge people for demos not the usual

00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,500
you know give me an hour WebEx and just

00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,210
kind of

00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,840
talk to me that's that's pretty sales

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,250
but comma AO does anyone the traditional

00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,870
proprietary software thing they do this

00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,020
thing called a pop a proof of concept

00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,790
and so you would fly in it the you had

00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,960
these sales engineers would fly to the

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,670
place they'd spent three or four days

00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,380
they'd install the software they get it

00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,630
to work of course it all had license

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,720
keys that expired in like 30 days and

00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,340
the idea was that if in 30 days they

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,680
either bought the software or stopped

00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,330
working and you moved on and you could

00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,500
keep a guy on the road either two or

00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,780
three times let's say that b8

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,250
opportunities a month and if you landed

00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,770
one it would pay for itself and the

00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,180
license fees you can't do that with open

00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,950
source because if I show up on your site

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,690
and I install it and i get it working

00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,710
and show you how to use it and i leave

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:24,960
and you don't pay me anything well how

00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,700
do i make money you know the solutions

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,620
there i don't have any blackmail of

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,270
license key used to do it so we have a

00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,250
project called getting to know you and

00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,680
it's two days cost four grand plus

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,480
expenses will come out and do this if

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,250
you buy a bigger project later we'll

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,190
give you some credit toward that I mean

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,990
we work on but it's basically you pay

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,090
for our time that's part of our product

00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,470
we get the network to work we don't sell

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,810
you we're not selling software I'm in

00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,550
selling you a piece of an application

00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm selling your solution and so you

00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:56,280
need to pay me actually the column i

00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,510
wrote for for open source com that

00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,640
should come out in the week or so it's

00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,980
called payday and it's all about getting

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,270
paid and that you should expect to get

00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,130
paid but as far as the sales process

00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:09,420
goes we do a lot of we end up getting

00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,460
almost all of our stuff through trickles

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,410
if you type open source network

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,450
management into google we are the number

00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:18,330
one hit we haven't done anything really

00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,860
we haven't tricked google into doing

00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:21,480
that if you type of resource network

00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,580
monitoring we're on the front page but

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,470
open source network management we're on

00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,090
the first hit and i guess people find us

00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:30,450
that way and they find us word of mouth

00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:32,730
coming to conferences like this i mean i

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,470
want to stress you know i love the fact

00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,300
that one of the things they did in self

00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,930
this year if you came last year they had

00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,720
like eight tracks and there were so many

00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,920
good speakers that it's you know half

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,070
the people that are in this room today

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,980
were in my talk last year it was just it

00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,820
was very very hard to focus on what's

00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,880
going and I

00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,830
what self and olf and texas linux fest

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,320
and scale in all these conferences I

00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:01,500
want them to have the pic speakers and

00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:06,060
so get out put out to it takes maybe 10

00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:07,620
minutes to to do a paper submission what

00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,960
I do is I usually pick two or three

00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,400
topics of the scale is in February so

00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,710
it's like at the beginning of the

00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,250
conference year whereas olf and a few

00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,110
these others are around

00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,820
september-october it's kind of end and

00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,650
so I come up with some tapered paper

00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,210
topics and I just submit them to all the

00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,640
different conferences and i hope i get

00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,080
accepted and then if i do i can stand up

00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,030
here i get to meet cool people i get to

00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,920
talk to people in the hallways they see

00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:31,770
my open and a mesh shirt it's not just a

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,630
job it's a wardrobe lands end I met the

00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,580
guy from sqlite and he had the same

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:39,120
exact lands in shirt cost a hundred

00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,700
bucks to get your logo set up and and

00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,110
that's that's part of the marketing and

00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,700
then when then suddenly I'll get an

00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,800
email i get i pass out some business

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,930

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,210
II nima um one of my customers is

00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:54,270
Northern Trust it's a it's a fancy Bank

00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,920
in Chicago and the relationship I have

00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,750
with with the guy there he's one of my

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,710
one of my better friends actually and we

00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:04,140
met at linux world expo new york in 2002

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,090
as we were trying to get our max to talk

00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,800
to the Wi-Fi because we both had max at

00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:09,630
the time and that's where we met six

00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,420
months later I get a phone call you know

00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:14,190
hey we need a new management solution

00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,720
can you help us out and they've been a

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:21,480
customer since 2004 and so I'm like you

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,440
know the best marketing you can do is

00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:28,220
yourself any other questions I'm I don't

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,220
want to yes sir

00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:38,800
um part of its kind of tricky like um we

00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,390
actually updated our contracts for

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,940
support and we actually have a clause in

00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:45,970
there now that you know we do have the

00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,700
right to do this but the process is the

00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,130
kind of hipster looking guy with all the

00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,540
women in the first slide as name's Phil

00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,370
and he's a friend of mine and he does

00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:57,640
marketing for us and so what we do is

00:44:54,370 --> 00:45:00,130
like we just we just finished a project

00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,870
at the gap and so what I'll do is next

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,280
week I'll have Phil contact the people

00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,900
at the gap and say how was the

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,550
presentation hey I'm a neutral party

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,890
because he doesn't work he's not an

00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:11,200
employee will get on his feedback and if

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,250
they're willing he'll ask him a bunch of

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,410
questions and we'll put together a

00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,540
testimonial and we put them up on the

00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,580
website I actually have a couple of

00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:20,410
testimonials that were just literally

00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,660
waiting on approval because the process

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,910
is he does the interview he writes it up

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,800
we edit it we send it back to the

00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,840
customer and get them approved but that

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,550
we have one customer in a private equity

00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,740
firm in New York that we're not even

00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:35,710
allowed to use than we're not even I

00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,740
can't tell you they exist it's like the

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:42,040
name of the company which is top secret

00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:43,420
it has two letters in the initials two

00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,160
letters I'm giving a lot of way there he

00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,260
says the name only appears on the check

00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,580
they're not on the door you know private

00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,350
equity firms are there there were a

00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,050
bunch of rich guys hire a bunch of smart

00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,220
guys to make them richer guys and if

00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,770
you've ever gone they usually have

00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:59,110
really dingy office space with top-notch

00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,970
gear you're walking there'll be six

00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:03,280
seven monitors and all this other stuff

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,620
because they basically write computer

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,000
programs to take advantages and

00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,690
discrepancies in the market make money

00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,710
and so they really love open source

00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,570
software because they don't want to let

00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,250
an HP into their environment they don't

00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,230
want to I remember I was at one firm in

00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,500
Chicago we have a number of these firms

00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,120
one firm in Chicago and I was showing

00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,680
them how you can send events the open an

00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,960
MS just by connecting to a port and

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,390
spilling some XML and in 20 minutes he

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,370
had he had modified his app to start

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:34,120
sending custom events and open and a

00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,530
mess and he loved it but we weren't even

00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,870
you know it's one of those customers I

00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,910
can't tell they exist so yeah it's hard

00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,980
I mean we've got great customers but

00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,570
getting them and sitting in an

00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,840
environment like this in saying that you

00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,460
know you

00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,830
USA Today is a customer that's not a

00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,470
problem getting USA Today tool and he

00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:53,920
put their logo on my website totally

00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:57,630
different matter and so again you just

00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,280
keep keep asked nicely be kind of

00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,990
persistent and sooner or later you may

00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,390
actually get them I mean I have to cut

00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:07,540
to proposal to stories that I want to

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,800
put up pretty soon and we're just

00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,300
waiting on pictures because we have a

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,980
certain there's a little if you ever go

00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,990
to open MS com is little rotating

00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,730
picture that goes but it's very

00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,440
important because when you're talking to

00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,810
a bank or you talk to a hospital or

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,400
you're talking to a university they

00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:23,500
really really want to know that there

00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,500
are other people out there using their

00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,760
stuff and it's because how do you do who

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,410
are we talking to we were talking a

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,040
little bit in the hallway and it was

00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:34,630
like if you wanna if you wanna maybe

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,550
there's a there's an issue coming up on

00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,990
the ballot and you're not really aware

00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,910
of how you should vote what do you do

00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,560
you talk to your friends and you may

00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,730
actually have friends are very informed

00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,230
about such things well how should I vote

00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,970
well I've examined the issues and I

00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,040
think we should vote nut or yes we

00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,110
should vote yes and sometimes I'll just

00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,730
vote like they vote and so a lot of

00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,440
people like to do what they do and is

00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:56,020
mad dog was saying this morning volume

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,700
volume volume trying to get get your

00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,680
word out get as many customers as you

00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:04,960
can but you'd want qualified customers

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,520
so is wicked having you got all these

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,970
great customers and knowing then no one

00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,970
lets you talk about

00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,960
right so that so yeah and the whole idea

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,430
is ok suppose there's a problem with

00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,109
wicked or there's a problem with open a

00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,990
mess and I did this I actually found the

00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:34,450
bug in in my chrome use many many years

00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,070
ago and it turned out that playboy was a

00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:37,900
customer of my chrome use and so I was

00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:40,390
all over the playboy site trying to find

00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,310
that open port to see if I could exploit

00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,260
the website of course their management

00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,940
machine wasn't tied to their website in

00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,560
such a way that I could do that but I

00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,930
didn't it didn't stop me from looking so

00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:53,770
it's a valid concern but if someone

00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:55,390
who's starting out and struggling you

00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,340
know it can be frustrating because you

00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,950
end up seeing you know customers that

00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,210
have a lot more money than you and

00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,970
they're there they're going out because

00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,650
people just don't know you exist and I

00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,930
don't know I I don't have all the

00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,160
answers because I mean we were

00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,520
registered on source words in two

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,690
thousand or 11 years old and only five

00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,490
percent of people in this room and heard

00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:19,780
of us but you have now so again one of

00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,000
the great things about coming to self

00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,680
and coming to these conferences is it

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,220
does allow you to meet great people

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:33,420
first of all and then second of all

00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:33,420
raise the awareness anyone else sir

00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:46,160
well it doesn't come it they don't come

00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:49,339
at the expense of the community but what

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,010
we work on so it's a good question i

00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:53,900
mean the question is how do you balance

00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,910
community and the commercial side of any

00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:59,210
open source project well one of the ways

00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,710
we do it is every bit of code we write

00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,990
is available under an open source

00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:05,119
license so we don't have that tension

00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:09,799
because I say I remember there was one

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:12,349
one we called fopen source fau XP and

00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:14,299
open source one of our in our in our

00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:17,869
space was talking it's like yeah well

00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:18,710
guy was very happy because one question

00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:21,710
I always said they had a plug-in

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:24,380
architecture and someone wrote a plug-in

00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:28,490
that duplicated something they charge

00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:32,000
for you know so there's attention if you

00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:34,789
if between the community and the company

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,190
it's like well crap I go to if I'm a

00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:38,660
standard VC back model I have these I

00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,910
went in front of these people and said

00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,200
here's some hockey stick graph you know

00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,339
you give me money and we'll start off

00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,510
like this and then we'll spend your

00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:46,430
money and then we'll do like this then

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:49,190
well make money and part of its going to

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,990
be i'm going to license this feature so

00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,220
you do your little open source with your

00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,900
fokin source thing and then suddenly

00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,819
some guy in the community says how i

00:50:53,900 --> 00:51:00,710
wrote that feature here i'll commit it

00:50:55,819 --> 00:51:03,650
do you accept it you know let's say and

00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:06,740
then the philosophical things what if

00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:09,920
it's crap but it kind of works do you

00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:11,270
accept it I mean because if you refuse

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,770
it then it could be saying that you're

00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:15,349
refusing it because you don't want to

00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,569
compete with your proprietary version

00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:20,029
but to me open source is all about not

00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:21,950
reinventing the wheel and hear you had

00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:24,440
some guy had to spend a lot of effort to

00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:26,869
duplicate what you'd already done and to

00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,240
me that's a broken model I mean I'm none

00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:34,309
of us upset over having some open aspect

00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,569
of your product to to gain users I'm not

00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:37,880
against that at all just don't call it

00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:41,809
open source so what we've done is the

00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,849
first rule was every bit of code calm

00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:45,920
writes is available to work we don't

00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:48,440
it's the same repository we don't hide

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,410
anything so we don't have any features

00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,290
that are hidden the second thing is

00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,350
decision

00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:57,990
such as licensing I was another decision

00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:01,140
we recently did it turns out that next

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:02,880
week not starting next sunday is our

00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,100
annual developers conference called Def

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,240
Jam's up in Minnesota and we have 18

00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:13,260
guys from five countries Germany France

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:16,380
New Zealand England u.s. and Venezuela

00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,640
so six countries so we've got got 18

00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,250
guys from six countries and we'll spend

00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,950
the entire week from Sunday to Saturday

00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:24,930
working on non-code and these people

00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:27,450
help do make decisions about things like

00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,940
licensing and how we what we want to

00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:32,490
focus on as a community but it's a

00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,070
meritocracy and so the people who do the

00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,570
most work get the most say and we end up

00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:39,240
having a lot of say because we do a lot

00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:41,340
of the work now I've hired most of the

00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,930
people out of the community it's great

00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:45,720
being an employer I have a list as soon

00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:47,340
as the finances allow for it I've got

00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,380
three guys that I want to hire boom boom

00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:52,020
boom boom boom as soon as because we're

00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,630
bootstrapped we don't have any bc and so

00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,010
i have to hiring decisions or a bit

00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,600
painful because we've got to make sure

00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,580
we have enough in the bank and enough in

00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,990
savings to make sure that we can hire

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,080
this guy but as soon as we do we hire

00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:06,780
you need in the negative work but we've

00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,460
never had luckily a been at loggerheads

00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,350
wear something we wanted to do was

00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:15,300
against what the community wanted us to

00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:17,190
do although here's an example like every

00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,650
year at Def Jam they want us to work on

00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:21,090
the web UI for for open animation if you

00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,220
ever seen our web UI it's very simple

00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:25,230
and it was designed that way because you

00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,850
can use it on phone you know you can use

00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,310
it anywhere it's not supposed to be all

00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,960
fancy because you're busy people you're

00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:33,210
supposed to be off doing busy things and

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,440
not staring at a screen and then you get

00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,030
an alert and then you go look at the

00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,700
screen and its design some people like

00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:40,290
it a lot of people don't my biggest

00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:44,280
customers like new edge in rackspace

00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:46,410
they don't even use the web UI they mind

00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,970
the data that opennms generates either

00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:51,540
directly through the database or through

00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,890
xml-rpc or through rest and they present

00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,960
that data that their customers directly

00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,790
through their own portals so here's

00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,830
here's a question so again we're getting

00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,180
ready for Def Jam and the guy so we need

00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,150
to work on the web you on I'm like no

00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,860
I'm not going to my view hot because it

00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,850
doesn't Bennett you know because we hear

00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,470
this a lot I'm like

00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,970
if someone wants to step up and own that

00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:10,500
project I will support you when I

00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,020
represent i will give you sir i'll give

00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,460
you whatever you need but you know from

00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,680
the business standpoint it doesn't make

00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:20,010
any sense because it's not going to

00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:24,870
drive any more business to my to get a

00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:28,010
question if you think I'm full of crap

00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:28,010
to feel free to

00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:38,300
yeah well I mean we don't have enough

00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,670
for us there is only one repository

00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,930
there is only one code if you remember

00:55:40,670 --> 00:56:01,460
the order the green polo you have full

00:55:41,930 --> 00:56:02,690
commit access right okay yeah that it's

00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,120
almost that we can spend another hour

00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:08,450
talking about that it's because because

00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:10,460
we it's fine I mean I the example in

00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,830
this whole thing is 12 inch canonical

00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,480
and Shuttleworth you know Mark

00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:16,520
Shuttleworth is the benevolent dictator

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,020
of a bunt to self-proclaimed benevolent

00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,810
and he spent millions and millions and

00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,980
millions of his own money on this okay I

00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,180
don't see it as much anymore about any

00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,220
succumb to these shows no just stacks

00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:28,160
here bunt to CDs boom boom boom boom get

00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:30,350
you some above onto CDs and it's caused

00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,230
a lot of friction between if seeing the

00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:35,810
genome issues and the Banshee issues and

00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:39,050
you know as a business man Mark

00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:42,110
Shuttleworth makes decisions that piss

00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:45,470
other people off and so there's there's

00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:47,420
some there's some contention between the

00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:51,080
open source project and how one company

00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:52,910
is consuming that obese project but I

00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,250
think in the long run it benefits

00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,620
everybody just because they're you know

00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:59,360
the stuff that canonical creates for the

00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:02,510
most part all of that is under an open

00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,700
source license so I'm very much as

00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,410
someone who's run an open source project

00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:10,660
or been involved in open source project

00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:13,670
for ten years now I'm very big fan of

00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,260
show me the code you know the whole

00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,730
Jerry Maguire show me the money show me

00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,140
the code because when i started this

00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:20,240
people would send me email you know oh

00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,070
this is a great product but what you

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,830
need to do is and then send me a laundry

00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:27,620
list of stuff I need to do and I'm like

00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,069
no it's open source don't tell me what I

00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,009
need

00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:33,380
to do you know you run along and you

00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:35,749
know you show you write some code you

00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,249
you do it and then I'll gladly accept it

00:57:35,749 --> 00:57:39,170
and then on the other hand you get this

00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:40,670
guy says well I wrote this little piece

00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,469
of code I don't know how useful it is

00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,410
I'm not a real good Java programmer so

00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:47,239
and they'd send me this delightful

00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,859
perfectly commented usable piece of code

00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:50,920
for this little feature that hundreds if

00:57:48,859 --> 00:57:53,180
not thousands people found useful and

00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,709
those are the people I tried to attract

00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,329
but when it comes down to him the big

00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:58,009
fan of you know Shuttleworth stood up

00:57:56,329 --> 00:58:00,890
there he put up the money he's creating

00:57:58,009 --> 00:58:03,920
something and if you don't like it you

00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:06,469
can always for him now we very try very

00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,059
very hard we've never had the tensions

00:58:06,469 --> 00:58:12,469
that would cause a fort with an open a

00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:14,599
mess thank goodness and we do allow our

00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:16,849
community to have a lot of say I mean be

00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:18,559
it from when we decided what our

00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:19,699
copyright assignment policy was going to

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,819
be that came directly out of the

00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:24,410
community but it is it is something

00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:25,640
that's that's very you know if you're

00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,199
using your community strictly as

00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,209
marketing and you're using your

00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,119
community you know in that first slide

00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:34,579
of Steven Wally is you're going to

00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,559
you're gonna fail and if you look at o

00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:39,199
people who've adopted this kind of open

00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,239
core model that at least in my space

00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,609
they're going away I mean they're

00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:45,559
they're having to either they're just

00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:47,089
not doing open source anymore or they're

00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:57,109
having to radically change your business

00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:59,390
model oh now is this way I don't want to

00:58:57,109 --> 00:59:01,690
name names because it is over we're not

00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:04,219
by name but but we're all we're all one

00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,420
you know again is it says we all have

00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:07,219
different business models and things

00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,900
like anything that creates more open

00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:11,509
source code in my mind's a good thing

00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:13,339
but Google and Microsoft were probably

00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:15,529
two of the greatest producers of open

00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:18,499
source code about OSI approved license

00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:19,880
code every year they do millions of new

00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:21,140
zones of code but neither of those

00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,269
companies would describe themselves as

00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,709
an open source company and so that's

00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:27,319
kind of where it gets into I am actually

00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:29,569
out of time so but I'm more than willing

00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:32,180
to carry this on I'll be I'll be at the

00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:36,619
party tonight I'm going over to spots

00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:39,140
talk in his keynote in 20 minutes but I

00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:40,249
really appreciate your time I hope I

00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,790
didn't bore you i didn't see anyone

00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:43,920
sleep so I'm glad

00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:45,950
good and thanks thanks for having me up

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,950
here

00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,200
what about this I can help you like it

01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:06,880
we have the same problem for what

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,880
happened on the few haters you gave me I

01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:12,199
let's let the word out

01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,910
you

01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,390
you

01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:28,130
as a service leader in cloud computing

01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,720
all we do is hosting computing to us the
