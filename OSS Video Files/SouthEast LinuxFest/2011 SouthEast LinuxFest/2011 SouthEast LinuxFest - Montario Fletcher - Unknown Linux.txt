the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,900
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,400

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,060
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,210
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,929
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,640
make these videos possible and and we

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,570
all know that we've used windows long

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,050
enough it tends to get sluggish it tends

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,570
to pretty much no get to a point where

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,610
it's almost unusable and if you're using

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,440
certain version windows it will just

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,320
start working completely completely

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:59,969
until you reinstall windows and so those

00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,280
were my main reasons for switching all

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,630
right enough I've tried a variety of

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,200
different lenses I mean I've never

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,140
actually tried to transition our list of

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,119
our before right about 5-6 times before

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,189
our finally guy right and you know part

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,409
one of the reasons was that Lynch was

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,909
still for the desktop was still maturing

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,350
I mean there was so many guys want to

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,180
start using lists I mean it didn't

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,930
support a lot of the hardware that does

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,600
no I mean you have all these different

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,759
no wimp like when modems like has

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,100
happened at didn't working Linux had my

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,909
had internal dsl modem I don't know why

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,270
I went that route but notice my internal

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,700
modem I was home dsl at the time when I

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,649
first start using less and it would not

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,829
work and so and so Erica because those

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,659
different reasons and I'm mystified a

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,290
lot of open source software at that time

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,319
wasn't as mature I ain't had to go back

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,890
to windows and

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:18,389
so so I used redhead manly why was that

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,209
Mercer which was 2002-2004 I try to win

00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:25,439
linux and if anybody remember when linux

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:28,049
is basically allows you to install linux

00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,969
from within windows but what made when

00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:34,260
that's unique was a rant on a fat32

00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:35,879
partition which was something that was

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,120
unheard of and that's something that's

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,810
not really not recommended because no

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,739
you can't really secure factory to and

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,760
so one time try tried to uninstall linux

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:54,299
and pretty much you just now I couldn't

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,359
do anything beyond tired man Drake was

00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:01,489
it was good no distro but at the same

00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:04,349
time he has some limitations at time I

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:08,129
tried debian I like they're being for

00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:11,090
the most part but you know but for me

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:14,669
debian I had Devon as one of my servers

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,340
my small servers that was testing lives

00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:20,549
in a server environment and I liked it

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,120
but you know but I find they've been to

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,069
be a little bit too complex now I made

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,989
back in that back when I started using

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,019
davion but I mean now I can probably use

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:35,069
it but at the time I found it was so

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,870
confusing I used fedora I'm at a light

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,799
fedora the only gripe i have about

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,540
fedoras it didn't it was hard to make

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,879
proprietary code its work and so and

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,909
leaving fedora ubuntu i'm actually

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,400
usually bunchy right now own thing like

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:55,889
three or four of my machines and i love

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,650
using ubuntu i also tried coupon to

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,159
before I truck who brought you first but

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,650
one day notice about coupon to is but a

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,269
lot of decay te didn't necessarily match

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,349
up with what was going on with the

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,549
config files I mean I mean those last

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:16,590
year I don't know if that's been

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:19,889
improved or not but for me coupon to I

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,460
even do i like the KD interface I just

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,970
find that know for certain tests like

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,039
for like wireless internet it kind of

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,660
did it kind of some strange things where

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:32,300
sometimes I could connect and sometimes

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,580
I couldn't but that just my experience I

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,139
mean Samiha probably probably your

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,610
experience is probably different and

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,940
recently I started using less mint oh my

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,090
one of my laptops and I mean I really

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:51,530
enjoy using that distro I mean I find to

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:54,259
be even even simpler than 12 but first I

00:04:51,530 --> 00:05:00,440
must serve our home i'm using ubuntu

00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:05,330
which I'll talk about a little later all

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,130
right when we installing windows life

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,990
you if you don't not mean I talk about

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,570
you my computer that has windows

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,979
pre-installed about if you just want

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,789
install windows from scratch you buy

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,680
from the store you only got like certain

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:21,169
programs know you got a few games and

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,349
stuff but you don't have any you'll have

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:27,729
your office suite don't have your stuff

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:31,550
that you need to really get stuff done

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,530
whereas with linux that lets comes to

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,389
know you have different distros and if

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,880
distros have all the software that you

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:42,560
need based on what you want to use lens

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:46,219
for and we know we all know what windows

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,789
you have a lot of security issues you

00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:52,310
know ID always having my patches and one

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:55,789
things for our marks office they don't

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,190
always update the security

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,680
vulnerabilities and tongue manner now

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,599
they notice I one that was they waited

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,580
like a year before they actually patch

00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:10,250
it up but I mean and with windows yet

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:16,099
have run your antivirus your

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:19,820
anti-spyware you know I'm a in utter

00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:22,190
like anti malware programs you have to

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,110
run down windows or linux is pretty much

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,280
secure from struck from these set up

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,289
from get go I mean you can run antivirus

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,710
own list if you want to not like if you

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:35,680
are using windows files you're sharing

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,930
spouse with another user and you don't

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,420
want them you don't want to invert lee

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,730
sin that verse through your machine

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,950
either even though you're very diverse

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,500
won't affect your machine it could

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,970
affect your your friends machines if

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,640
they still using windows and my third

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,940
point between one silences window she

00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,580
had to go to all them places like if you

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,850
want your antivirus got go this vendor

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,500
like if you want your office suite you

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:11,770
go to microsoft guy use their disk I

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,740
mean different software you have to go

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,770
to different places where linux uses a

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,750
repository and I find that unique

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,380
because for trying to eat because all

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,690
you have to do is just no type in few

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,600
commands or go to your package manager

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,750
select what you want install for an

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:35,440
internet and makes it so much simpler to

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:38,410
install and under store and of course

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,270
then we understand from Lansing it it

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,730
really does a good job clean itself up

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:49,000
which with Windows you have a lot of

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:56,740
junk left behind alright in question so

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,040
far and of course no programs like all

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,210
comes down to Titus different philosophy

00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,770
windows programs for the most part going

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,850
to pay for them although there are some

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:08,650
freeware alternatives with linux most

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,890
things it most everything is like free

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:16,300
as in beer is for is there for a very

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,770
few stuff for some few exceptions and of

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,100
course i said before you have to go to

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,830
dif different places to get your

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,650
software some self reactant stuff from

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,950
CD something the internet whereas what

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,880
lens just go one one place and just

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,770
update and one things about one of the

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,950
software is that you have one package is

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,960
that try to do it as much as possible

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,580
what's with lunch you have is focus on

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,470
just one test

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:49,120
well so you don't have to worry about no

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,380
having to jack of all trades and I

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:57,510
expert nothing but your lint software is

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,510
designed to do one particular task well

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:08,980
and so going to talk about know some my

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:11,250
work stations that have at home this is

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,290
my desktop that I purchase last year

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:19,650
this one run a bunch to loosen Lynch no

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:22,360
10.4 sa AMD athlon dual core processor

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,750
during 20 gig hard drive and 3 gigabytes

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,000
around and on this machine it came

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,990
preloaded windows seven however my how I

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,480
white windows setting off that machine

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,140
so i guess you can guess how many times

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,650
i run windows 7 on a per ticket machine

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:46,210
but but really i bought this machine

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:48,040
mainly to test linux i mean i had just

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,330
about time that was wearing windows I

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,030
didn't want to touch it at that

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:56,110
particular moment and so with that and

00:09:52,030 --> 00:10:00,100
so with this machine I basically no

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:02,680
installed ubuntu I did some tweaking and

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,930
spent like several months working on

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,610
this machine and while I was working the

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:11,680
machine I noticed I wasn't even touching

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:14,290
my Windows machine I mean I me all my

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,370
hardware work my prince had like to have

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:23,380
a MJ per fledged friend that worked all

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:28,480
the time coming pretty much I just hook

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:32,290
up my peripherals and just works whereas

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,790
for windows yet to yeah I to have your

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:39,160
drivers CD you have to install your

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:41,050
drivers and some of your driver cds come

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,300
with all this extra software that you

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,470
have to install in order to get the

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,060
thing to work and I mean I mean who

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,600
wants to have all this extra software

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,320
just if you want to install a printer

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,370
you just need to drugs right

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,550
you don't need to have like this sweet

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,760
that comes with with this printer you

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,340
know you don't need to have the software

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,720
to like print pictures because you

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,920
probably already got your software's

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,890
print Christians already right I mean

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,130
same thing we know with like Senate like

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,770
you install a wireless card you don't

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,100
need to install all this extra software

00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:27,350
if you just want to get your wireless

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,930
card work just use the software that

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:35,090
comes with the operating system and so

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,480
pretty much this machine just used to

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:42,590
like my main office system use my

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,270
internet email no I also do watch the

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,670
movies on this machine because it can

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:50,750
handle it and one day's notice about

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:55,280
Linux's I had three gigs around but it's

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:59,270
hard using over 11 gig and so I got like

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,880
two gigs around not being used whereas

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,760
if I was running windows it'll probably

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,070
be using all around and then be using

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,570
all that swap space and they've slowed

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:16,460
down system but with linux everything

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:22,250
everything is just pretty much a pretty

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:26,320
much responsive and and this machine i

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:28,760
have not had to do a reinstall of ubuntu

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,190
matter of fact this machine runs just as

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,440
well as they did when i started a year

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:42,260
ago and thanked i started year ago

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:49,370
Monday so so we can see how linux is so

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:51,080
much reliable all right

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,450
now here's my network this is my

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,650
favorite because this is actually hooked

00:12:53,450 --> 00:13:00,830
up to my TV and so why was in my

00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:04,010
apartment actual with haywire running

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,690
from my from my wireless router to the

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,540
network because it was good it was so

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:11,390
close I got my living room my office pc

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,640
in the same same area whereas in my

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,970
house they're in a separate place so

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,550
hence i have to have a no wireless card

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,520
i could have run wire but i didn't feel

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:26,000
like doing it at the time although i may

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,430
do that in the future but pretty much

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,360
you know let's have a intel atom

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:36,230
processor have 16 gig of hard drive

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,360
space and originally came one gig around

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,210
i was able to upgrade your two gigs even

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,860
though the text the tape message on the

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,570
maximum amount you put in this machine

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,820
was one gig but notes so that tells you

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:56,510
that sometimes you can't trust your tech

00:13:49,820 --> 00:14:00,410
manuals and so this machine also running

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,510
a bunch of Lucien Lynch and my favorite

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,279
software around this machine is Boxxy

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:09,920
all right how many are free with boxxy

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:11,779
all right how I feel yo I me the cool

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,750
thing by boxes that not only does it

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:18,230
play almost anything you throw at it but

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,900
it also allows you to know update your

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,810
facebook says no pull videos from your

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:28,310
facebook friends medela day I was like

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:30,650
watching stop my life watching this I

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,860
crazy video that when my friends posted

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,040
on Facebook and pretty much she was like

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,360
and printing outside it was great to be

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,480
able to watch it from one application

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,540
without having to leave and have to open

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:49,010
a web browser go to connect Facebook and

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:52,700
try to just watch the video and so

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:56,180
that's my favorite part about my net

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,450
talk how do i do sometimes have to over

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,490
web browser to watch the movies that i

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,970
can't stream through boxy

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:08,089
but no but no it's pasta gets better a

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,450
man i'm quite sure we won't have to over

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:13,250
try to open web browser I mean you know

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,580
boxer does come with this on boxee

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,640
browser but I do find it is not complete

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,080
yet and one of the ancient you notice

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,600
about open source software is that

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,790
sometimes no they don't wait for the

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,970
sufferer to just be quote quote mature

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:32,290
to release it they just release it is

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:36,410
invite user feedback to make far better

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,990
and so for some people some people like

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,390
that approach and other people that just

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,540
wants tough to work they may not like it

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:49,820
but that just thought you have to my

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:52,790
different schools of thought originally

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:56,779
I had a one terabyte hard drive attached

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:59,630
to this net top I have since no removed

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:03,170
it and just use it as a backup source

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:06,020
and so now all my media is straying

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:09,500
right from my server which I'll talk

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:14,420
about in a little bit and then one of

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:16,700
the reasons i switch switch away media

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,100
server is because the 1i want to be at

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,360
essence on my meter from where I'm at

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:25,970
and number two my hard drive because

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,160
generally I leave this computer own even

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,560
though I don't need to and notice that

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,980
kind of were up my one terabyte hard

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,649
drive so it's not as it's not as

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,990
response to as it used to be meme do I

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,899
did try to do certain things like its

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:44,630
own file system tests and stuff I may

00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:49,670
try to reformat see if that will help

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:51,649
but but for me I just found that take

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,560
take out the hard drive for it when free

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:59,570
one of my USB ports and just run

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,529
everything off the network all right

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,529
enquiry so far

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:13,740
okay now my netbook i actually purchased

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:16,860
unlike on thanksgiving day but a couple

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,809
years ago and i got from bestbuy when

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:24,900
the node net when the netbooks were

00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:28,650
popular and i paid 179 for it and the

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:32,669
regular price was 299 and so I got a

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,260
good deal on it this I mean and for the

00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:37,679
long for a long time i was running

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,200
windows XP home on it but the outside

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,179
with my success to my neck top and what

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,450
the success that I'm having with my

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:50,490
desktop I'm going to try to put lunch on

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:54,440
this netbook as well and no and I went

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:56,760
with the netbook edition of a buncher I

00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,690
mean I guess you can tell you I like

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:04,320
Ubuntu right but here's the find about

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,750
about a buncha when I first went to use

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,030
it like a couple years ago I really

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:13,309
didn't like it I mean I really found it

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:17,040
was to dumb down for me as a power user

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:20,160
but but over the years and i see that

00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,080
you buncha has like really matured now I

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,890
noticed that with unity I know there's a

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,720
lot of controversial unity and I haven't

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,809
had a chance to try the latest virtual

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,830
ubuntu but from what I'm saying I really

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:36,660
don't like that interface you know it's

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,900
one thing to try to improve your face

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,860
but as a whole nudge to just mess it up

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,110
I mean yeah I mean I was watching a i

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,360
was watching our con leche journal and

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,210
they will talk about one of the biggest

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,470
beast about unity it's like they try to

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:59,130
be like at mac OS x by having a dark and

00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:01,440
tried to combine windows pinning and

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,870
unfortunately i think they did they

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,700
didn't get right this time hopefully you

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,640
know people give feedback and doe

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,230
improve their face for the next release

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,669
but I mean one thing I do notice about

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,779
open source communities that they do

00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,729
listen

00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:24,749
they may not agree with you but they

00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:28,289
were listed and so with his netbook i I

00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:30,690
didn't wipe out the windows XP partition

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:34,019
into a really property I could do it

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:37,669
right now if I want to because our

00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:41,519
rivers as comfortable for some reason to

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,590
give her the windows XP partition but

00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,929
here by the funny thing is I haven't

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:51,769
been to that window section partition in

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,769
months so wondering why I still got it

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,450
but no for me I mean I'm not cool one

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,950
day you know your nose Prime Minister

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:04,789
I'm not a techie tech guy no dead dasa

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,289
tech jargon I try to be rural people and

00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:09,899
I believe they got to be real people

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,419
because because people because real

00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:15,179
people use linux I mean we're trying to

00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:19,879
get everybody to embrace list and not

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:26,099
just those are just tech savvy right

00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:29,219
mm-hmm and so and so with this I use

00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:31,139
this often when I'm traveling is that if

00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:34,799
I want to do i watch movies and stuff

00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:36,299
then I bring my other laptop which which

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:42,059
I'll talk about in a few minutes that is

00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:47,399
much more beefier than this one and so

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:50,549
with this ubuntu lucid let's netbook i

00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:53,519
miss that intel atom dual-core processor

00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:57,869
and 11 and here's the funny thing about

00:20:53,519 --> 00:21:01,259
this particular this netbook if i run in

00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:05,159
windows no just text one chord I run

00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:09,359
linux it detects to why is that I don't

00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:14,969
know but I guess that's another thing

00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:17,309
that lenses got incorrect and so just

00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:21,409
netbook has one gig around can't you

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:24,239
can't really or upgrade this particular

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:27,830
model because don't have like one ram

00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,830
slot and just one gig around

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,789
all right those took art I think I'll go

00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:38,129
back to this net top I was gonna say

00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:41,399
something maybe I maybe I'll go back

00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:44,129
he'll come back to me all right this

00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:47,730
laptop was the last machine to actually

00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:51,210
put linux on I'm approximately it was

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:53,700
running vista and with me this when when

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,580
i first used vista actually really like

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,559
vista but then i started saying it will

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,690
start getting buggy and start slowing

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:06,830
down never crashed on me though not like

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:09,690
windows XP did but I did notice that it

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:12,480
windows vista was just getting to a

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,299
point where i start up he'll take x 5 10

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,710
minutes just to make me have the desk

00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,740
I'll useful I mean it will show desktop

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,059
within about two or three minutes but I

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,710
really couldn't use the computer for

00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:31,590
another 7 which much to me is

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:36,119
unacceptable and for n for me I did I

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:38,279
did reinstall vista so like the first

00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:40,019
thing I did with this was i did--like i

00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,419
didn't wanna wear my neck top is i

00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:45,509
actually created do dual boot system

00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:49,799
would at that time those another virtue

00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:53,269
bun to my Lucien list but later I

00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:56,700
decided to replace that hard drive and

00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:59,549
replace that once it actually had 160

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,970
gig hard drive our place where 500

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:06,539
gigabyte hard drive because I want to

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:11,039
have that as a second like medias by

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:13,649
media system now this is assistant I use

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,830
like if I'm traveling and I want watch

00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:20,029
movies like I'm going somewhere my debt

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:26,980
by my netbook I use it from around town

00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:31,150
maybe take care of some business and so

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:34,299
so this laptop has right now has let's

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:39,010
meet Julia notice version 10 now do know

00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:41,860
that version 11 has come out I mean

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,840
within which I will try you know shortly

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:48,660
but right now if you guys think that's

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:52,090
working why rush to upgrade it and

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:55,090
that's nothing i like about Linux's you

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:59,110
don't have to be forced to upgrade your

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,820
OS I mean you can say where yet i'll do

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,630
some distros you know going to get the

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:09,840
latest updates but if you but if you

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:13,710
focus on but if you want a stable OS

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,710
nobody's going to force you to upgrade

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,080
and so for this one i do do some like my

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,890
office suite but i also have a couple of

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,070
boxes well in this system and I do have

00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:29,260
some of my movies and my music on there

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:32,860
but I don't put don't put everything on

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,290
it because number one I have half the

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,730
storage as my one chair of our hard

00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,730
drive so I can't put everything on there

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:46,929
and num2 I do use it occasionally for

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:48,549
business purposes all right and by front

00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:52,870
of machine that I've convertible to

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:54,490
lynch was this server now let me tell i

00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,250
have a funny story about this particular

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:01,360
machine when i bought this machine off

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:04,750
of ebay you know it had my motherboard

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,260
and it would not accept any type of atom

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:11,410
cards slide the pci bus was just corrupt

00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,530
and i did like by also grades and stuff

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,940
and it just would not work and so in

00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,510
order to get network i had to let you

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,910
buy a USB device now fast forward to

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,100
after I got my desktop I decided I

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,820
wanted to revitalize this machine I want

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:30,580
to bring some life to it but it but

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,190
unfortunately but the networking issues

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,460
with it with the PCI issues it just

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,720
wasn't practical so i decide i decided

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,309
to go on tigerdirect

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,799
and i actually purchased that motor

00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:47,809
board for it for about sixty nine bucks

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:50,980
and i actually took to the chip out the

00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:53,510
old one and putting the new one and

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,120
that's like the first time I've ever did

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,590
that and the funny thing is like the

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,590
first time I tried boot the machine up

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,870
it would not turn on and I was I trying

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,480
to figure out why every day connected

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,490
properly I was like looking online

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,549
trying to see what why the machine would

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:14,690
not turn on and I look now found this

00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:16,070
one blog post about about screws they

00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,750
said if you've happens if you have the

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,690
screw in the wrong place it will cause

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,429
machine not boot up and I doubt that was

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:26,090
just that's just ridiculous that makes

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,340
no sense but I change this prove I moon

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:36,169
screw from one area to another area mud

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:38,210
board amazingly it booted up was that

00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,039
goes to show you that just because she

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,710
knows about computers doesn't

00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:45,530
necessarily mean that everything's going

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:50,000
to always go ABC sometimes she has to do

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:52,100
some weird things and I saw this article

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,820
that said explain why this this is like

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,679
why you have to really have your screws

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:07,580
in a certain spot on the motherboard

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:10,250
birds I didn't understand it alright so

00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:14,720
I was there to brandons machine back to

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:18,020
life for my two DVD burners this one the

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,970
Ubuntu Lucien Lynch server edition at

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,890
first I was going to go with fedora but

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:28,100
the reason I decided not to go if door

00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:31,400
cuz buy the fedora does installed a GUI

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:34,970
and I really didn't at the time want to

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:38,570
it's all gooey which means I if I had to

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:41,360
if I saw for fedora I had to go back and

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:44,650
change settings to actually make it work

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,650
just like just on the command line

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,020
and so with a bunch of lucid lynx man I

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:55,080
have to worry about trying to install a

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:57,210
GUI because with this machine I don't

00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,330
have a I don't have monitor nor a

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,490
keyboard hooked up to it and so when it

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:06,870
boots up it's already setting the bar

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:11,130
soon not yet for the keyboard and so

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:15,000
with this machine I used to SSH SSH like

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:18,420
across my land and also use this machine

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,930
to like do my tunneling especially when

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,580
I was that when I was teaching you know

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,900
how you know you go you go so many

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,610
places that have all these Forster to

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:32,220
firewalls I actually used I didn't stash

00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:35,480
district machine actually use my other

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:40,380
machine and I were you I will actually

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,780
create a ssh tunnel and I'll just turn

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,330
them all my network traffic like for the

00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,920
stuff that they blocked our channel it

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,460
through this machine to my home internet

00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,750
connection to get by and the funny

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,970
things like my students taught me do it

00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,460
one day and asking me how do you do it

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:59,190
and over me being a good teacher I

00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:02,790
didn't tell him except on the last day

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,770
of school when they were gone I tried to

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,740
explain to them and they gave me during

00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:14,010
the headlights look they like they did

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:17,550
not understand at all but this machine

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:19,230
originally had one gig around like with

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,890
the old mud boy I tried upgrading around

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:25,080
one around that that ran 12 ram slots

00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:28,380
was just corrupt it wouldn't take

00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,410
anymore realm so at the new mud where i

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,730
was i bought a 4 gigabyte ram stick use

00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,040
it with that one gauge so I'm right now

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:41,640
have five years around but this machine

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:43,650
can also hold up to 16 gigabytes as i

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,910
know what i'm going to do with 16 goo

00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,800
bodies well i do do a lot of virtual I'm

00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:54,050
trying to learn more about

00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,670
virtualization and so I try so I like to

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,169
create a lot of virtual machines and run

00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,509
off this machine

00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:05,700
and so with so with the virtualization

00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:08,129
though I'm able to utilize all this

00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,739
realm and we're going to get some more

00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:16,409
rim in a few months to try max out to 16

00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:20,269
so I have like different VMs running and

00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:22,710
so so I have a two terabyte hard drive

00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:26,249
remember that media I was talking about

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:30,389
to having that USB hard drive that's

00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:32,279
where it went and so now i'm using that

00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:35,279
one terabyte you just as a backup to my

00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,669
media because it only has like maybe 60

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,029
gigs of media on it and so right now

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:44,129
just using as a secondary storage and

00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:49,830
also you have it not where I could just

00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:52,619
take my you my USB hard drive and just

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:56,389
plug into my laptop and actually access

00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:59,460
my media from there when I'm on the road

00:30:56,389 --> 00:31:02,580
and another thing I did with that hard

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,309
drive in the beginning was because I

00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,139
because at the time I didn't really

00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:09,480
trust when it was couple years ago trust

00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:12,509
lynched couple years ago and so what I

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,759
did was I actually loaded the Linux

00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,840
operating system on that hard drive and

00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:21,230
I said to where it could boot from the

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,539
hard drive so I went to school one day I

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,159
plugged my hard drive of course into my

00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:29,700
laptop at the time I left over simmering

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,799
windows vista so I plugged it in i was

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,850
able to note on my pc no you know and we

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,759
were talking this was the last day of

00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,820
school so i want to do this like during

00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:44,129
the regular school year so i plug it in

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:51,090
and the kids when they saw the interface

00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:52,710
are like what is this I mean I mean I

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,769
mean if you look in the public school

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:59,549
today linux really it's not you don't

00:31:55,769 --> 00:32:01,230
see it in public schools at all you do

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:04,350
use do see more at colleges but you'll

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,259
see in public schools and now here's the

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,240
fun day is in Georgia where I you teach

00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,580
it

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,910
the curriculum actually calls for

00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,010
microsoft windows it actually calls for

00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,380
market are protestant says in the

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,480
standard the students will create

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,290
presentations with Microsoft PowerPoint

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:28,880
it didn't just say create presentations

00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:30,800
and so and so we really is are we doing

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,429
our kids injustice by trying to teach

00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,480
these kids marks off stuff well we

00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:38,690
should be just teaching how to use a

00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:42,670
computer because a lot because if they

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:45,230
are those windows still dominant but

00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:48,290
eventually you still have come to that

00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,440
just use linux and the f come come to

00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:54,140
use other operating systems and if you

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,820
have else have like machines that like

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,420
my cash registers that run their own

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:02,179
custom operating system if there are

00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:05,059
they not do is run Windows then they

00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:07,120
have a hard time adjusting to run those

00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:09,850
cash register its run those other

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,120
running lengths and run all these other

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,950
operating systems and so really I think

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,330
in the school since we need to really

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:25,480
push for teaching kids how to use a

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,480
computer not just necessarily Microsoft

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,850
and so so i guess no we're just talking

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:39,620
i'm bringing a bishop bridge in both

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:42,590
topics that was assigned so so good okay

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:47,660
let's talk about my lessons learned what

00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:49,850
did i learn from this num 1 when most

00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,360
still exists but they're actually fewer

00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:55,970
now and those that usually when when

00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,260
modems somebody's finally found a way to

00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:03,590
actually hack the drivers and provide

00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:07,130
drivers for us but there are a few that

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:09,740
you have to have windows in my woods now

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,530
thank by my blackberry generally no your

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:16,040
blackberry Jim runs on windows only or

00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:18,800
maybe on Mac but what they vary by

00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,300
software project I'm able to connect

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,940
sync my blackberry using Linux

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,990
and so if you don't know what Barry is I

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,930
mean you can talk to me after the

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:34,130
conference that will take more about it

00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:36,140
and plus i also use that software to Ted

00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:40,520
to my internet connection when I'm away

00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:42,410
and not at a Wi-Fi spot all right you

00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,440
also have a few proprietary hardware

00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:49,250
devices that requires windows just to

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,780
try to use it or out to set it up and I

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:54,320
think for the most part a lot of these

00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,990
like 3G and 4G modems I know most of

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,280
some of them require you to use windows

00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:04,660
well as they won't work at all and I

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,400
know like linksys routers another son

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:13,700
wonder I how many of you use linksys

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:16,310
routers all right I know the 11 linksys

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,010
router that I had it required me to use

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,050
a Windows installation disk now I don't

00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:25,460
know if it's this fits true or not to

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,840
come in all right I how many deer fight

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,180
for those who that have links to sprouts

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:35,210
you still have windows to install kits

00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:39,860
are using Linux alright so you were

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:42,380
successful doing it okay so we just have

00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:46,430
we do have like a variety of success

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:49,250
with that but what it would average end

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:53,540
user would they be willing to just

00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:56,150
remote into it to actually to the router

00:35:53,540 --> 00:36:06,770
or whatever I just have one just to do

00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:09,350
so for all right I like wine but for me

00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:11,390
wine just doesn't run every every single

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:14,320
windows program that's out there I mean

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,150
it can run some and if you have like

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,560
play less or CodeWeavers crossover

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:23,480
crossover prog you can run more programs

00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,710
than linux but it doesn't but you still

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,140
don't have that wonderful sake

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,029
comparability

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:33,519
I know like love my bible study software

00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:36,640
that you use they used to use its

00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:41,440
windows only I mean it will win out

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:44,799
round one and when I look online 44 ways

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,390
to work get work on the one I mean right

00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:54,460
now there is no wait they're not any way

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:57,660
for you to run yes okay so what is 11 is

00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:00,609
is a combative is a compatibility layer

00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:03,069
for our links that allows you to

00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:07,119
interpret like marks are windows calls

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:09,069
so one kind of list is that link that

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,569
allows you to run Windows programs

00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:16,599
without having windows installed all

00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:21,819
right that's a good question i'm glad

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:23,769
brought that out alright if you envy me

00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:27,369
buddy else has any questions I mean feel

00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:30,430
free to ask of me I mean I don't like to

00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:36,430
do all the talking I like to have others

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:38,619
of our involvement and what in my

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:43,329
experience if you have a certain in it

00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:45,430
search providers a lot of times if you

00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:47,589
have been problems the first question

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,299
gonna ask you is what version women's

00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:55,150
are you running and if you running Linux

00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:57,099
good luck in trying to get help although

00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:04,569
sometimes you can't escalates hard go

00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:07,990
ahead all right let me get you on Mike

00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:09,789
coming we got to yeah we got to get you

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:16,779
on the mic so we can cuddle recording

00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:18,759
this so okay so in my experience this is

00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:21,069
improving I look around the room I see

00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:24,039
several max in the room and you know

00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:28,960
about five years ago being a Mac admin

00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:32,109
myself technically you know you'd say to

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,490
an ISP i'm running a mac we don't

00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:36,730
support macs we're in s'pore max now

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,619
it's incredible i mean you know oh yeah

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,569
okay yeah well we'll help you will

00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:42,719
support the mac

00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:44,579
but pretty much if you know some of the

00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,109
basics on how to troubleshoot networking

00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,049
how to determine whether or not you have

00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:51,150
an IP address how to ping and those are

00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:53,009
you know GUI tools now with in Linux now

00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,630
I mean a lot of times you don't even

00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:58,199
really need to even call your isp yeah

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,519
so you know but the point is that a lot

00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,489
of that's improving where they used to

00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:11,279
just say oh you do what now they don't

00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:14,819
do that anymore mm-hmm yes yeah I have

00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:17,489
to agree with that I mean I'm even

00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:19,769
wilcox and i've called cox several times

00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,420
and they haven't like they were doing to

00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:24,239
ask you what OS you running in more

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,119
digits as you do these basic

00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:31,229
troubleshooting steps and pretty much i

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:34,170
was able to get things resolved and uses

00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:36,630
it always had to turn up turn out that d

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:42,539
is there is old it was always on their

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:45,509
end but but if you ask the average user

00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:49,380
to do that i mean would the average

00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:52,199
end-user be able to like throw shoot

00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:55,109
their network condition alone I mean we

00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:58,259
want them to but right now to me that's

00:39:55,109 --> 00:40:00,150
not the reality and so I mean real deep

00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:03,119
the folks on the stock is more on a

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:09,359
novice look level but I mean any

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:10,739
feedback is welcome okay let's talk

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,579
about some positives you notice to have

00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,930
more positives than negatives one reason

00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:19,890
is because I believe that is the

00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:23,759
important that we all remain positive in

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:25,799
life all right stability think I'll talk

00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:28,819
about this earlier I talked about my

00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:32,940
bunch of machine running from one year

00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:35,880
exclusively ubuntu i think it might slow

00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:38,849
down just a little bit but pretty much

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:44,359
it's just it runs like it did when i

00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:49,469
first installed it simply works I mean

00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:52,510
plugin i plug in any device I mean like

00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:55,090
plugging this USB device this USB

00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,790
all right thumb drive if you do if you

00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:59,980
plug in New thumb drive in windows it's

00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:03,760
got to do all this extra stuff start to

00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:06,700
install but with linux I'm playing it

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,740
like a thousand new thumb drives it

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:13,000
attached to write it all says do

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:16,270
anything extra and likewise I'm up nice

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,070
on the printer drivers plug in a printed

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:22,330
linux you ready to print of course you

00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,040
have a network friend got to do a little

00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,310
bit more but there's seven IP address

00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,140
stuff like that but that's simple

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,890
where's for Windows you plug in the

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:36,100
printer you might be able to get the

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:39,640
drugs on a if if it's in the windows

00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:43,980
database otherwise you have to pop in

00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:46,240
the CD you know do the installation and

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:52,060
pray that you don't have to install all

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,160
this extra hardware my software all

00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:58,980
right most Windows software do have a

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,960
lens Knievel a'n't I mean obviously

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:05,260
obviously x marks our office equip is

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,870
Libre Office of course I used to use

00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:10,390
openoffice then you know one day when

00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:13,660
Oracle decide it was uncertain what they

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:16,560
were going to do it openoffice I decided

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:20,410
to just come migrate to the LibreOffice

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,930
even though like the Lucian Lance did

00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:25,390
show really at time didn't have a place

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:28,530
we installed LibreOffice I was able to

00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:31,390
search online and find a repository for

00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:35,170
libre office so I'm able to run some

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:39,520
running libre office even on older

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:42,070
versions of ubuntu all right works on

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,270
old hardware I remember one time having

00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:49,510
a having our old server an OPC that i

00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:53,670
bought from this computer store think i

00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:56,740
paid 99 bucks for it and so pretty much

00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,740
this software i had like two and 56 gets

00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:02,320
around and i was trying to wipe out when

00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:05,610
does it start linux the funny thing was

00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:08,590
i couldn't i get to install linux

00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:11,860
and I did a memtest i found out that one

00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:13,870
the memory sticks was bad but it was

00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,580
running when it was fun but some reason

00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:19,150
it wouldn't start with it so I took out

00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,190
that memory installed linux a command

00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:25,780
line version of debian and pretty much

00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:28,000
it was just good and pretty much that

00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,660
machine has like at wingate goodbye hard

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,430
drive so i was just using mentally for

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,900
for sharing by sharing a printer because

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,920
at time by didn't have a network printer

00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:45,460
i was just using like a parent connect

00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:48,520
via USB and so and so i was sharing that

00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:51,490
over the network I didn't want to hook

00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,770
it up to my main computer because

00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:56,580
sometimes I might sometimes I shut down

00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:01,210
my main career down [ __ ] shut down and

00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:03,490
really a date notice that time still

00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:07,630
running windows on that on why my main

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:09,090
machines and so I didn't want to have

00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,190
that printer dependent on that machine

00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:16,410
being up and window she had to reboot

00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:20,350
every so often claim really attribute

00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:21,940
really if you let go more than a day you

00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:26,590
would do need to reboot because the

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:30,010
performance is just awful but Melinda

00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:37,150
stars like I've let let run over several

00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:41,410
months and not have never slow down all

00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:44,620
right security I just start lince and

00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:48,010
just go windows yet to you you better

00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,560
not put a unpatched version wheels on

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,680
internet anybody i put version windows

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:57,790
that don't have antivirus anti-spyware

00:44:52,680 --> 00:45:02,530
out and whole nine yards and to me it's

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:04,710
like when you're trying to if you don't

00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,910
have your enterprise software on your

00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:10,030
somewhere store and you have to go

00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:13,140
online those are like the scariest

00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:16,360
moments because sometimes you don't know

00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,609
because you can get hat between cadets

00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,799
and internet

00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:25,950
and trying to stall the aunt of our

00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:31,019
software and you know talk about the no

00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:34,890
performance degradation meaning I think

00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:39,329
it right now meaning that it works

00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:42,779
pretty much from day one all right by my

00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:45,720
office I and my and my workplace we have

00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:50,039
like a couple nth servers that we run or

00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:53,970
cone and you know they still run but

00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:55,559
they were installed from like my first

00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:59,069
date doors thought of me there been some

00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,019
prefer know based on the data like I

00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:04,680
always have you have more data sometimes

00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:06,210
or queries too slow and so there's some

00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,099
things we're working on to improve that

00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:14,460
but pretty much everything is reliable

00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:19,650
now now where is also work on base and

00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:21,960
on base is almost windows so I work so

00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:27,349
just sounds like very few linux servers

00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:31,559
on Robins Air Force Base butt butt in

00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:33,660
but I HS we do use some netzer's we

00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:37,460
don't we don't we still use from windows

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:40,259
workstations kind of most companies but

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,349
pretty much sometimes you know you just

00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:46,650
have to deal with just do what you have

00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:55,739
at work of course at home you can do

00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:58,470
whatever you want ok now this size for

00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:02,460
news lets users what I would recommend

00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:04,170
to noon yet lets users now you know in

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,230
the past know if you want to try to

00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:11,579
learn shot you in start right now we got

00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:14,460
all these live CDs live my flash drives

00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,739
they just you can try all ends before

00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,440
you even install it and you can see how

00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:22,049
it works with different hardware before

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,759
you get to before you commit to one

00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:28,190
distro and use the Internet message

00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:31,250
board for help

00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,710
I mean don't be ashamed to ask questions

00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,720
but do research make sure your questions

00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,240
are being answered before you post a new

00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,839
question because I know some people

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,069
don't like to answer the same question

00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:48,310
that's our advances right elsewhere I

00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:50,630
know for me once when I was a teacher I

00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:55,069
didn't like my students asking me the

00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:57,910
same question that just went over the

00:47:55,069 --> 00:48:02,540
shows that they weren't paying attention

00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:06,260
so using it so use your internet message

00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,790
board and and though sometimes you may

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:12,950
have to read the manual even though

00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:15,910
sometimes man could be complex so so do

00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:20,510
your homework before you ask questions

00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:24,560
all right try right listen a dual-boot

00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:29,060
environment or a virtual machine and see

00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:32,839
how see how it works as a vm if you like

00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:36,680
it then just you can make you just make

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:40,310
transition easier and don't be afraid to

00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,250
just if you make a big mistake you can't

00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,510
fix it don't be afraid start over but of

00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:50,089
course makes you want make sure you keep

00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:52,369
your data safe and those and one things

00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:54,440
I started with my lair installations of

00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,690
Linux like on my lap talking on my

00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,390
server is I've started putting my day on

00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,550
separate partitions in the beginning i

00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:05,180
was i was doing Evan on one big

00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:08,089
partition and really that's not the

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,220
safest way to go and the reason for that

00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:12,710
is if you have to install Linux he has

00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:17,349
to reformat that partition gets one to

00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:20,290
your data it's gone whereas with if you

00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:23,109
restart if you put on separate partition

00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:25,880
that's less the chance that happening I

00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:29,359
don't make you lose days like you tell

00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:32,650
it to ferment whole drive which does

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,660
happen but if you have your data

00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:38,680
elsewhere like on a separate hard drive

00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,670
separate computer flash drive CD DVD

00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,740
where we have

00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,869
make sure you keep a but make sure you

00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:48,829
keep backups or your data if you were

00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:52,520
evaluated because we all know Murphy's

00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:58,059
Law anything that can go wrong usually

00:49:52,520 --> 00:50:01,520
will go wrong all right five minutes I

00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:05,119
think my clock is slow I was worried

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,530
about no finish early but at the

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:12,920
five-minute mark this is a good time for

00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:15,790
questions or comments all right okay go

00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,790
ahead which question

00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:37,710
ok the question was was am I am I still

00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:41,940
required to maintain a separate Lynch

00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:48,030
partition what making was any at all

00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:49,680
right for me I I'm do for myself when I

00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,990
was teaching the Pope school system i

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,570
did find myself having to run windows in

00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:59,460
a vm because a lot of their software

00:50:54,570 --> 00:51:02,790
just rent on your windows but right now

00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:06,450
with my employment IHS I don't yes I

00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:09,990
don't have to run windows at all indo

00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:13,140
life for some semi games I do sometimes

00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:16,080
have to have a windows partition so I'm

00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:18,600
not I'm set linux I think I like Sam

00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,060
like ninety-five percent because i

00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,850
rarely play games nowadays because i

00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:26,910
don't really have time because i got

00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:31,380
because i work after working on having

00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:34,020
to spend time my girlfriend no I have a

00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:40,640
life I mean there's more it like to just

00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,640
playing games alright no question

00:51:48,490 --> 00:52:09,770
yes okay okay the question was I'm

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,890
reason to repeat your question could be

00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:14,930
a record so the question was can I

00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:18,920
sprang display my experience were going

00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:20,240
from a limited windows no environment to

00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:33,010
environment and lens that slight

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:36,590
limitless was that the question okay

00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:38,690
okay i know for me when i was using

00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:42,170
windows knobs I was a power using

00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:44,119
windows and for me switch to linux I

00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:48,050
really had to learn everything all over

00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:51,380
again and one things that cuz I'm

00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:54,940
everything folks too much on my design

00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:57,859
my like customizing the stuff that was

00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,780
but the stuff those are self for linux I

00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:03,380
didn't do that I'm not doing that yet

00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:07,520
but i will do that but for me some

00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:09,680
things have realizes i wear my on the

00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,130
message boards I tried to think like

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:16,010
five companies on it for example you

00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:18,290
know I estar compass no behind rotating

00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:20,200
cube have multiple desktops which in

00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,630
Windows you know you don't have that and

00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:26,119
actually find myself in Windows having

00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:29,030
to download a program to enable multiple

00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,930
desktops but for me it was just more

00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:35,060
like it's just watching videos online

00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:37,630
going on going internet and pretty much

00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:41,390
just trying different things

00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:43,190
experimenting and just keep them back up

00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,920
copy my settings so if something went

00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:49,250
wrong like always go back did I answer

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:58,250
your question or you sure

00:53:49,250 --> 00:54:00,230
okay all right mainly you have what

00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:02,980
Howard equation was are dangerous

00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:06,320
between Ubuntu and coupon too and

00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:08,810
generally the donators I've seen is that

00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:14,660
where the kid is using the gnome desktop

00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:18,770
or if urban be leveraged of ubuntu UT vs

00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:22,190
que te but i do find that genome tends

00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:25,040
to marry d settings like we if you make

00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:27,710
a neighbor st. setting change in ubuntu

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,560
a generally rights to correct

00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:32,930
configuration in the background because

00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,810
everything and lynch really runs on the

00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:38,660
command line just the goo is just the

00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:43,180
restaurants on top of the actual command

00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:46,670
line but we're coupon to what KDE

00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:49,280
sometimes there's that disconnect aimed

00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:52,400
up and endo kitty looks more like

00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:56,180
windows at the same time I am I suppose

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,180
I find que te not this night not as

00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,590
usable and now and for me the only air

00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,430
that i didn't find kitty is useful

00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:07,700
within network and wireless networking

00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:11,200
all right ok so did ask your question

00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,200
all right you have question

00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:23,120
youtube yes I haven't watched netflix no

00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:25,940
I can't get no place to work because one

00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,680
thing shots realized by linux is you

00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,030
don't have the RL you don't have that

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,730
digital rights management that you have

00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:36,470
in Windows announced coming now in Mac

00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:39,440
OS and project part reason is Linux is

00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:43,120
meant to be a free system it's not meant

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:47,960
to be windows this is where your chain

00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:51,200
chain to go to and found by found by a

00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:55,250
different users like you know what drm

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,140
think the producers can limit your

00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:59,030
rights as you like what you get you what

00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:02,420
you can and cannot do with that

00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:04,880
particular media for instance they could

00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,560
say you can make one copy of that

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,650
particular media or didn't say you may

00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:14,150
not make any copies or they may say you

00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:16,730
may watch this video for 24 hours now

00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:18,710
that's how a lot of the rental system
