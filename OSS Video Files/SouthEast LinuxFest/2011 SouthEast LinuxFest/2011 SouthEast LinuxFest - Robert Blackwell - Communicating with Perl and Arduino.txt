the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,900
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,400

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,060
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,210
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,920
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,200
make these videos possible ok awesome

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,500
hey thanks so much for being here I'm

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,300
really excited about this technology so

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,090
hopefully I get you two so but I will

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,370
say this is some disclaimers right this

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,260
is a basic talk and for you early geeks

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,920
I don't mean basic programming right I

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,120
mean just basic elementary stuff it's

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,320
intro it's all about getting started I

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
mean this is a Linux conference so I

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,230
don't know exactly how many are all

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,149
programmers and how many are cysts

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,940
admins I don't know but obviously the

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,189
hello world is the normal hey it's my

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,960
tool chain working is this thing on can

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,729
I make something happen kind of program

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,830
and I'm definitely going to show you

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,229
that but I'm taking the idea of hello

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,659
world a little bigger and taking you

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,159
into the the world of Arduino a little

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,070
bit so you can see a little further and

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,600
get an idea of where you can get stuff

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,640
cuz you know yeah as we know by itself

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,770
is kind of boring so all right that said

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,610
have a pearl guy you may have looked at

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,490
my shirt and guessed that but this talk

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,850
could almost be Ruby it could almost be

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,750
Python Erling bash haskell you know I

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,130
don't care right um so and that'll make

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,369
more sense here in a little bit why I

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,930
don't care yeah so how many of you been

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,270
to the Arduino website all right you

00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:00,600
know what it is awesome how many of you

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,680
could say Arduino yeah that's good how

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,450
many of you used to have trouble saying

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:12,540
this yeah one guy all right all right

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:15,360
anyway pearl yeah so hello world

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,210
so this isn't just code right this is

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,180
this is my proverbial placeholder things

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,490
with stuff right it's hello world it's

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,000
hello Arduino hello stuff hello ideas

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,990
and just plain hey welcome everybody

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,790
someone try to let you know where you

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,470
can get some stuff because if you don't

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,320
have stuff well what do you have your

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,460
stuff lyst and that's just not good so

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,400
maybe you get a few ideas percolating

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,160
for you hopefully you have way more than

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,690
I have and can go out and rule the world

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,810
but we'll see so just a little about me

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,980
right I've been hacking way too long

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,790
from the Apple two days in rural

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,110
Arkansas 7-6 3 to 4 come with 264 ring

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,600
the bell anybody remember me on

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,740
compuserve anybody anyway so back in

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,280
those days if you'd have told me that

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,050
six wires and 10 lines of code I could

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,910
have taken the potentiometer and go on

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,590
put couch and the motor would have gone

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,960
towards rude I never would have left my

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,230
room right I would still be living at

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,090
home with my parents and just hacking on

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,360
stuff right just mail me cool stuff and

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,100
I'll keep hacking and so here's the code

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,490
for this this is straight from the

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,910
Arduino IDE I'm not going to go crazy

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,200
into this necessarily but I just kind of

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,960
want to let you see what the IDE looks

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,690
like dare Arduino is in C++ pretty much

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,820
sum hand-waving may apply anyway so you

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,490
pull in servo you get your object tell

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:49,900
it what pin your potentiometer is on the

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,430
little tricky bit here is where your

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,940
mapping values across two different

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,240
ranges because the potentiometer reads

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,840
from zero to without our from zero to

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,420
1,023 and the servo motor is from 0 to

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
179 so you just map values on each other

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,570
so you kind of normalize them that's

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,030
kind of a handy function so then when

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,800
you turn it goes pretty much where you

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,650
want and then of course you can turn the

00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,410
knob way faster then the thing can move

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,450
right so there's a delay in there so it

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,090
has a chance to play catch-up but anyway

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,020
this is what's called the knob sketch

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,610
completely from the IDE so

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,660
you go buy yourself a servo motor and an

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:36,120
Arduino and uh in a pot then you can do

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,259
this and just go to town Wow and I tried

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,280
to actually make the code where you

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,199
could see a little better and it looked

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,080
better in the IDE than it did otherwise

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,520
this is gonna be interesting okay so if

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,900
I stayed in my room I never would have

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,460
done this right so there would have been

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,020
some good things with me still living at

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,509
home right I wouldn't made my pilgrimage

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,919
when I used to be a microsoft guy that

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:57,330
was a few decades ago you can probably

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,889
tell by the sexy legs so anyway so now

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,599
what am i doing right well I've been

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,090
running Pittsburgh cruel workshop for

00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:05,120
years pearl conferences i do ignite

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,069
working on a maker faire in pittsburgh

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,340
i'm an evangelist for all the cool stuff

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,479
right and this was kind of something

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,610
that's come out of this conference for

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,830
me is also a bit of product which is

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,000
different than tech but that's cool

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,919
because fossa is some of the best

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,479
technology right but some of our product

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,039
just sometimes lacking and i'm not going

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
to get into arguments about that but

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,880
it's true and i'm right and you're quite

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,020
wrong if you think different anyway but

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,000
we also don't always have the best

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,229
marketing and that's why i'm here i'm

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,909
definitely not part of the arduino

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:39,090
cooler I'm not part of the Arduino team

00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:43,169
anyway I'm a user and and I love it and

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,090
I want you to as well so um some of you

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,490
require already playing with them and if

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,539
not you will be or at least I think you

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,279
should be so what is it right oh sorry

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,889
I'm from Pittsburgh and I don't think

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,330
weird things happen so by the way if

00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,520
you're ever scheduling conferences don't

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,719
schedule against NFL playoff games which

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,990
happened at the last time I gave this

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:06,300
talk that just sucks so Arduino language

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,210
is based on cnc four plus links against

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,639
the AVR lipsy and allows the use of any

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,259
of its own functions right so that's

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,130
about as geeky down in the tool changes

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:20,610
i would get so it's a microcontroller

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:23,639
it's an IDE it's a culture it's a it is

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,310
open source and of course it's amazing

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,930
magic or it wouldn't be interesting whoa

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,060
wait a minute well this is ide business

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:35,070
i like my make right I like my vinum in

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,030
my Emacs but right now I would

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,120
definitely encourage you to use the

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,620
ide there is certainly if you're more

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,360
advanced than you want some you know

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,310
pains and you want to solve the wrong

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,070
problem and you know do some yak shaving

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,820
by all means they're make files out

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,260
there go play but I do know that they're

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,090
working on making that tool chain way

00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,680
better so people can use the command

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:02,140
line oh that was important so when I

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,580
said to those open source many of you

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,660
are certainly familiar with open source

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,700
in this room or at least I certainly

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,840
hope so but you may be let you're more

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,450
familiar with on the open source

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,640
software side not the hardware side so

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,570
there is an open source hardware

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,580
definition now that happened out of the

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,010
last Maker Faire in New York which is

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,720
really a developer summit which is

00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,730
really cool stuff I'm not going to go

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,840
into that it's just FYI you probably

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,860
wanna check it out if you're really get

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,610
into this stuff just as a quick thanks

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,550
to our sponsors right awesome Scotch is

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,230
good so go download the eucalyptus stuff

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,240
and go register at open source com

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,790
thanks to the Scotch anyway there's a

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,620
whole bunch of different boards right

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,870
sorry do we know isn't just one thing

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,370
it's a bunch of stuff and I've got

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,410
examples some of you are you got to see

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,800
some of them others can come up after

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:53,560
the talk and take a look so the doing

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,220
the lenovo thing so kind of the flagship

00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,040
product is the arduino duemilanove a

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,540
except it's now that you know because

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,400
they change them to tech specs made a

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,500
bigger faster stronger and they changed

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,930
its name because we in America can't say

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,260
do a millon ovais and even i get close i

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,210
I butcher it so you know now so you'll

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:20,040
see both of those they're fairly

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:24,370
interchangeable until they're not so a

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,860
few places to get stuff right so there's

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,620
sparkfun there's a to fruit maker shed

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,990
shield list lots more places that i

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,640
could put here i'm kind of playing

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,990
favorites but i don't mean to i just

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,380
don't want to give you like this crazy

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,270
list so what Nathan Seidel does that

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,730
spark fun is all that really cool

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,500
surface mount technology stuff that most

00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,810
of you probably don't have surface mount

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,460
technology at home to deal with he puts

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,630
it on through hole or on headers and

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,700
shield so you can actually

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,170
you school accelerometers and stuff and

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,680
then they charges you quite a bit of

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,900
money even he admits that but it's cool

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,060
adafruit really makes school stuff I

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,650
actually invited lay dat to come to one

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,360
of my conferences right before she

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,800
became a rock star you may have seen her

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,030
on the cover of Wired magazine 2 issues

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,930
ago that was kind of weird and awesome

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,340
she's also the one who put out the

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,250
Kinect bounty to try to open source

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,540
Connect which is cool so lots of cool

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,450
stuff shield list is pretty interesting

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,250
so shield list is trying to catalog all

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,380
the really cool shields and what pins

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,620
they used because some shields as you

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,000
stack them up are using pins that are

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,250
already being used so you have to

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,260
reconfigure things or you just can't use

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,300
two shields together in any reasonable

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,950
way shield list kind of helps you sort

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,110
that stuff out so since this definitely

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,880
is a Linux conference I definitely want

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,520
to encourage everyone to try to go to

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,990
the wiki and install arduino stuff from

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,130
the instructions there and where they

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,470
don't work please try to fix them so the

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,900
Nano is small who woulda guessed the

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,920
mini is a little bigger lily pad is kind

00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:02,020
of a special niche it's for people who

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,780
are wanting to actually make like

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,250
wearable stuff right so one of the

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,440
common things that people are doing with

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,330
the Arduino in this space is building a

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,090
bike jacket that actually has blinkers

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:15,190
with soft circuits in the sleeves so as

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,380
you turn you just hit the soft circuit

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,360
on each sleeve and the blinker of LEDs

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,210
on the back just comes on right which is

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,650
really cool and so the idea is the lily

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,230
pad is kind of washable you know I mean

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,360
it's made to be more used in fabric so

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,440
you can get conductive thread not kunu I

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,990
didn't know that long ago that you could

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,860
get conductive thread in conductive you

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,330
know yarn and all kinds of cool stuff so

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,750
there's lots of cool stuff out there the

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,330
mega is obviously the big daddy lots

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,800
more CRO lots more I oh but the uno is

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,390
kind of like the flagship II product

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,630
that most people are using it's around

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,820
30 bucks and it's far the one you want

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,960
but as I said this stuff is open source

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,120
hardware so there's a guy not too far

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,000
from me that apologize that's not as

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,740
clear but anyway

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,510
that he does a lot of ockham programmers

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,100
in the room anyone program Ockham who so

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:15,160
occam is an old-school parallel

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,280
programming language and so he actually

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,320
wrote and built a new arduino to kind of

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,030
simulate multi-core stuff which is cool

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,820
call concurrency so if you're into that

00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,620
that's kind of cool now the project they

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,720
actually do is autonomous flight with an

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,500
Arduino as a summer project where you

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,440
control the plane using ockham and an

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,390
Arduino I didn't do cool stuff like that

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,220
in school but anyway so some of the

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,660
shield examples are Ethernet because

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,450
let's face it if something is it on the

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,790
internet it doesn't exist tellem eight

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,990
is an example of one that lets you do

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,020
composite out so you can actually put

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,550
you know text on the screen from text

00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,860
onto a TV screen you know using

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,510
composite video there's different motor

00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,620
shield you don't always need one but

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,510
depending on how many motors and what

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,310
kind of motor you have take a look at

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,020
the motor shields certainly it's nice to

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,790
know where you are GPS is good for that

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,170
breathalyzers because we always kind of

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,540
need to know how many scotches we had

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,060
things to the vendors last night

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,960
certainly there are custom-built shields

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,310
there's a front one up here called a

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,020
videogame shield at some friends of mine

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,140
from Pittsburgh made that lets you take

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,430
up some wii controllers the wii Chuck

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,740
controller hook them up and then do and

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,960
then also has video out and they have

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,730
some examples of like playing Tetris so

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,890
you can play Tetris on your TV with your

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,210
Arduino using wii controllers but then

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,300
you can expand that and do all kinds of

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,860
cool stuff so that's this is what the

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,300
telling nate looks like it just fits

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,690
right on top of your arduino and goes

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,450
out to your TV and this is hard stuff

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,920
right I mean this is how you print

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,020
something out to your screen once you

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,700
have just snap it on right and plug it

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,920
up serial.print hello world boom and it

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,530
goes right when i change this to hello

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,240
Benjamin my son's name he's seven he

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:05,260
flipped out right the TVs got his name

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,790
on it he was very excited and this is

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,090
straight from their example code URL at

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,500
the bottom but this is your normal

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,320
configuration and this is kind of

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,880
unfortunate right so the Arduino I have

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,180
to do a melonova instead the uno

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,100
should have changed the slide but so

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,540
with the Ethernet shield you're seeing

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,180
this correct this isn't some weird

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,520
optical illusion the Ethernet shield is

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,170
usually costing you way more than the

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,060
actual Arduino itself but never fear

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,130
because geeks are near right so people

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,960
are using DD work and it turns out that

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,460
a lot of the routers actually have

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,190
cereal on board that's never been used

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,760
so you pop them open and you get out

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,470
your soldering iron and yeah add some

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,390
cereal to it and off you go now you've

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,550
got a whole Linux box sitting there with

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,950
connected with an Arduino to do God

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,480
knows what you want to do some googling

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,130
may apply here and I would encourage it

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,970
because I haven't gotten a project at it

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,650
like this up yet but I'm very envious so

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,390
anyway another thing I highly highly

00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,980
recommend is when you're doing this

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,960
stuff if you're just hanging in one hour

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,850
dwie no off and you have no I oh go and

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,290
you're just kind of playing no biggie

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,300
you don't need a USB hub you're probably

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:18,070
gonna be safe but you can mess some

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,660
stuff up right and usually your

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,250
computers are kind of expensive unless

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,660
it's like mine it's like a hand-me-down

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,400
in five years old but um throw USB hub

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,680
between you and your Arduino and your

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,230
computer just to be safe I don't want

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,460
you coming back and going hey I did

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,450
something stupid and blew up my computer

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:39,190
I'm going to blame you don't do that so

00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,410
any old school Linux people that caught

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,640
their monitors on fire configuring x86

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,080
back in the day and I read the warning

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,110
and it terrified me but I never caught

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,700
my monitor on fire but anyway so a few

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,460
other projects that I kind of impo kit

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,310
on so I built a network testing thing

00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,110
for a guy kind of cloud related but it

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,840
wasn't really but it could have been so

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,740
we took rj45 Jack's right I'm up for

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,120
Ethernet pulled in there pulled in a

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,430
relay so that we could actually be Bob

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,680
tobacco guy right and break the physical

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,330
layer we're not nicely downing the

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,430
interface but we actually are breaking

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,650
the ethernet connection and testing the

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,530
system to see that things fail over and

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,650
do what you expect a power reset testing

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,760
as doing some methane gas testing

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,060
methane gas since you're testing stuff

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,750
and so we were constantly rebuilding the

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,550
code

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,500
the equipment and of course you had to

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,410
let the pots or see what the caps all

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,540
drain or you wouldn't really get the

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,990
system in a state that you would want so

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,820
waiting five seconds bored me so I wrote

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,740
a script to Preston you know when I

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,650
press the button it waits five seconds

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,420
before it brings us the system back up I

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,220
do a Halloween house tour in Pittsburgh

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,920
I've got some of that hardware up here

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,830
which is using in this case wave wave

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,320
shields there are augen vorbit or OGG

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,900
and mp3 available but they weren't at

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,250
the time when it did the project but

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,750
where I've been playing WAV files and

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:11,470
starting the wav file based on using a

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,510
doorbell I do a lot of toy whacking I'm

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,520
toying around with some of this DVD

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,470
database drivers for the internet of

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,970
things where you could do things like

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,800
you know select time and temperature

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,180
from North America where those results

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,830
are not coming from a database but

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,510
coming from actual internet devices

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:30,460
scattered out through the internet the

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:33,640
jQuery jQuery Mobile is really

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,170
interesting with rest we know so rest we

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,770
know lets you do stuff like this where

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:43,810
you load a rest sketch up onto your

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:47,080
Arduino some configuration will apply

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,550
but you can hit a URL and you get JSON

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,190
results back which is really cool

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,100
because then you can do stuff like you

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,230
know curl at your Arduino and get stuff

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,810
back and use stuff like Jace Jacob which

00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,140
is a json parser to get out specific

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,020
bits of JSON that you want cool stuff

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,130
jquery mobile so to carry the

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,800
potentiometer servomotor a little bit

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,600
further so jQuery Mobile let's give a

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,910
slider you scale your slider from zero

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,760
to one hundred and seventy-nine you can

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,120
replace the pot in there and then now

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,640
your wireless controlling your servo and

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,350
it's easy mostly but it's pretty darn

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,140
easy which is really cool it doesn't

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:31,090
work on my g1 which sucks but works on

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,800
my phone which is cool anyway I so when

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,030
you learn Linux right you you learn that

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,190
you want to script your problems away

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,080
right you know small shell scripts to

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,210
replace people and things right so I

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,100
have one of these right you may have one

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,750
too and I have

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,850
few of these you may or may not have

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,380
some of these but with the problem when

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,799
you have one of these and two of these

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,510
is they believe the doors open a lot so

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,400
now I'm actually building a system for

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,870
my basement doors to alert me if both of

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,299
my basement doors are open at the same

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,530
time because there's that the basement

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,179
door going into the basement in the

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,860
basement door going to the outside and

00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:05,230
it's summer so they're often both open

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:09,910
now the cat has a aggress which is not

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:11,559
good so this is getting into a bigger

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,150
project of building in a whole Arduino

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,750
based alarm system for my house but

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:19,390
anyway that's kind of cool stuff alright

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,880
so let's going to do a few code things

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,400
and explanations so I've mentioned

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,600
already that programs are sketches but

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
may you might have caught that so

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,110
programs in our in Arduino land our

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,030
sketches sketches why so any processing

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,400
people anybody hacking on processing

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,720
processing dorg so processing is another

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,880
project you probably check out it's

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,549
really cool if you're into graphics but

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,720
they stole the IDE or borrowed or forked

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:48,460
or however you want to think about it

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,200
code we used the IDE from processing and

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,640
in processing it's a graphical

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,520
environment and you're focused on

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,059
drawing things so there were sketches so

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,470
your programs became sketches no big

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:03,039
deal just you'll see it and you'll

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,510
wonder why so there's two functions that

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,080
are important when you do your Arduino

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,419
their setup and loop and I'm setup is

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,890
just what your pin assignments are what

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,990
your bod rates are for your cereal

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,990
whatever things you need to set up for

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,630
your sketch to run and then loop just

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,520
runs forever so you can you know think

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,590
of main surrounding both of those are

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,240
assuming main kind of being your loop

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:31,059
sort of so the basic blinking light is

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,590
your you know kind of hello world you

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:35,980
know you've got it blinking and for me

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,340
when I realized Arduino was special was

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,080
when I was fixing ramen noodles and I

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,760
already had my arduino hooked up had the

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,419
IDE installed you know right so it's all

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,010
there but I dropped the the noodles into

00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,799
the boiling water and went back to my

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,159
dining table and downloaded the sketch

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,480
and it was blinken and I tweaked the

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,270
code made it blink faster

00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,010
slower and added a button like this is

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,660
really cool and then the 3-minute timer

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:06,180
went off telling me my ramen noodles

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:09,250
were done and I'm like okay this is cool

00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,770
so anyway so this is the the blink

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:15,400
sketch that is from the examples right

00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:20,260
so you'll see that standard comment

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,150
notation for C++ you can do you know the

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,130
style or single multi-line style or

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,690
single line style we're going to set up

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,450
we're going to say pin number 13 is it

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,980
output pin and then we're going to loop

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,290
forever we're going to digitally right

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,300
to pin 13 we're going to raise it high

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,390
so it comes on we're going to wait for a

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,130
while we're going to take it low who off

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,030
it goes we're going to lay for a while

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,880
and we're just going to keep going

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,190
forever or no just start blinking an LED

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,740
at us and well a lot of people are like

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,660
whew with LED well once you realize that

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,820
the LED is just a proxy for anything

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,670
else you want to turn on and off then it

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,340
gets to be a lot more interesting so you

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,270
know there you go and again i forgot

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,420
that i actually made the code a little

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,570
more readable but okay you broke it out

00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:07,000
for you so fermata is an abstraction

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,590
similar to MIDI a little bit i'm not a

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,180
MIDI guys so I'm kind of faking that a

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,410
little bit Georgia dating what I've been

00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,060
told anyway there's applications this

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,870
one was obviously from my mac but

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:22,330
there's others that just give you a

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:25,600
quick interface and when you run for the

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,100
fermata sketch on the Arduino you can go

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,960
and tweak all this stuff and so now you

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,700
have a pretty fast way to start hacking

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,930
at your stuff and not even have to write

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,980
a whole lot of code so you can be

00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,100
testing more at the hardware level

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,390
rather than the Arduino level and it

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,690
makes sense for your project what you're

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,840
doing where can you do the debugging and

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:46,360
whatnot but anyway so for the Pearl

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,050
world there's device fermata so now I

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,810
want to actually bring something up and

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,310
down so I've there's the fermata sketch

00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,190
that would be downloaded to the Arduino

00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:59,380
then I run this program which would

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,120
basically blink and I hope it makes

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,420
sense to everybody why the LED would

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,830
blink it's unfortunately not on Sipan

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,800
but it is on github which is the next

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:13,000
best thing and maybe even better

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,530
so you can check that out so there's a

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,510
few ways that you can connect i'm going

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:20,680
to show you too but there's more but

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:24,550
we're going to do serial internet so

00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,550
we're going to do a blink / cereal right

00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,560
so this is kind of this is not this is

00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,850
very important right you want to make

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,360
sure that you're getting your bod rate

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,860
set up correctly so this is on your

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,910
Arduino side what you're going to say

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,810
hey pin 13 is the interesting pin here

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,460
we're just going to go ahead and tell us

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,260
an output pin we're going to wait for

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,120
cereal is available if we see a one

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,740
we're going to come high and turn it on

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm just doing some debugging here so

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,600
we'll see it and the serial monitor in

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,790
the arduino ide and yes the Arduino

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,440
monitor from the IDE could certainly be

00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,720
extreme or anything else that you want

00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,420
to read from actually you scream but a

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,740
lot but anyway on and then digitalwrite

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:10,150
load you turn it back off and we delay

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,490
and so now we're blinking over cereal if

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,440
we're good stuff so the quick loop so

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,830
the first quick way to test that is from

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,170
the Arduino monitor and this is within

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,180
the Arduino IDE so you get this little

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,620
thing and this is where the ba great

00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,660
stuff matters right so you want to make

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,630
sure this matches up to what you told

00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,130
the Arduino to work at but you put this

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,390
is your input box and you send it to the

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,610
Arduino and this is the results the

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,320
guard we know sends you pretty simple

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,330
stuff I mean any terminal will work but

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,010
the serial monitor is just there in the

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:43,510
IDE and you're already there anyway hack

00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:46,000
on so it's handy so I it's pearl right

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,330
so you can all this stuff up to the

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,830
break is just kind of cargo a cult set

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,470
up the serial connection this is the

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:56,140
important part right one whew we made

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,600
the LED come on and we could obviously

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,260
loop around and do that more to make it

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,090
actually blink so one of the examples

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,760
are one of the things that work on at

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,710
home is a happy loop because I like to

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,710
be happy doesn't often happen I like to

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,180
be happy so so one of things that makes

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,190
me sad is going to lose my keys right

00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,200
we've all lost our keys so we definitely

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:21,310
have to have you know scripts to help us

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,210
with that so but I can fix that with an

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,880
Arduino

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,410
and a little bit of programming right so

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,390
little pearl coat always helps you out

00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:33,910
so whatever you want applies here right

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:38,020
I'm using it a test framework within

00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:40,420
pearl to do this so basically i'm using

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,790
a package called test them to mechanize

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,980
to hit our URLs that i will get off the

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:48,220
command line and then I'm looking for

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,650
text that says my keys are home my keys

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,260
are not home but I'm also going to check

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:56,320
first to see well should my keys even be

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,580
home right and you can hand wave and how

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,390
you want to do that but maybe you're

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,820
going to check your Google Calendar

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,830
through the Google API because you keep

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,230
you know your schedule up to date and it

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,250
knows your work so your Kings aren't

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:11,470
supposed to be at home you're at work

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,970
right anyway the way I'm kind of doing

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,560
is setting it up the real version at

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,600
home is where it could actually snooze

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,550
as well right so don't nag me about this

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,880
for another 30 minutes because I'm at

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:24,190
the bar drinking scotch so anyway so

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,350
that you can run this with approved

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:29,500
command or other stuff but the proof is

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:32,140
pretty good this is just the Pearl

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,090
testing framework stuff so anything up

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,910
to the dot dot are arguments to prove

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,100
anything after the dot dot are arguments

00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:42,490
to the script that's being run which is

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,950
a really cool little thing in Perl if

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,870
you like the testing framework and so

00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,670
you get results back like this so my

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,440
keys are not home when it just is a text

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,260
comparison that says hey the keys are

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,820
not home look at that and then if it

00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,210
worked in the keys are home you get

00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,820
output like this and of course the exit

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,050
values are true and false so you can

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,940
actually you know pipe these things

00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:08,800
along in the command line and do

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:11,260
whatever you want in she'll put it in

00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,120
cron you know whatever that little thing

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:18,040
is called the heirs datel which who knew

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,080
anyway so we guard we know code on that

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,560
so they have a web server example right

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,040
in the IDE it's it's creatively enough

00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,630
called web server and all this is just

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,550
kind of setting up your connection again

00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,100
cargo cult be stuff open actually have

00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,470
this a different slide with color coding

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,010
that makes it harder to read we'll go

00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,940
back

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:42,280
alright so you definitely need to tweak

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,590
the IP number if you're running multiple

00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,000
arduino 'he's on your network you

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:49,990
definitely want to tweak the mac address

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,860
as well so just remember that it's not

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,480
like I've ever forgotten to do that what

00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,330
port you're going to be writing your web

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,070
server on and the rest of this you're

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,600
really not going to probably touch in

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,720
down here you're really not going to

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,220
touch but this little part in the middle

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,950
by default it's going to iterate through

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,510
your analog connections and tell you

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:15,520
what the readings are and dump it out to

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,570
your you know as a web page so that's

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,780
the little bit we're going to fiddle

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:22,450
with and we're going to inject this

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,130
we're going to read the button state of

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,560
a particular button tin which I guess I

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,700
should have good an assignment to and

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,350
we're going to say that we know where

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,080
the keys are are we don't based on the

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,320
button state and so then you can hit it

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,150
with a web server or a web browser it

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,560
says hey I know where the keys are hey I

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,180
don't know where the keys are or

00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:46,030
whatever and that's really bad but I

00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,230
just have two little conductors sticking

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,170
out there where I could hang a metal

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,580
keyring so my keys are there which I

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,800
have a blacksmith making me something

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:59,740
more attractive because what I have is

00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:01,840
not life friendly so yeah that's

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,550
unfortunate alright so another problem

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,970
I've absolves I'm pretty happy with is

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:08,590
my doorbell so one of my problems i have

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,510
is i live in a really cool neighborhood

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,950
in the city of Pittsburgh and I have

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,110
lots of really cool neighbors and I'm

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,640
seldom home and then I get packages

00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:20,920
delivered because I ordered cool stuff

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:24,340
and I wasn't home to get it so I fixed

00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:27,700
that with the script so now when you

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:33,000
ring my doorbell it will actually send

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:35,530
me a text message so in this case I am

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,480
this is just a little stupid parole side

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,340
of things right it doesn't really matter

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,480
how I send code on the purl side I'm

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,480
sure you can all send email

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,720
but on the Arduino side now I have to we

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,820
had C++ right so I need to give a

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,890
signature declaration void I need now to

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,010
IP numbers because I need the IP number

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,080
of the Arduino itself and the web server

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,640
that I'm going to hit and then I also

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,650
need to know what port I'm going to hit

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,400
on that web server oops real quick

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:13,050
instead then we're going to set up the

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,850
connection and we're going to loop

00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,160
forever and we're just going to read and

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,530
it's pretty much what you saw before but

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,030
now with the keys but now we're actually

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:27,540
going to be a web client and hit a web

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:31,980
server which is done in the function

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:34,370
ding dong which is just very simple i

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,910
run a little script that tells me hey

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:43,910
someone's at my door which is cool

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:47,540
that's the little thing i built for

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,530
testing the network so that's the rj45

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,020
Ethernet wired up with the relay in the

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,370
middle what's your school stuff to know

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,690
like I didn't even know these things

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,690
were so handy until I started poking

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,040
around and that was the relay so a

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,690
couple other things there's patchbay

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,950
once you get rocking and rolling with

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,300
this stuff you'll maybe you have a

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,920
logging application that you want to

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,200
start logging data to and have some cool

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,060
stuff you want to log weather wherever

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,740
you are and share open data with the

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:15,180
world patchbay can help you do that

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:19,590
there's also things speak which is kinda

00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,820
like Facebook for your devices so for

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,080
some friends of mine from IO bridge

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,880
started this which is a really cool

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,950
thing so really what I should have been

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,020
using and the doorbell example is let

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,480
things speak actually have sent my email

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:35,010
which is cool which I'll pipe week later

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,390
but that's worth checking out so these

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:40,500
other stuff one of the things that

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,880
really has me excited right now is and I

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,220
kind of alluded to that with the whole

00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,600
jquery mobile with having these

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,690
touchscreen interfaces that you can

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,190
interface with something like on arduino

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:53,460
there's a there's an iphone application

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:56,190
called wow peas which it's not very well

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,320
but it's kind of useful and all it does

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:03,019
is it maps

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:04,820
it gives you a basic keypad like this

00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:07,100
that you can assign whatever kind of

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,299
graphics you want to any of these

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,460
buttons you can't rearrange these

00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,559
buttons or anything but buttons are

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,179
where they are but what you do is you

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,559
assign images to that and it can be from

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:19,100
the stock images or it can be your own

00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:22,940
images and then you do the mac pc thing

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,220
which is line endings of course fill it

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,289
what port and what IP number to hit and

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:31,519
you assign a bit of texts to each one of

00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:33,289
those buttons and it will then send that

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,070
text over so now you have a touchscreen

00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:39,259
interface into your Arduino which is

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,850
pretty cool so one of the projects I

00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:44,360
have is to actually take that idea and

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,580
redo it with jquery mobile so it's a web

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:53,990
touchscreen thing so it's like wow

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:55,730
jQuery Mobile keys so what everybody

00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,009
familiar with this graph anyway not know

00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,690
this right so some people here may not

00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:04,159
like Microsoft and I think this is

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:06,409
partly why right so obviously the bomber

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,970
curve here is indicating that everyone's

00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:13,330
blood alcohol concentration just

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:15,950
programming skill level is the same no I

00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,240
highly doubt that right some people need

00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,580
a little more scotch to write better

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,450
code some people don't need any Scotch

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:26,720
to write code right so we can fix that

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:30,710
with Arduino right so a friend of mine

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,750
wrote a made a breathalyzer shield so

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:36,889
you can actually get a blood alcohol

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,779
sort of you know it's all relative right

00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:42,340
but you can get a reading of your

00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:46,909
intoxicant toxicity how drunk you are

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,730
I'm not which is cool right so you get

00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:52,879
one of these so clearly you have a

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:55,309
breathalyzer shield and Arduino some git

00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:57,379
commit hooks and then you know you can

00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,940
get some better code right because if

00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:01,039
you're on a really good project you have

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,590
a good testing framework right so you

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,299
know whether or not the commits actually

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,210
broke a bunch of stuff because you're

00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:10,519
doing continuous integration right and

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,750
if it was too bad and you logged that

00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,320
way

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,520
the blood alcohol reading then

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,670
eventually you just start rejecting

00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:22,840
commits just based completely on blood

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:26,410
alcohol right so anyway I think that's

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,540
uh yeah I think that would be fun anyway

00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:33,370
so who has questions comments projects

00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:40,960
who's doing cool stuff Thing Thing Thing

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:42,670
speak yep nobody it was all it was all

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,560
perfectly clear to everyone you're all

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:57,120
going to go order your own Arduino zand

00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:57,120
change the world yeah yeah

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,649
so so here's what I'm saying you're

00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:39,240
saying middle schoolers can program c++

00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:41,190
and do physical computing and it's

00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:55,829
easier than programming python is that

00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:58,349
what I just heard no no yeah but I mean

00:34:55,829 --> 00:35:06,960
they are coding c++ right which is

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:08,670
really cool yeah yeah that's cool so I

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,589
had this dream as i mentioned i'm trying

00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,750
to start we're starting up a maker faire

00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:14,069
and Pittsburgh so after that ordering

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,430
that I'm going to try to Genesis a

00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:20,640
project to teach every kid in Pittsburgh

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,920
not me personally put Arduinos right and

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,599
while I certainly am NOT misguided

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,910
enough to think that every kid is going

00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,980
to take their little Arduino and live

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,910
forever and be happy a lot of them are

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,520
gonna think it's the dumbest thing in

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,990
the world I didn't get that but just

00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,280
that kind of exposure i think it's going

00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,020
to be pretty exciting a lot of kids

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:43,770
think football is stupid too but we make

00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:44,940
them play it so come on anyway i have a

00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,650
whole bunch of show-and-tell stuff i

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,650
have books you can take a look at yeah

00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:57,049
i'm going to definitely go with yes

00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:08,760
can so what I'm hearing is can evil be

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:10,890
done with an Arduino yes no I I don't

00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:23,760
know specifically but I'm going to go

00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:26,760
with yes right it's cool stuff yeah no

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:31,140
no I mean no it's compiled with GCC and

00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:35,880
sent over you know for at metal code

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:38,460
it's a microcontroller it's a it's a at

00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:43,890
twice the latest one it's it it's an

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:46,730
atmel this is where I fall down yeah

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,730
it's AV archtop

00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:55,279
yeah I forget the numbers so I honestly

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,529
try very hard not to pay attention

00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,240
because it doesn't really matter to me

00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:01,160
like once I bump up against the problem

00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,279
with it I'll just add another one

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,990
because the projects I do I'm not going

00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:08,119
to go put maybe something will change

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,670
right but to the projects I do I don't

00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,230
put the Arduino off in isolation he's

00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,450
got access to the Internet he's got

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,619
access to stuff right he'll have a DD

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,420
Wharton sitting there he'll have

00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:19,549
something right I'm not too worried

00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,279
about overburden and a little Arduino

00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:25,069
because if I'm probably doing it wrong

00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:30,220
and in the way I do things if I've

00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:32,690
burden the Arduino too much yeah oh

00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,430
absolutely there's wife is Wi-Fi shield

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,559
is Bluetooth there's Wi-Fi dear

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,329
cellphone blues all kinds of stuff so

00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,950
the cell phone stuff is cool right you

00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:44,299
want to do data logging of something

00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:47,299
somewhere so monitoring temperature of a

00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:50,450
river or flow over ever or whatever and

00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:58,960
just use the cell like this SIM card put

00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:58,960
it in the shield that's good stuff yeah

00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,020
they can't be

00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:19,230
absolutely so there's actually a guy I

00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,810
was talking to a texas linux fest who is

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,640
what their maker one of them I think

00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:26,670
they have to hacker spaces in Austin he

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,230
was with one of them so he's it's open

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,380
source hardware right so he's actually

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:33,060
going to get the Arduino unos at about

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,970
him I think he said a 17 dollar price

00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,680
point for those but I mean these

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,900
actually board inos right that you can

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,330
make where you can just basically build

00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,849
it on a breadboard you know for sub ten

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,920
dollars right i mean the chip itself I

00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:51,960
think is five if you just buy the chip

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,640
itself so I mean there are so in I mean

00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:59,609
the brains are in the chip and the rest

00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,839
is just supporting stuff come on people

00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:03,240
are doing cool stuff what do you want to

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:13,770
do you want to come look at something

00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:15,150
there's stuff up here yeah there is a I

00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,859
can't think of the name of it at the

00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:24,260
moment but there's you know the four you

00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:27,470
had the pod copper so you slide with him

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,470
there you go

00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,110
you

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,089
that's awesome

00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:42,409
yeah yeah yeahs one of the things that

00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:44,059
has attracted me to arduino it is a lot

00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:45,859
of the culture I mean a lot of the

00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:47,059
microchip and the pic type folks they

00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,159
look at your circuit and they're like

00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:50,869
whoa your things blinken but you didn't

00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,819
put a resistor in there you're going to

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,359
burn out your LED and they're really

00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:58,489
looking at it from an eecs purist side

00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:00,439
of the world where the Arduino community

00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:03,439
is more embracing like hey awesome you

00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:04,909
got it going let's let's keep going

00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:07,039
right I was on the mailing list and

00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:08,779
there's like this great discussion going

00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,719
on about what they probably want to deal

00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:13,699
with string processing right because it

00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,259
kind of sucks in C right and then when

00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:16,939
you've got an artist who knows really

00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:18,859
nothing about Knoll termination or this

00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:20,509
stuff right and they want to go grab a

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:22,640
twitter feed and slam it into some

00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:24,319
project and do something and now they're

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,869
fighting with you know all kinds of

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,619
weird stuff that they don't understand

00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:30,939
so they're trying to figure out how to

00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:34,009
make a better string processing library

00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:35,329
that's small enough to fit on the

00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:36,919
Arduino but they don't want to put it in

00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:39,079
cork is not everybody's going to do it

00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:41,150
and then where does it go to probably

00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,029
the ethernet library but maybe not so

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,799
anyway there's all this usability at the

00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:47,119
programming level for the Arduino that

00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:55,509
they're really trying to make it

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:55,509
friendly which I think awesome yeah

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,920
nice

00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:23,229
so I haven't looked at much what google

00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,670
announced at Google i/o with Android and

00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:26,859
Arduino have you looked at that yet to

00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:31,839
see what's there like should I be

00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:35,579
excited or is it all that much okay yeah

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,579
yeah yeah

00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:59,739
so it'll be a little scratched like yeah

00:42:53,249 --> 00:43:03,549
yeah awesome so for those of you didn't

00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:06,509
catch that our google i/o at Google i/o

00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:10,660
they released what they call it via the

00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:13,959
Android Arduino dev kit or something

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:17,019
anyway there's some kind of yeah it's

00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:18,549
some kind of Arduino Android love right

00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:20,019
and so they're working with the app

00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:22,900
inventor stuff so you can do the whole

00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:24,849
drag and drop for make it android apps

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,549
with your that work with Arduino which

00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:28,779
is kind of cool terrific we would be

00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:31,989
interesting for kids because it's

00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:33,279
supposed to be scratched like so and

00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:38,189
there's a lot of kid programming things

00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:38,189
based on a mighty scratch anything else

00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:42,669
come on I drug stuff here from

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,640
Pittsburgh for you folks I mean come on

00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:46,839
come I know it's the end of the day but

00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,089
feel free to take a look at some of it

00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:53,650
but it depends what I'm doing I mean I

00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:57,819
literally do buy a lot of my stuff from

00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:59,650
sparkfun I like Lady ADA maker shed I

00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:00,939
appreciate them because of their

00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,959
relationship with make and what they're

00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:04,179
trying to do in the community but I

00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:11,769
honest with feel or charge a little more

00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:14,249
than they need to be right but what I

00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:18,179
really wanted to make her shed to be was

00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:18,179
so I really were to make

00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:59,070
what about this I can help the like it

00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:01,640
we have the same problem or whatever a

00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,640
few years

00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:09,040
that's not the word out

00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,040
you

00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,840
you

00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:23,600
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,190
all we do is hosted computing to us the

00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,140
cloud is just the next generation of

00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,090
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,040
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,210
we're in a unique position to really

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,340
help bring these two worlds together

00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,650
these different sets of technologies and

00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,990
to help companies embrace this new world

00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:41,000
in this great new tool that allows

00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:43,580
faster innovation not only is it about

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,620
us being responsive and accountable but

00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:51,350
it's about us doing more for you whether

00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:55,370
less an OS that works the way that you

00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:59,530
