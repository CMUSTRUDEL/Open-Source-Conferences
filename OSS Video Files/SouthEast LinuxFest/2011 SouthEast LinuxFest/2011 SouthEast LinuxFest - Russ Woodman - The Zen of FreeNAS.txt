the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,870
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370

linux fest org the southeast linux fest

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,740
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,740
for helping make these videos possible

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,090
I guess so

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:32,130
rough wood women are k 5 is co-chairman

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,930
the president of blue-collar event

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,200
foundation system administrator for

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:48,990
necto communication he is also cold

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:50,159
linux in the hands okay as you will

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,860
probably know i'm going to be talking

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,200
today about freenas and my first

00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:01,950
question is how many people have like

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,979
experts in freenas good because if you

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,509
were this is going to be very

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:11,940
kindergarten so let me let me try to get

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,790
a sense of what people know about

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,380
freenas from from the perspective of

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,340
what it does not what it is who here

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:29,329
would like to tell me what they think

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:31,709
freenas is good okay well what's Nast

00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:43,950
okay so what would you do with your

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:49,650
nasir ver okay back up as I heard file

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:54,709
server hi scuzzy okay anything else NFS

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:59,790
okay that's good Samba CFS anything else

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:04,069
I'm sorry host VMs yep okay well that's

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,810
about six percent of what freenas can do

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,389
so it's a very versatile product and one

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,190
thing is if anybody was in here for the

00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,200
last talk the dan was giving about linux

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,519
from scratch one thing i will say about

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,730
freenas is that it is philosophically

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:25,170
the entirely the opposite it is designed

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,239
to make bsd and the operating system

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:32,330
behind freenas completely invisible so

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:35,980
you're nothing about it now you can

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:39,019
because it is bsd freebsd in fact

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,569
get into its internals and you could

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,019
even make a full-blown freebsd server

00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:49,160
out of it but that is entirely not its

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:52,310
purpose it's basically set up to be

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,019
network attached storage basically every

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,319
kind of network attached storage you can

00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:59,239
imagine so what I'm going to start off

00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,860
with I don't have any slides for this I

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,569
just wanted to hopefully show everything

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,870
live like it would happen on your own

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:11,090
freenas box so the first thing you'll

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,739
notice is that I'm using a virtual

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:20,720
machine and I'm going to install freenas

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:22,400
on my laptop and then use it as if it

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,960
were a computer out on the web somewhere

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:31,130
or in your server farm or whatever the

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,380
download size you can see right here 125

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,870
Meg's so if you wanted to burn an iso of

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,419
it to install that's how big it is

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:44,120
pretty small you can actually run it as

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:47,030
a fully functioning server right from

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,650
the CD it's a live CD but for

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,510
performance reasons I would recommend

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,310
that you install it I mean it's so small

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,120
you can do it in a virtual machine

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:58,370
environment just like this I have it set

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,020
for 256 megs of ram doesn't meet

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,370
anywhere near that video memory is

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,900
irrelevant because once you have it

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,880
installed it basically just sits in the

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,979
background and you never really worry

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,260
about it again you just worry about how

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:20,740
you see the storage from all your other

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:20,740
devices so this is an install of freenas

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,310
and this will probably be the fastest

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,720
install of anything you've ever seen

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:35,720
that was larger than an application and

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,190
hopefully it's not hopefully it plays

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,570
out that way and we're not all sitting

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,300
here yawning waiting for this thing to

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,700
install I do have a backup of a live

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,200
server that I can get to if I need to

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,490
and this this one right here that i have

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,810
in this web browser which is what you're

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,420
going to see eventually when this all

00:05:50,810 --> 00:06:02,270
comes back up is my live one of my live

00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:04,190
freenas servers back at home so I am I'm

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:09,880
just booting this like was said before

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:13,100
in the previous talk open sorry

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,440
virtualbox thank you virtual box allows

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,570
you to run an ISO as if it were a CD or

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,310
dvd straight from the file so you don't

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,270
have to burn it and all that waste all

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,300
your time with that okay so here we go

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll go ahead and select boot and now I

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,720
could just run this like this and

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,669
freenas would be up and running no

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,580
problems but I'm actually going to do

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,520
and installed just so you can see how

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,690
quick it goes and i would recommend that

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,310
if you're going to run a freenas server

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,810
whether it's in the vm environment or if

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,510
you're going to have your own box you do

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,590
the install you're not going to be

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,590
wasting much of your time

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,050
you can pre configure and inside the GUI

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,370
which I guess I'll get to it now was

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,979
going to get to later but inside the GUI

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,479
you can actually download the xml file

00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,550
so that if you build another server you

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,330
can re-upload it and it will reconfigure

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:13,880
all your settings automatically so

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:20,310
option number 9 up there is install

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:22,979
we'll do a full install from the CD to

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,430
the hard drive let it pick all its

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,900
defaults don't need a swap partition and

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:35,400
in about a minute we'll have a freenas

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:37,860
server you'll see that this is bsd

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,039
underneath you're looking at bsd type

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,120
drive lettering drive numbering have a

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,010
TA dr0 slice one uses slices instead of

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,889
you know the partitions and stuff like

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,150
that but the nomenclature is pretty

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,070
straightforward and of course once this

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,400
actually installs you'll never see this

00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:00,870
stuff again well I take that back you

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,570
will but it's easy this actually tells

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,440
you how when you're free NASA server

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,539
comes up to configure your disk inside

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,710
of freenas so you don't even have to

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,940
know how to do that it tells you how to

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,650
do it so you can just copy this into a

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,750
text document or whatever and have it

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:24,410
for when you reboot the install is done

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,410
by the way so I'm going to reboot

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,570
actually I'm going to shut down

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,580
and then I'm going to turn off the CD

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:48,950
ROM so we actually boot into the live

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:50,120
system okay it's down so now I'm just

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,250
going to go into the storage and

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:59,209
virtualbox turn off the freenas disk

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:07,480
give us no boot disk start it back up

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:13,330
again now this should be really fast

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,330
we'll see make a liar out of me

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:51,050
okay you now have a live freenas server

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:53,570
that's all there is to it I have I have

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,550
this set to host only networking because

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,640
I want to be able to access this virtual

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:02,690
machine from my laptop so all you have

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:07,790
to do to configure that is make sure

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:12,440
this is set here to host only and in

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:18,470
here set your lan IP with dhcp we don't

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:25,040
need to turn on ipv6 for this you'll get

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:32,959
a dhcp address from VirtualBox 192 168

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:37,850
56 101 where's my to get unlock my

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:43,010
cursor so I go to that address in the

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,390
web browser 56 101 there's the free now

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,800
server i just installed and you can see

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,550
it looks exactly the same as the other

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,089
one so now we log into it and the

00:10:49,550 --> 00:11:01,180
defaults are admin and freenas to get

00:10:53,089 --> 00:11:01,180
into it all lowercase I hope

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,560
there we go so here's what you see and

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,120
now the rest of the the rest of freenas

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,520
is driven entirely from this beauty

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,370
interface to make everything super

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:21,600
simple what you're actually looking at

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:24,540
here is the status and system from this

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,950
drop-down so the first thing you

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,680
probably want to do is do some basic

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,060
configuration on your system oh and by

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,640
the way as far as what services who

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:37,470
provides its these and it's not only a

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,520
server for these but it's also a client

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:43,710
for some so if you want to link for

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,750
example to freenas servers together by

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:50,180
our sink so that they make copies of

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:52,980
each other you can do that you can have

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,510
you can create a nice cozy target in

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,290
other words you can have a device

00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:01,170
connect to this via I scuzzy or you can

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,620
have this server connect to another sand

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:09,300
device via I scuzzy and provide your

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:15,060
devices with storage by proxy through

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:18,870
freenas so one of the first things you

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,350
probably want to do is go to the general

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,060
setup this is pretty straightforward

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,050
stuff you may want to change your

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:31,470
hostname your domain name you may want

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,360
to set static IP addressing which by the

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,810
way isn't necessary because this also

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,340
supports dynamic dns so if you don't

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,600
happen to have a static IP address or

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,390
don't want to spend the money aren't or

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,220
don't have any way to get one you can

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,980
still put this out on the internet using

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:52,710
guy dns org or whatever and always have

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:54,960
access to it if you don't want your pet

00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,900
or your username for the web GUI to be

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,110
admin you can change it here you can

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,550
make this encrypted automatically

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,190
generate certs and everything and of

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,630
course if you have your own key and

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:13,370
certificate you can just cut and paste

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:13,370
them here customize your port etc

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:22,440
change your timezone at sports in tpe of

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:24,510
course click on save and where you go

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,280
and then this is where you change the

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,390
password for your admin GUI if you also

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,940
want to do that which I definitely

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,320
recommend because as you all know

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:37,980
freenas is a default and if you leave it

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:39,960
that way you will be hacked there's a

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,470
lot of stuff you can configure under

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:46,950
your system and advanced things that you

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:50,370
may want to set up immediately are away

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:52,950
for free nasty email you because you can

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:57,810
set it up to send you reports about its

00:13:52,950 --> 00:14:01,080
local devices how much utilization

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,630
that's getting all kinds of stuff which

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,080
we'll get to a little bit later but you

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,670
know you put in your information here

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:19,440
give it a test and I guess I could just

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:21,060
set mine up here free NASA local make it

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,110
secure since we're on the wireless

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,110
network in a conference

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:44,970
for best available and it fails I don't

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,189
know why probably because it doesn't

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,989
like one of my savings but anyway you

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,579
just test it when you get a little green

00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,829
thing up there you're good to go and

00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:57,229
then any other settings later on that

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,229
require email are already taken care of

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:03,749
now the next thing you have to do is set

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:06,059
up the storage because you want this box

00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,709
to be able to serve files or store files

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:13,470
or whatever it is you want to do with

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:16,859
this so you go into the management and

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,569
the first thing that he's the first

00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:21,119
thing that bugged me about freenas when

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:22,470
I did it myself for the first time was

00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:25,709
wondering what I'm supposed to do at

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:29,369
this point the little plus way over on

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:32,789
the right-hand side is not really in

00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:35,249
your face and there's really nothing

00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:43,709
else you can do on this screen but once

00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:44,849
you find the plus then so some of some

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,229
of the you know the configuration things

00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:48,089
are just really subtle for no particular

00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:50,399
reason you know there isn't like a nice

00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:55,709
big button that says add disk you know

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:59,399
click here something like that but so in

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:06,959
this case we only have one disk so we'll

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:08,609
call it free mass storage and we won't

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,759
turn smart on or any of that stuff you

00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:14,759
can see all the options you have here go

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,720
ahead and add it and then it says you

00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:21,179
must apply apply and now we have a disk

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:27,029
and this disk can be used to store or

00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:30,059
certain files from but this is the whole

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:33,419
disk including the part of the bit that

00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,129
has freenas on it so we actually want to

00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:36,269
make a partition which is what we did

00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,249
during the install there were two

00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:41,549
partitions one has freenas and the other

00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:45,119
sort of your blank storage and we want

00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:48,600
to assign that now so you go to your

00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:55,169
mount point and again there's a little

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,819
plus over here on the right and remember

00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:58,739
when I said it told you how to set up

00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:00,720
this partition when you did the install

00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:04,079
well this is the bit where you use that

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,049
knowledge so you pick the disk and of

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,259
course there's only one it told you to

00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,269
use the MBR partition and it was

00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:13,829
partition number two now it won't let

00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,509
you use partition number one because

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,299
that's where freenas is and it will say

00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:21,589
I can't override myself so you don't

00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:28,470
have to worry about that but used to

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:30,330
we'll call it data we don't really want

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,159
to mount it read only because we

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,460
probably want to store things on this

00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,580
drive it makes the system a little more

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:42,600
usable and I'm going to set this to

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,519
nobody and no group just so that all the

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,850
files that are stored in this partition

00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:54,659
are away from the operating system users

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:58,559
and so forth so we'll add it and you

00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:01,369
have to apply this is there's an error

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,369
why is there air

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:13,190
that's not happening before oh now it's

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:15,380
good okay live demo obviously so and of

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,420
course you can f sick this drive if you

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,260
want to and if your system had more than

00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:24,430
one drive you'd be able to act yes did

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,440
you oh I'm sorry so I hand was like okay

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:31,640
so you can check your drive make sure

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,800
it's consistency is good you can also

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,500
unmount any drives you don't need or are

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,500
going to service or whatever but at this

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:45,650
yes yes this will actually handle

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,950
software raid right here under disks and

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,630
software raid and you know once you have

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,940
once you have two disks with partitions

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:56,420
on them that you've predefined you can

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,310
assign them into a raid 0 15 or any of

00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,950
those configurations there and that will

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:06,080
handle all the software raid for you and

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:09,800
I think it says it even does lvm don't

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,180
remember if it does ovm or not haven't

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,760
done that myself in fact I haven't even

00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:17,600
used the software raid it also as you

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,220
can see here supports ZF z FS pools so

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,680
if you're familiar with ZFS and you like

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:28,000
pooling using ZFS it supports that as

00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,000
well yes

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,070
the question was about the size of disk

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,900
partitions the freenas can handle and

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm not sure in what way you mean that

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,820
it can't handle a partitioner

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,460
yeah I don't I'm not aware of any

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,830
limitations in it and also this is

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,539
version 7 of freenas which is the

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,450
version I happen to use and be familiar

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:47,830
with but version 8 has recently come out

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:52,110
so anything that this lacks version 8

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,110
may even support so yes

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,929
if the freebsd kernel supports that has

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:16,340
a driver for that device I see no reason

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:18,730
why it wouldn't as far as I know it does

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,730
yes

00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,290
so that that's why I can't answer

00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:42,840
unfortunately about the east side of but

00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:45,670
I believe it does yes yes it does yes

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,610
it's not enabled by default but it is

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,110
installed by default so I'm actually

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,530
getting to the services bit of this

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:56,980
right now so I'll well let me let me go

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,480
through ok disk so you showed you the

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,700
management showed you how you assign the

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,510
partition create data etc everything's

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,680
good to go there the land management is

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,840
pretty straightforward is just like

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,250
assigning IP addresses if you have more

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,080
than one ethernet interface on your box

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,480
you can do things like port channel and

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,540
stuff like that with this so you can get

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,760
faster speeds out of it and then that's

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,840
where the network management is I don't

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,510
think there's really enough time to go

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,070
into all the things you can do there but

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,060
since we're looking at services let's

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,830
start with ssh since that just came up

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:35,590
so here's one of those another subtle

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,850
configuration bits about freenas way

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,090
over there on the right again there's a

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:43,210
little radio box for a little check box

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,010
for an able and it's on all of these and

00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,490
if you don't happen to see that off all

00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:52,600
of these options are grayed out so first

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:56,080
thing you have to do is enable it you

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,020
want it on 422 probably I mean fairly

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,210
safe whether or not you could basically

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,520
what this is doing is configuring you

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:08,910
know in Linux it would be under / etsy

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:11,410
/s s HD / sshd underscore config

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,370
basically this is the freebsd equivalent

00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:18,310
of that and all you're doing is

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:20,590
configuring it via web guru so and of

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:24,940
course it uses keys you can put keys in

00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:28,960
here so now it says it has to reboot the

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,000
system in order to enable ssh so let's

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,980
go ahead and do that and when I do that

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,980
we can actually watch it reboot here

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,890
and this won't take very long so by

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,130
default all of these services are

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:51,030
available to freenas but only none of

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,380
them are enabled by default so anything

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,420
you want freenas to be able to do I

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,130
think that's a good security model you

00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,230
know just have nothing available to

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:02,700
begin with and then you're forced to

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:06,900
turn everything you want on so we'll let

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:10,590
it boot up here again and with ssh

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:14,310
enabled you can now ssh into the box and

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,410
if you ssh you there's a normal user you

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,960
can well actually there's a user

00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,960
dialogue so you can have somebody who

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,670
has root access if you want they don't

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,060
need root access if you want you can set

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:32,880
their mount points shells etc just like

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:34,110
any other linux or bsd system so one

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,750
thing you might want to do is give

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:39,780
yourself access to like the mount where

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,570
all your data is so if you want to be

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:46,140
able to just go in there and use SCP or

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:52,050
SFTP to pull a file off randomly you can

00:24:46,140 --> 00:25:00,870
do that well lan IP address is still the

00:24:52,050 --> 00:25:06,240
same i may have to log in again now so

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,610
it was the same 192 168 56 dot 1010 of

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:14,720
course it's HTTPS now because I enabled

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:14,720
secure so don't forget that

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,990
and of course it's a once you know not

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,310
properly signed certificate so you'll

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,750
have to do this unless you want to pay

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:37,260
for one so anyway now you have ssh

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:41,700
enabled so if I ssh to 192 168 56 101

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:44,260
yeah it's just like a normal server I

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,300
don't have any user setup if you want to

00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:54,480
set up users you have to go to access

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:54,480
users and groups find the mythical plus

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,390
and then this of course is just

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,030
configuring your password file shadow

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,550
file etc so you can set up any users you

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:13,360
want in here give them what access you

00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:15,010
want and all that no you if you if you

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,660
ssh into this box and want to update

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:22,300
this stuff manually you certainly can do

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:24,670
that but then if you wanted to do that

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,840
you probably wouldn't need freenas you

00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:31,210
could probably sell all this stuff up on

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:36,280
your own it has weirdly support for

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,810
Active Directory so if you want to set

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,720
up your Active Directory domain and use

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,130
ldap for back-end storage or use freenas

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,670
for back-end storage you can do that

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:50,020
also supports openldap for user

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:52,420
authentication okay well here's the

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,030
another service you can enable CFS or

00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:00,150
samba so if you want to have windows

00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:03,610
shares all you have to do is enable and

00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,260
set your workgroup you know the options

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,360
are fairly straightforward if anybody's

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,220
dealt with CFS or samba before I mean

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,750
you've all seen this before this just

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,450
gives you a layer of abstraction so you

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:16,270
don't have to go into the SMB com file

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,460
and you know code all the blocks and

00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:21,750
everything however as you said if you

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,720
want to do it that way you can and

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,040
what's nice about it is if you do that

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,070
then when you come back to the GUI all

00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,149
this stuff will show up here because all

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,379
it's doing is

00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:38,289
giving you an overlay to the files

00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:39,429
underneath I don't have a windows box

00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:44,619
around here so I'm not going to even

00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:48,249
bother with this ftp think we all get

00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:51,039
ftp you set it up you specify you know

00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:53,999
partitions that you can ftp to you get

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,759
an ftp access to those files real simple

00:27:53,999 --> 00:28:01,330
same with tftp you can actually write

00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,279
via tftp and read from via tftp so if

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,309
you have like a cisco phones or some

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:11,849
sort of routers that get their config

00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:16,599
files via tftp you can use this for that

00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:17,799
NFS I think that was I think that was

00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:19,749
one of the things that came up first

00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:24,039
when we discussed what you might use

00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:25,509
this for was NFS so you set up an NFS

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:31,179
share on here you go to your local

00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:34,839
machine update your exports file are not

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:36,909
your exports file your your FS tab to

00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,679
reference an NFS share on this box and

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:45,899
then you have direct access to that the

00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:47,979
NFS sports Apple file sharing protocol

00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:49,359
don't know anything about this if

00:28:47,979 --> 00:29:01,139
anybody wants to talk about Apple file

00:28:49,359 --> 00:29:01,139
sharing go for it rsync is what

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:12,740
it's sorry okay it supports time machine

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,270
the backups okay you can do a backup you

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,260
can use time machine backup on your

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:20,120
Apple devices with a FB so that's cool

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:27,980
if anybody ever needs to do that there

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:29,660
you go Arts Inc is like I said before

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,970
it's a server and the client so you can

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,710
set this up with an rsync demon you just

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,280
enable it tell it what poured the

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,400
defaults 873 and then you can on any box

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,970
that has an rsync client on it you can

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,500
store files do mirrors whatever you want

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,530
but of course this can also be a client

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,760
so you can have its store its files

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,820
somewhere else maybe another freenas

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,770
server maybe share it back to you

00:29:51,820 --> 00:30:02,210
whatever you want to do anybody

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:04,190
unfamiliar with our sink that's good is

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,970
anybody familiar with unison because I

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,970
don't know what it is

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:21,670
okay kind of like Dropbox but ok but

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:25,000
using does it use our sink it's a known

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:35,980
protocol right okay is there another

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:38,770
comment about unison okay so you have an

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,240
essentially a Dropbox like Dropbox like

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,840
situation with unison it's

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,870
bi-directional our sink like protocol

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,260
that emulates Dropbox this this is

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,210
actually enabled not enabled but

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,660
configured by default so if you enable

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,740
it it's supposed to just work presumably

00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,230
you'd have to have another device that

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,090
also supports unison and I don't know

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:07,150
what those devices would be other than

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:16,870
another freenas box okay there are

00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:18,460
clients for various os's I was going to

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,020
spend a little bit of time on I skizzy

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:24,240
because it's a little complicated i'm

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,240
not sure it's worth doing that though

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,560
one nice thing about I scuzzy is they're

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,870
all it's a standard that is supported by

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,020
a lot of devices and freenas can support

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:37,390
iscsi in both directions it can be a

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:41,860
nice cozy target and it can be a nice

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:47,350
cozy initiator so if you have a sandbox

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:52,050
for example outside this box that is

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:54,670
able to terminate I scuzzy you can

00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:57,520
initiate a nice cozy connection from

00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:01,930
freenas to that sand and then offer it

00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,630
as local storage to freenas so that all

00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:07,480
of your devices have access to the sand

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,910
know that may or may not be necessary

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,940
because you may be able to actually

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,410
connect to that sand device directly but

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,740
if you want to consolidate where you

00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:22,780
have all of your storage you can you can

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:26,790
reference it here and what what the

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,790
iscsi target does

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,730
is basically what you would do is if you

00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:39,280
had a device that needed storage via I

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:42,790
skuzzy you could create a file in your

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,940
storage path that encompass is kind of

00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:48,490
like a vmware image eyes because it

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,940
creates a file that is then represented

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:54,880
as a directory or storage area and then

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:58,710
any device that knows how to initiate a

00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,240
connection via I scuzzy can see it and

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,710
connect to it and it will just show up

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,920
like another file system on that device

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:11,860
but it's it's actually a file like so

00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:16,420
it's like an image file on the freenas

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:19,870
server it's a little it's a little

00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,160
complicated to set up not because not

00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,950
because it's that complicated but

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:31,930
because the way that targets are named

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:37,060
is things like this and when you

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:41,890
initiate a nice cozy session you have to

00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:47,290
discover and directly reference that in

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:48,580
order to mount it so once you understand

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,110
the nomenclature it's not that big a

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,270
deal but you kind of have to get through

00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:56,080
the whole idea of the way eyes because

00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:59,080
he works and one of the nice things

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,670
about ice cozy is because because this

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,990
box and other boxes can use things like

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,030
port channel and ice because he

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,340
recognizes those a single leaf Ethernet

00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:10,050
connections you can have very high speed

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,640
transfer across network storage devices

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:16,290
using ice cozy almost as fast as

00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,290
something directly connected

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:25,909
as far as as far as Linux is concerned

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:32,090
this is a linux mint which is basically

00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:36,470
debian there's this package called open

00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:41,090
dash I scuzzy and if you want to if you

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:43,399
want to set up your your machine as a

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,350
nice cozy target or as a nice because

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,840
the initiator you would install this

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,179
package I assume it's similar for redhat

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,149
ish so anyone know what the ice busy

00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:58,910
packages for red hat I suppose you what

00:34:53,149 --> 00:35:03,770
I hi skizzy initiator utils okay I like

00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:13,730
open eyes cozy it's just called I submit

00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:14,990
a package called I scuzzy ok so anyway

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,880
there's a there's a package for the

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:22,010
four-year opensuse and whatever for

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:29,150
variety as well what this does for you

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:31,420
is give you some utilities yes I'll be

00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,420
rude

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:42,320
which will discover any I scuzzy targets

00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,500
that you can connect to so here's a few

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,990
of them here and with a little bit of

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:51,200
command line foo you can connect to this

00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:53,089
device via I scuzzy and you can set it

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,560
to connect to it every time your system

00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:56,950
boots so you don't have to do that ever

00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,300
again you'll just do it automatically

00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:03,890
and then you'll go into your FS tab and

00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,800
you'll put in a line similar to this one

00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:09,520
down here at the bottom that references

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,070
the I scuzzy name of the storage device

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,640
where you want to mount it what kind it

00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:19,339
is say that it's a network device and

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,770
then whenever your system boots up you

00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:24,920
will have a local file system called I

00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:30,170
skazhi one that's as big as whatever

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,970
size that partition is and when you

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,400
store it when you store things on it

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,820
you're actually storing it on your free

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,820
nasir

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,940
let's see you can also set up

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:52,050
authentication I scuzzy by default i

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,760
believe is unauthenticated if a target

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,170
is out there you can connect to it but

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,290
here you can actually set up user name

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:02,690
and password authentication so you don't

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,690
you could also limit by IP address so on

00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:15,660
upnp I find this really neat for things

00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:20,330
like your Xbox or XBMC or any other

00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:23,040
media services that support you pnp

00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:26,810
because you can put all of your movies

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:30,930
or whatever music on your FreeNAS box

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:32,640
enable upnp and those things like XBMC

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:38,130
and boxee and all the other stuff that

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:41,490
support upnp they'll show up you'll have

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:46,560
access to them automatically it's pretty

00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:52,100
much as simple as enabling it telling it

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,940
which directory you want to serve

00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,890
presumably you'd have something called

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,920
it's like media or something like that

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,170
where all your movies are and then any

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,810
upnp enabled devices will just find it

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:12,090
and those files would be available and

00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:18,050
not only that but you can click down

00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:20,760
here and then you will have 449 152

00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,320
another web browser you can another web

00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,440
access you can go to with your browser

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,470
to directly manage your media files be

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,060
kind of like mediatomb and it may may in

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,240
fact actually be me to you too i'm not

00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,240
sure

00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:53,310
alright so upnp you can also have a

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,980
remote dap or itunes library so if you

00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,630
want to store all your music on here and

00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:02,730
have it accessible as a remote library

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:06,540
in itunes you can do that although you

00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:09,450
know its itunes take it or leave it i

00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,120
guess here's your configuration for

00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,130
dynamic dns if you want to use dns org

00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,570
for your serving so you don't have to

00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,300
have a static IP address for your free

00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:22,640
nas box and you set that up here pretty

00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,640
straightforward configuration for that

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,480
now this can be pulled as an SNMP device

00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:36,390
and it can also send SNMP traps to your

00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,460
SNMP trap server if for example your

00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:43,560
monitoring like disc temperatures using

00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:46,170
smart or file transactions or whatever

00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,680
this can actually send those bits of

00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,930
information to an SNMP trap server so

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:59,580
that you have instant notification when

00:39:51,930 --> 00:40:01,410
certain events happen this is I'm not

00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,510
sure how applicable this is for like a

00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:09,180
home user setting up a freenas box most

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:10,950
people don't really get into SNMP so I'm

00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,510
not sure how deep the intestine NP i

00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:18,150
should go is anyone interested more

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:21,260
information about SNMP or just making me

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,260
happy so I don't have to say anything

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,529
freenas can also monitor the UPS is

00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:35,990
connected to and going back to those

00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:37,819
SNMP traps and also the email bit you

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,789
set up before it can send you

00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:42,470
notifications if there's a power failure

00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:45,140
it could send an SNMP trap if there's a

00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,990
power failure and you can also get it to

00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,779
shut the system down in the event of a

00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:53,380
long power failure so I'll actually

00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:59,029
monitor a connected you at UPS device

00:40:53,380 --> 00:41:00,470
pretty handy and I think you'll notice

00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:03,740
that most of these things you can do as

00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:07,549
a normal server are on a normal server

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:09,109
this just gives you a really easy way to

00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:15,769
get to all of this stuff that you might

00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:17,119
want to do normally well this is weird

00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:20,299
you're looking at a website you're

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,220
looking at a web you know browser and

00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:26,690
there's a thing about a web server

00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:28,789
that's not enabled but it's here why is

00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:31,220
it here well the reason it's here is

00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:36,009
because this can actually give you web

00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:39,980
access to your files on a different port

00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:42,980
than port 80 or 443 which is what we're

00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:47,869
on now so you just set this up with well

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:59,589
it's what's about doing HTTPS let's do a

00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:59,589
port 80 65 make the document root data

00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,460
and we want an able authentication

00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,960
because this is just a local box I what

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,700
I would though and when you enable that

00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,380
authentication uses the authentication

00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,630
you've configured before whether you

00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,730
have local users active directory or

00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:19,780
LDAP that's where it gets its

00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:28,410
authentication data so now we've enabled

00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:28,410
that we can go up here 256 101 80-65

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:38,380
give the right address I did yeah and

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,470
then since there's nothing there there's

00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:48,640
a thing where you can enable I believe

00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:52,900
if you enable this then we'll show us

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,340
the fact that there's nothing there and

00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,710
if there of course there was something

00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,780
there you would see it and you can do

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:03,490
direct HTTP transfers from this if you

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:05,500
want to download a file or whatever this

00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,650
last one is the one that I just recently

00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,550
discovered and I think this is cool

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:16,990
especially if you like BitTorrent

00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:26,130
because if you enable this and what's

00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:26,130
created download directory data torrent

00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,300
I usually turn off distributed hash

00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,920
table if you're into BitTorrent you'll

00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:42,940
know why if you're not don't worry about

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:45,160
it you can set your upload and download

00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,350
limits here for any files you want to

00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,410
serve via BitTorrent or any files you

00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:52,960
want to receive via BitTorrent one thing

00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:56,910
I will say is that this is a global

00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,850
bandwidth setting this is not per file

00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:04,450
so if you set 50 kilobytes that's for

00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:05,950
every transfer not each one so if you

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,710
have to transfer is going it'll be 25

00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:11,800
each and also note that this kilobytes

00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,970
per second not kilobits per second most

00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,430
people and they think about transfer

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,050
speeds in kilobits per second so if

00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,500
you're thinking kilobits per second

00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:23,290
divided by eight so if you want it to be

00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:29,310
128 kilobits per second divided that by

00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:31,750
that so number you want to hear in here

00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,570
you can create a directory and if you

00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,120
like SSH or ftp into the box and dump a

00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:40,020
torrent file into this directory then it

00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:44,620
will automatically initiate the torrent

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,760
so you can do that might want to set an

00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,290
incomplete directory where it'll

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,610
download your torrents first and then

00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:53,590
move them into the final destination

00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:58,260
when they're finished and then it gives

00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:58,260
you a web interface

00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:17,970
hopefully this will actually work okay

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:19,530
good so if i go now to port 90 91 within

00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,500
my authentication data which i just

00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:25,079
submitted this gives you an interface to

00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,170
transmission the bittorrent client

00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,369
transmission and what I think is like i

00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,900
said if there was anything in that

00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:32,700
directory that watched directory if you

00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,810
said it the torrents would already be in

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:41,550
here doing whatever they're doing but

00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:45,270
what I think is neat about this is if I

00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:50,010
go to for example my blatant plug of my

00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:56,640
own website I'm only doing this because

00:45:50,010 --> 00:46:01,950
I know there's a torrent here and I go

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:05,609
to my torrent feeds and I wish the

00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:13,310
network wasn't too slow okay so this is

00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:17,660
a torrent file right here copy it open

00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,660
paste that URL here

00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,799
and this is just really slow or what

00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,430
try one more time

00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:56,920
oh this the the the host doesn't have

00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:59,890
networking that's right duh if the host

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,210
had networking that all your torrent's

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,750
would show up here and there be a

00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:08,560
progress indicator and then once once

00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:11,320
your torrent was done downloading it

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,080
would of course become a cedar so this

00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,510
is an easy way to instantly set up a

00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:28,140
sieve your box for any torrents you want

00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:30,910
to see let's see let's go back here okay

00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,110
so that's that's all the things you can

00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,760
configure and I'd be willing to bet that

00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,560
everybody in here can think of one of

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,100
those things they'd like to do with the

00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:42,700
server at home whether it be the iTunes

00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,770
or media sharing or whatever it is I use

00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:50,190
almost every feature that this has to

00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:52,450
offer initially we showed the the system

00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:55,090
shows you information about your system

00:47:52,450 --> 00:48:02,440
how long it's been up utilization so on

00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:03,910
so forth here's a top rendered as a

00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,410
webpage show you what services are

00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:11,470
running this is a this is a cool page

00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,960
right here all of the things that you

00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,450
have configured and enabled and what

00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,310
status there in just give you a little

00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:20,710
right you know green check or red minus

00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:28,039
right here your whole freenas server at

00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:31,410
a glance I do not

00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:37,920
but let's see if it shows up in the in

00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:43,619
the process list nope it's a little far

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:52,950
down for that let me get a show right

00:48:43,619 --> 00:49:03,239
here oh and once you see transmission

00:48:52,950 --> 00:49:04,529
light HTTP it's probably it's not

00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:13,950
running actually is it I haven't enabled

00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:15,509
ftp so let's do that so enable ftp I'm

00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:18,299
going to ignore all the options for

00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:21,950
right now I hope I didn't need to set

00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:21,950
one and of course I did

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,420
yeah okay parameters are added to pro

00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,420
ftv.com so obviously it's pro ftp

00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:45,279
you can read you can replicate using our

00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:48,129
sink but I don't think there's any true

00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:51,459
cluster support that though not that I'm

00:49:48,129 --> 00:49:53,889
aware of there are there is the

00:49:51,459 --> 00:49:56,729
capability in free nest for loadable

00:49:53,889 --> 00:50:04,239
modules so there may be a third-party

00:49:56,729 --> 00:50:05,709
module that supports it yes it does not

00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,389
that I'm aware of but of course it's

00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:09,009
just a Linux box so if you wanted to add

00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:11,079
a print server to it all rights a

00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,399
freebsd box sorry so if you wanted to

00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:15,459
add a print server to it you certainly

00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:22,389
could but it doesn't do print serving in

00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:24,989
freeness Donal printers have their own

00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,989
print servers now

00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:39,570
alright so we showed you how to look at

00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:43,880
see what servers here's a list of fear

00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:48,660
active interfaces showing traffic etc

00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,430
because your disks you can see basic

00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:55,350
information if smart was enabled you

00:50:50,430 --> 00:51:00,710
would see smart data as well and then

00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:00,710
you actually have live utilization chart

00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:12,920
you can see your interfaces and you can

00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:12,920
see your CPU hundred yes

00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:21,849
I could not because I used this and they

00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:25,680
did everything that I could ever imagine

00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:25,680
and I never had to look anywhere else

00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:55,450
email reports you can have this either

00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:57,489
run immediately click a button you get a

00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,619
report on the status of your sister you

00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:01,720
can also have it run periodically like

00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:05,549
every day whatever get updates on your

00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:08,380
system you can do the same thing with

00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:10,420
your log you can have the sent to you if

00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:15,430
you like any information that comes in

00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:16,930
like the boot log or the syslog basic

00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,299
information on all of your different

00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:22,390
things up here your disk partition smart

00:52:19,299 --> 00:52:24,430
usage software raid I scuzzy you can get

00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:29,859
data on all of that stuff right from

00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:31,359
here you can do some basic Diagnostics

00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:33,309
with ping and traceroute in for network

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,660
connectivity see your ARP tables or

00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:40,119
static route settings and then you have

00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:41,469
a basic file editor so if you don't want

00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:45,099
to actually connect to the box and use

00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:48,009
VI or emacs or whatever which you would

00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:51,130
have to install you can edit files on

00:52:48,009 --> 00:52:55,269
the file system right from here and then

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:58,180
it uses the quick explorer file browser

00:52:55,269 --> 00:53:00,549
so you can actually this is kind of like

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,920
the web access to your files but a

00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:07,200
little bit fancier mr. all it really is

00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,200
gives you access on a different port

00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,480
Oh

00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:21,000
so there you go basically it just looks

00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:24,690
like the HTTP HD to be accessed with a

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,800
couple of fancy or icons up here this is

00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:29,940
probably I think they're like the silk

00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,850
icon set or whatever and I believe you

00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:38,610
can actually move files around doing

00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:43,280
this and what not delete files etc so

00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:46,200
that in the 58th minute nutshell is

00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:53,460
freenas so I have like two minutes for

00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:55,230
any questions left over yes yes there is

00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,500
I didn't go into the network and fig

00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,820
stuff because I said it wasn't important

00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:07,800
well guess what it's probably important

00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:11,820
oh look I'd lock me out and I didn't

00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:13,800
actually change that oh that's that's

00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,440
the other server I think no no is the

00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:21,950
right one I don't know anyway yes there

00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:21,950
is firewall configuration right here and

00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:32,250
what is the bsd firewall thing it's what

00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:34,020
PF right so this is configuring PF uh

00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:41,880
looks like i still have about a minute

00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:44,760
left so yes they do have an embedded I

00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,770
so I don't know what it runs on I don't

00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,720
know if it's i386 only or if it will

00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,160
actually run on arms or anything like

00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:59,780
that does anybody know if it runs on the

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:59,780
other platforms probably just i386 yes

00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:09,010
okay common was it in version 8 the

00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:13,180
latest version support for things like

00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:16,600
itunes and unison have been removed bit

00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:27,580
torrents been removed as well okay so

00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:28,810
you use version 7 all right yes not that

00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,270
I'm aware of but they could be out there

00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:33,760
I'm just going over the PM what's built

00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,780
into it I mean but there is module sport

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,160
out there I don't know what's been

00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:47,530
written no time for one more meeting yes

00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:56,110
I don't know do you know if Ray if eight

00:55:47,530 --> 00:56:00,940
is support for 86 CFS raid six in eight

00:55:56,110 --> 00:56:03,210
I guess that's my time so thank you very

00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,210
much

00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:21,549
no answer

00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,720
something that's similar to this

00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
powerful

00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,830
what about this I can help you like it

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,060
we have the same problem or whatever a

00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,060
few years you think

00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:48,800
that's not the word out

00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,800
you

00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:03,470
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,030
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,980
cloud is just the next generation of

00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,960
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,970
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,079
we're in a unique position to really

00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,180
help bring these two worlds together

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,520
these different sets of technologies and

00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,859
to help companies embrace this new world

00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,869
in this great new tool that allows

00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:23,450
faster innovation not only is it about

00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:28,460
us being responsive and accountable but

00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:31,220
it's about us doing more for you whether

00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:35,240
less an OS that works the way that you

00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:39,400
do across all your devices HP Slate and
