the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,900
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,400

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,060
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,210
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,060 --> 00:01:08,760
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,210 --> 00:01:12,380
make these videos about how open is

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:18,869
changing the world thank you though ooh

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:21,299
that's love Thanks so I hope that by now

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,270
which I move this down some that's super

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,790
loud you've had a chance to come by the

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,350
booth and check out open source com but

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,780
if you had one I'll take a minute to

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,850
tell you about what it is and even more

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,070
specifically what is it isn't so Red Hat

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,530
launched open source com about a year

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,210
and a half ago and whenever I try to

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,650
describe to new people they say oh so

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,930
it's like source for a droid I can

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,250
upload my software I say no it's not

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,869
like sourceforge when they said well is

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,850
it like open hatch where maybe I could

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,189
find a project and I say nope it's not

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,899
like open hatch well maybe it's OS all

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,990
you can tell me what software to use and

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,119
I say no it's not like OS salt at all so

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,710
open source com is completely unrelated

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,930
to technology sorry and what we talk

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,430
about instead is how all the things that

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,590
make open source work really well as a

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,599
software development model how those can

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,450
be applied in other ways and we split

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,720
the content into what we call channels

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,000
business education government

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,800
law life and health and talk about how

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
open source principles affect all of

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,660
those areas and this is a now kind of

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,950
older screenshot of the site but you can

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,850
see we've also added now the health

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,800
channel across that blue bar one of the

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,410
things that we use open source com for

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,020
is to try to explain what open source

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,330
means to someone who's coming at it

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,130
completely new if you have no idea what

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,810
open source software is how would you

00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,280
describe it to someone and so for a lot

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,990
of people the first thing they think of

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,410
when they think of this collaboration

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,390
kind of effort is a wiki and lostpedia

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,160
is a really great example of one outside

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,740
of wikipedia where people who are all

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,440
fans of this show spent exorbitant

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,720
amounts of time compiling all of this

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,310
information about the show and as like

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
this is an example I pull up this page

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,510
because as far as i know this map shows

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,850
up for like 10 seconds in one episode

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,290
and yet people dragged out all this

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,330
information to put it together so you

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,440
can find out what the math maps to and

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,400
it was really grateful because that

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,360
meant that i didn't have to try to

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,519
figure it out but then these people new

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,320
to open source say sometimes that whole

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,590
collaboration thing doesn't really work

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,810
out like say when Stephen Colbert edited

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,910
Wikipedia to say that Conan O'Brien like

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,269
to club sea turtles with canoe paddles

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,300
and it got accepted and he showed that

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,970
on the show and so at open source com we

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,610
give you vast ways to talk about how all

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,590
of these principles are working outside

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,030
of technology and the reason I started

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,890
talking about these principles and not

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,390
necessarily just these five but a lot

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,400
more is because we originally were

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,560
talking about the open-source way as a

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,180
collective term for all of these but

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,340
that's about as effective as referring

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,470
to intellectual property to talk about

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,230
vastly different terms like copyright

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,700
and patents and trademarks it works as a

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,170
collective term but it's not entirely

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,730
accurate and it's sometimes misleading

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,380
and so I found that when I was talking

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,640
about the open-source way people

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,140
immediately assumed I was talking about

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,209
software so instead I started talking

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,230
about these principles instead and so

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,120
that's how I'm going to tell you a few

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,709
stories today and I hope that at least

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,780
one of the stories interests you and

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,489
maybe by the end you'll be ready to tell

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,330
me your own stories that we can post on

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:23,979
the site so first we'll talk about some

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,260
community projects the first is a

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,790
furnace a furnace isn't

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,220
camera it's an offshoot of the elf 0

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,990
which is an open hardware camera for

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,480
scientific applications it's been used

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,460
for the google books and google street

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,220
view projects and for cool things like

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,610
under eye sea exploration in the Arctic

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,170
and so the people who knew about this

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,480
camera and we're more interested in

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,400
cinema applications said we really like

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,370
to have something like this because as

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,440
cameras became more digital they also

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,360
became more proprietary because that was

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,800
a way to make them more expensive you

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,840
could lock down little bits inside the

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,310
camera and nobody could get to them so

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,110
through this project this is another

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,670
shot taken with the after this they were

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,800
able to get this open hardware camera

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:11,490
down to i believe about seven hundred

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:14,020
dollars hackerspaces a very fundamental

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,030
example of the way communities function

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,620
and while a lot of you if you're how

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,600
many people have a hackerspace in your

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,680
community that you know about a lot of

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,840
the people you find they're probably

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,190
into linux into open source know about

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,140
that but there are also a good number of

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,330
them where it's just people who like to

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,430
work on cool projects but those are

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,220
people who are perfect for introducing

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,200
to open source software and more of

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,150
these principles and these pictures are

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,010
from sea bass in berlin which is one of

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,270
the oldest hackerspaces and it's it's my

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,950
favorite because there's this great miss

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,680
that goes along with it this is a

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,200
despise that comes out of it and the

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,630
story goes that there is a space station

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,090
that crashed while exiting a time warp

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,700
crashed in berlin this is the antenna of

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,870
the space station and there are seven

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,160
circles and their little bits of the

00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,450
technology I think sprinkled all over

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,040
Berlin there's this whole mythology

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,300
around it I think that just makes it

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:09,190
that much cooler as a hackerspace next

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:13,180
up gaming how many gamers are here you

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,190
came in Linux so a lot of people think

00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,680
well all I can really do is is unreal

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,540
and that was 2004 and that's kind of a

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,440
long time ago which is okay it's still

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,050
cool and there's a lot of stuff that

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,690
came out of it world of goo is my

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,250
favorite Linux ready game and it's even

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,690
it's great for kids if you haven't

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,170
played World of Goo it's a physics-based

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,460
game and not our physics but the physics

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,470
of goo and you have these little things

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,860
called goo balls and you have to connect

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,090
them to to reach a new point when world

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,010
of goo was initially mac and

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,720
there's only when they put the Linux

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,040
version out within two days it was

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,290
almost five percent of their downloads

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,639
and they had higher downloads on the day

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,380
they launched Linux than they ever had

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
in the history of the game which i think

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,040
is is evidence enough that people are

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,990
ready for gaming and Linux and if that

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,639
wasn't on April Fool's Day this year I

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,440
posted an article on open source com

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,260
called steam for Linux confirmed which

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,370
is this big gaming thing that people

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,720
have been waiting for on Linux for a

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,500
long time and a lot of people are really

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,110
mad at me for boasting that the humble

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,729
bundles are this super cool little

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,160
package they think they've been three of

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,169
them now where they put together about

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,639
fifty dollars worth of games and put it

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,010
out there and go with a pay what you

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,380
will model it's all drm free and it

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,410
benefits the eff and child's play which

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,479
is this great charity for kids what I

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,040
think is a fun fact about the humble

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,330
bundles this is a screenshot from the

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,820
last one which was called the humble

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,229
frozen white bundle the average Linux

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,750
user paid almost twelve dollars the

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:43,360
windows users for next principle sharing

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm going to show you a quick video I'm

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,500
going to try to make this whole sound

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,150
thing work from a story we talked about

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,010
where some kids are going to high school

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,010
online essentially

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,150
well you are witnessing one of the very

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,740
first orientation sessions on the open

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,970
high school of Utah they're meeting the

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,560
counselor and checking their schedule

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,570
they're getting their student pictures

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,580
taken they're signing in and doing their

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,290
forms and their feet we'd walk them

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,240
through how to sign into their classes

00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,310
so the next Monday they'll open up those

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,930
computers and have everything that they

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,430
need to be able to be successful

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:33,540
students at the Oakland High School of

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:36,900
Utah I'm Rachel and I chose high school

00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,930
because their view on flexibility and a

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,630
lot of interaction of teachers so it was

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,280
different from what else out there and I

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,930
just thought I'd be a good fit and it is

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,850
so I started skating when I was eight

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,370
now I just like travel for like contents

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,400
best parts been just like been able to

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,200
travel and skate now having like hassle

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,270
of school and take it with me my older

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,860
daughter went to it last year and she's

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,200
in China this year working in an

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,180
orphanage and she was able to take her

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:24,390
computer with her and do her classes in

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:27,510
China so great talk about on education

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,640
resources access education he's probably

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,230
there shut up or put some on the table

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,780
we're actually the first secondary

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,760
school that we know of below believe it

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,480
is using and creating their own

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,730
open-source curriculum I hire teachers

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,230
to go ahead and write a curriculum under

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,360
the instruction of our curriculum

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,790
director so the first thing that they do

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,680
is just gather content there's so much

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,480
oh we are out there once they have that

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,790
gather then they go through it and they

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,770
start aligning it to the state standard

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,560
then they start beefing it up and adding

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,840
in the screencast and we use skype and

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,150
Jing and Camtasia and voice thread and

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,590
slide rocket and blabber eyes and it's

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,420
like a foreign language all of the tech

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,250
tools that were able to use the thing

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,329
that I really like to speak how to get

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,399
more interactive

00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:12,660
and being able to have math outlets on

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,009
your thing where they're actually able

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,230
to play map games and you're actually

00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:17,939
able to see things happening which you

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,369
couldn't see in a textbook with the open

00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:22,699
source content you can modify it to meet

00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:25,410
your own student speed so when I found

00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:27,209
some stuff I tried it in my class didn't

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,179
work through it out try something else

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,100
that I found and it worked and so that's

00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,290
what I love about open source and not a

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,509
textbook is that can't just tear out

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,699
that chapter in the textbook but with

00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:40,649
open source you can now one of the first

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:42,839
things that feature will go to to look

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,189
at things as obviously her gradebook in

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,230
a gradebook you can actually go to

00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:48,089
individual assignments and so I'm going

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,290
to take a look at this this test right

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:54,720
here and we cannot just look at great

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,910
but we can look at scores on individual

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,189
questions and then I can take a look at

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,689
all these different items over here to

00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:04,170
give me more information to try to

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:07,410
decide was it a valid question do I need

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,480
to examine the content that the students

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,670
learn the questions from do I need to

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,549
look at the question and rewrite it so

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,529
all of these different levels of data

00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:19,350
and data analysis are available to our

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,360
teachers that we aren't available to a

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,759
teacher in African border unless they

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,980
have a program like this that is doing

00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,299
the math for them I love resourceful so

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,439
I'm still you know there ain't no

00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,029
they're trying but it was a lot harder

00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:33,059
we always talked about wanting to be

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,919
data-driven but it was hard when you're

00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,209
crunching all these paper tests to be

00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,919
able to go through and actually analyze

00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:40,339
each question and when each was she was

00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,419
whereas here it's at our fingertips here

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:45,179
I'll go ahead and stop there that keeps

00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,339
going for a little while longer but what

00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,399
I think is great about this I would have

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,839
loved the opportunity in high school to

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,459
get my work done and the amount of time

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,869
that it took me to do the work and then

00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,220
have the rest of the time to do whatever

00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,629
was important to me like the girl

00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,399
working in the orphanages or the kid

00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,699
who's doing competitive skateboarding I

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,009
think that's that's really awesome next

00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:06,419
up we have in the the music industry and

00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:07,589
if you have everybody wants to rule the

00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,350
world stuck in your head for the rest of

00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,629
the night I totally take the blame on

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,639
the Left we have Kurt Smith who was half

00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,639
of Tears for Fears responsible for sad

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,259
song he is doing some new collaborations

00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,639
and still working with tears for fears

00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,049
but what's great about him all his new

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,010
stuff he's releasing with Creative

00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,170
Commons licenses

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,940
and he has this wonderful justification

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,650
for it where he talks about how labels

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,260
hampered his ability to collaborate with

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,240
other people and he says I could spend

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,490
all my time protecting copyright against

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,840
probably unintended infringement if

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,640
there aren't that many people out there

00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,010
who just personally hate tears for fears

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,360
and want to steal all my stuff I could

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,040
spend all that time making new music

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,040
instead and so that's what I choose to

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,170
do and then Brad sucks is another

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,940
musician who licenses everything

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,830
Creative Commons have you never heard of

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,920
him you've probably heard his sounds in

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,260
pidgin he made all those sounds and he's

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,630
played with Jonathan Coulton and pollen

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,290
storm and some other super nerdy people

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:06,150
like that so now it's pop quiz oh no we

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,440
have another video sorry I got my notes

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,760
in the wrong order you know what a

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,040
reprap is or a MakerBot makes an

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,730
affordable open source 3d printer this

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,870
is a machine that can make things and

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,610
basically you put it together comes as a

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,350
kid and when you've got it you're done

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,500
you have a 3d printer that can sit on

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,200
your desktop and you send it you have an

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,300
STL file for an object and then you

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,520
slice it up in a program called

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,830
skateboards totally open source use a

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,050
program called replicator G which we

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,940
made up which takes the g-code which is

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,730
machine language send it to the machine

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,950
and whatever idea you had for a 3d

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,100
object gets made in the 3d printer I'm

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,050
feel about that's us we're obsessed with

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,450
open source and that for a few reasons

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,980
one we found a lot of inspiration from

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,140
the whole open source software community

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,210
we know that if we make it open source

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,340
and we let everybody who wants one of

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,340
these things also have all the designs

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,920
all the plans all the code all the

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,520
electronics of Eagle files all the

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,040
diagrams for the circuit boards but if

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,960
they want to make modifications to it it

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,820
makes it really easy you want to hack it

00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,400
and put a different kind of extruder on

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,600
it all them it's all the support is

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,340
there for you to be able to do whatever

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,870
you want with it but it's only a few

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,500
people were making this for we want

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,450
we're making it for architects engineers

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,200
designers

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,720
and then like I people who are in school

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,160
whether you're a professor or you earn

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,590
some sort of an institution where you

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,950
want a way to make objects really fast

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,000
and cheap but then we're also making it

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,750
for people who want to live in the

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,060
future we were promised flying cars we

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,690
were promised hoverboards we were

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,280
promised space colonies we were promised

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,170
all these magical things in the future

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,540
including a machine that would make

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,740
things for you whatever you want it we

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,370
can't really do anything about flying

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,100
cars yet but we can we've come up with a

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,830
platform for a three for a kit that you

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,740
can get and build your own 3d printer so

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,660
open video conference so I was one of I

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,220
was one of the early video bloggers it

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,320
was me and about 20 other people and

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,720
that was the time where like for YouTube

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,520
before blip before vimeo for all these

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,690
things we were all just sharing our

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,450
lives online giving tours of our houses

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:29,070
telling personal stories crying and we

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,990
were watching everything because there

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,120
were only 20 people doing it it was

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,910
really exciting and a lot of my friends

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,310
from from those days are here because

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,460
we're all obsessed with this idea of

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:44,910
sharing this idea of sharing our lives

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,550
and sharing things with people and open

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,100
video it might seem like it's all about

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,520
codex but it's actually about something

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,490
really personal sharing your life and

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,770
sharing check with video sharing really

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,420
special things her mother was right it's

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,690
better to share yeah I mean that's the

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,460
thing it's a culture of sharing this is

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,990
the most powerful interesting thing in

00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,280
the world right now this culture of

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:13,440
sharing you know back in the day you

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,620
know the hippies had free love and 80s

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,240
they have electronic music right now we

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,380
have a culture of sharing that's just

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,970
rocking the world like it

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,220
you can't even figure this out because

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,560
they're like they don't understand it at

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,060
all but like as soon as you share

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,620
something and somebody else does

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,420
something with it you get this feeling

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,070
of pride it's like fixing a bicycle or

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,320
something like this somebody is like

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,150
built on something you've done and it's

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,530
just this magical feeling as soon as you

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:42,640
have that magical feeling you're like

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:44,260
sharing it's the future I'm in and for

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,660
me ever since those early days the video

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,230
blogging I've just given everything to

00:16:46,660 --> 00:17:12,449
the Internet everything I've done up on

00:16:50,230 --> 00:17:12,449
the Internet I love that guy that's the

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,640
MakerBot Jack ami says there's the darth

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,660
vader het it is super cool if that's the

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,709
next question but i'll finish talking

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,910
about the MakerBot if you've never seen

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,260
when they're super cool and there are a

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,850
couple of variations on these 3d

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,470
printers now the reprap and some others

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,270
and they kind of have a reputation for

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,590
being self replicating and so if you

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,970
find somebody with one you just print

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,230
the parts for the next one and then you

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,970
print the parts for the next one and

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,380
hackerspaces tend to develop large

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,850
collections of them and don't know what

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,040
to do with them so if you would like one

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,120
you just find your local hackerspace

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,140
there's a great one if you have to be in

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,520
North Carolina there's a great one in

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,050
winston-salem where they are happy to

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,840
print you parts to build your own and

00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,540
it's not that hard it's kind of fun so

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,250
as we're talking about sharing I like

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,710
that guy it's like the poster boy for

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,400
sharing how many things UN think entered

00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:01,590
the public domain this year throw out

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,680
some numbers a million that'd be awesome

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:09,130
zero who says zero you you already knew

00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,170
that so we are currently in the United

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,960
States and what we call the public

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,160
domain black hole because nothing new is

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,950
going to enter the public domain in the

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,260
united states until 2019 because of

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,420
ridiculous changes in copyright law over

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,820
the years when copyright was conceived

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,710
of it was 14 years and then you had a

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,970
chance to renew for another 14 and that

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,020
was it if you want a more copyright

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,000
after that sorry and even as late as the

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,370
80s before things really trained

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,220
dramatically eighty-five percent of the

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:42,250
authors didn't renew and so that means

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,990
that under the 28-year rules the 14 plus

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,670
fourteen ninety three percent of the

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,860
books written in 1982 would have entered

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,350
the public domain this year but they

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,490
didn't the reason I say the mouse will

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,960
keep you and copyright forever is

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,720
because every time Mickey Mouse is about

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,390
to expire we get a little more copyright

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,310
and so this is a few things that did not

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,560
enter the the public domain this year

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,730
and I am certain that you can find at

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,890
least one thing on there that you would

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,930
have liked to have seen remixed or

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:12,820
freely available on Project Gutenberg or

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,710
otherwise available to you in the

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,250
healthcare field there are several

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,690
websites now that are taking

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,950
collaborative health information things

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,930
that people are willing to share about

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,670
their own health conditions and using

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,740
them to reach new results either

00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:30,130
personally where you've met a group of

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,770
people and say wow all you guys started

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,500
having foot pain at the same time so in

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,410
a month I can expect foot pain things

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,420
like that to cure together which used

00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,040
all of this aggregate data to make a

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,800
link that had only been speculated on

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,290
before between asthma and infertility

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,640
and so a lot of people over the years

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,350
have said that they thought that there

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,060
was a connection traditional research

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,770
hadn't been able to prove it but all of

00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,060
this aggregate data from people willing

00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,190
to share their information on care

00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,230
together proved the link and if you're a

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,480
statistical sort of person here's the

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,000
statistical information they also proved

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,150
a link to endometriosis which has a high

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,410
relationship known with infertility

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,960
there's another site that does some

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,610
similar work called patients like me and

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
so if you're interested in that I highly

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,700
recommend checking out the health

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,040
channel and open source com you can go

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,270
to open source com / health and we've

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,070
been talking about this a lot more about

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,720
whether you're willing to share your

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,170
information are you willing to tell the

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,720
whole world anonymously of course I have

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,400
AIDS I have been pregnant 12 times and

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,650
miscarried eight of them what are you

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,360
willing to share and who are you willing

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,160
to share it with your doctor your family

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,910
your friends a whole bunch of strangers

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,220
across the Internet I just heard there

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,770
was a big health conference about three

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,090
days ago and I heard that Aetna the

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,410
insurance company is trying to

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,620
transition to

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:53,170
this more patient-friendly model they

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,270
had some very marketing word for it but

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,610
not so focused on the profitability of

00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,140
insurance and they have a million

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,600
customers already sharing their

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,190
aggregate data like this with aetna and

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,790
they're doing a lot of great stuff with

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,410
it also from that that same conference

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,970
so I've only known about this for about

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,700
three days and I'm so excited I want to

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,980
tell everybody I met about it it's it's

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,900
local health data org you can go to it

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,240
and it's this awesome little tool called

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,970
ozio mo which is a Nigerian word for

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,730
good news and the problem they were

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,610
trying to address was a lack of media

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,630
coverage of particularly cancer although

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,400
that's something only kind of

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,930
information you can look up and

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,550
particularly for minorities which again

00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,040
is not the only kind of information you

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,050
can look up but what you do is you drill

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,640
down through this data tab and you can

00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,930
sort forward the type of information

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,320
you're looking for on the type of

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:46,450
condition sort by ethnicity by sex by

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,400
age and immediately add these little

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,680
clips of information to your clipboard

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,270
and then if you're a journalist there's

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,740
another tab where you can go and you can

00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,940
paste in your article and immediately

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,560
send over these little clips of

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,210
information and you can do the same

00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,380
thing with charts and here's an image

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,420
search for you can look for the type of

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:05,430
images you're looking for and they've

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:09,010
increased local health coverage of

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:11,320
fifteen percent so far just by having

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,210
this tool available for newspapers who

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,040
are willing to use it and so compiling

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,180
this amount of information I decided to

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,190
use Spartanburg since that's where we

00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,770
are portunity I'm writing a story about

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,200
Spartanburg County and african-american

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,300
women over 50 this whole thing took me

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,920
maybe three minutes to search down for

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,800
and compile and that was mostly because

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,450
the internet here is slow so again that

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,870
was local health data or gif you want to

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,970
go play with it it won the recent health

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,390
to toe and national cancer institute's

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,800
developer challenge it's pretty cool

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,630
moving down our list of principles on to

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,310
transparency which I almost think of as

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,480
a synonym for openness so it's a good

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,740
catch all you know a lot of these

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,130
stories could fall into any of these

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,050
categories I'm a big fan of NASA I'm

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,660
headed down to the last shuttle launch

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,000
and a few weeks and they've been doing a

00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,039
ton with this NASA open government plan

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,679
lately and they really are

00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,539
are leading the charge under the Obama

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,799
administration for the call for open

00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:07,960
data and what you can do with open data

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,210
and if you had told me six months ago

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,279
that I would happily read a hundred and

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,629
seventy two page government report I

00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,309
would have thought you were insane and

00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:17,129
yet that's exactly what I did when they

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:21,489
published the open government plan it

00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:22,899
reported on 150 milestones and 19 open

00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:24,999
government projects a lot of them

00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:27,729
related to open source software and each

00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:29,200
one of those reports talks about how

00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:31,169
they're doing on collaboration

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,700
transparency and participation and

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:35,229
there's a report on everything from how

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,619
they're handling Freedom of Information

00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:40,659
Act requests to declassifying data that

00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:42,279
has been held secret to how they're

00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,989
going to involve the public in NASA's

00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,999
future the word crowdsourcing comes up a

00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,559
lot and NASA is facing a lot of problems

00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:50,200
right now you they have no money anymore

00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,789
essentially and so they're relying a lot

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,679
on what the public is going to be able

00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:56,139
to offer them going forwards this is

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,330
just a little tiny piece of a really

00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,649
long and cool infographic and i'll post

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,450
all the links to this later on open

00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:04,779
source com if you want to go look

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,739
everything up speaking of government

00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:09,879
does anybody know this is these are

00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:13,629
pictures of this is the dome over the

00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:15,519
reichstag in berlin and so as i'm sure

00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:17,590
you all remember from history class the

00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,200
german government has been through some

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,359
turmoil over the years say and the

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,700
reichstag was constructed in the late

00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:26,950
1890s in 1916 there was an inscription

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,239
that i will not attempt to say in german

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,279
because my German is terrible but it

00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:31,749
meant to the German people which if you

00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,330
think in the context of German history

00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:37,269
is kind of interesting then in 1999 they

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,979
built this dome over the the building

00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,399
and so there are so many cool things

00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:44,710
about this this whole part down here

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:47,349
looks down into Parliament and the idea

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,940
was that the people would always be able

00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:50,619
to look down over the government and see

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,359
what they were doing so that history

00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:53,830
would never repeat itself and there are

00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,599
a lot of other fun facts that's that's

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,009
the transparency in government part but

00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,359
if you'd like to read more about this

00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:00,460
particularly if you like architecture

00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,169
these paths where you can walk up all

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,029
the way around the dome you don't come

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,009
down the same path there they're

00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:07,570
intertwined and so you come down a

00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:08,980
different one and then there's this cool

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,179
sunshade so that if you happen to be a

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,379
member of parliament you don't have the

00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:13,379
Sun glaring in your eyes all day

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:19,280
also over in Europe this is tidy street

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,640
a little a little residential Lane in

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:26,210
Brighton in the UK and they are aware

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,120
that consumers who are informed of their

00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,610
electricity usage tend to lower it but

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,980
there's different information about how

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,170
i give you the data and what you know

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,809
about how your data compares to anyone

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,760
else's data and so they said well let's

00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,980
just make it public and so every day

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,900
they have a local graffiti artist

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,600
updating the street with the streets

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,340
electricity usage data and they have

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,100
lowered their energy use fifteen percent

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,420
in about two weeks because every morning

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,280
you walk out and you know exactly what

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,170
everybody did last night but they're

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,940
doing it in aggregate its neighborhoods

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,290
data it's not your window doesn't show

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,460
your neighbors that you left lights on

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:07,490
all night it's how you're all doing

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:09,260
together this is this is I call it the

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,730
most compelling story that I've heard in

00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,040
the last year and a half of doing open

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,080
source com as to why openness and even

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,700
open source software is important and I

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,170
also always say that I feel like I'm

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,929
stealing somebody else's story because i

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,040
heard it at linux con last year but i

00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,870
feel like it's that important i just

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,610
want to keep telling her story karen

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,290
sandler from the software freedom law

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,270
center found out that she needed a

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,090
pacemaker she was in danger of sudden

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,490
cardiac death and so she went to the

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,140
pacemaker company and said could I see

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,880
the source code that's going to save my

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:42,290
life and raise your hand if you think

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:45,320
they said yes and so she said I'll be

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,760
happy to sign an NDA but seriously if

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,820
you're implanting source code in my

00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,540
chest I would like to see it and they

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,450
said no and so the medical device

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,390
security center conducted a study on

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,760
implanted medical devices and found that

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:05,720
with some really complicated hardware

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,390
likes a PC and an antenna they could

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,130
easily access your implanted device and

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,170
that it was transmitting your patient

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,840
data unencrypted and they could see your

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,870
name and your information and maybe even

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:22,190
say induce ventricular fibrillation and

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:24,200
kill you so if open source software is

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,230
not important to save your life I don't

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,450
know what it is furthermore there is

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,970
is case president Rigel versus Medtronic

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,860
that prevents patients from challenging

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,650
the effectiveness or safety of a device

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,059
that the FDA has already approved so if

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,100
you're not really okay with this your

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:42,830
choices are not have a pacemaker and die

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,360
or have a pacemaker and let's admit the

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,010
chances of someone hacking into your

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,679
pacemaker and killing you are low and

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,990
yet exists and there's nothing you can

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,730
do about it and she has written an

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,160
extensive paper called killed by code

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,820
appropriately enough about the entire

00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:02,480
situation perk it up a little with some

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,630
meritocracy and the military has nobody

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,940
ever dies there this is general Hugh

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,720
Shelton who is now also the chairman of

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,220
the board for red hat and I have to

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,110
admit that when I heard that our new

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,150
chairman of the board was the former

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,570
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff I

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:23,360
thought exactly what does a 40-year

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,070
military man have to do with red hat I

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,870
didn't I didn't get it at all and

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,250
fortunately I was lucky enough to have

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,250
the chance we have a series of webcasts

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:33,950
and he did one with us about his book

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,330
which came out last October and when my

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,000
boss said would you like to read this

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,440
500 page autobiography of a military man

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,510
and I have absolutely no military

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,020
connection history in my family at all I

00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:47,030
was like yeah okay for the webcast I'll

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,770
read it it was fascinating I couldn't

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,210
stop reading it and I am just not a

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:54,590
military history kind of person at all

00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:56,360
and so to get to the point a meritocracy

00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,280
in the military the military really is

00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,510
our oldest form of meritocracy and it's

00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,390
what we rely on for open source

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,010
communities to function and so in our

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,140
webcast which we all have recorded you

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,820
can go listen to him he talks about not

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,250
just meritocracy but all of the

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,110
principles of the open-source way and

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,210
how they fit into his career with

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,299
military over the last 40 years going

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:20,780
all the way back to when he was a young

00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:22,309
army man in Vietnam and they didn't have

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,720
sophisticated software to figure out

00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,730
where the enemy was where they should

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,059
attack what they should do and his boss

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,500
said here's a massive pile of data come

00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,410
back to me in the morning and tell me

00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,179
what to do and so he and a colleague sat

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,140
down and and when you hear the story

00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,210
you're going to think well that seems

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,919
obvious and yet it's the 60s and it

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,450
didn't really seem that obvious they

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,000
took all the

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,130
data and maps the information they had

00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,810
about various enemy problems and the

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,790
areas and then they stack them on top of

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,250
each other and they had a little quarter

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,990
sized area that highlighted on every

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,370
transparency and they showed up the

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,080
meeting the next morning and said here

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,550
this is where I think we should target

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,500
and so now they've developed software

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,270
that does exactly what the two of them

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,370
did was transparencies and markers back

00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,990
in Vietnam today we call that rapid

00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,810
prototyping which we'll get to in a

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,730
minute he also I was trying to find

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:13,780
another clip to show you where he was on

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:15,670
The Daily Show and he talks about how at

00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,790
one of his first meetings with President

00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:21,520
Clinton's cabinet he was asked if we

00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:24,130
could find justification for war in Iraq

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,500
by perhaps flying an American plane

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,720
really low so that they could shoot it

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,840
down and would he be okay with that and

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,150
he said yes I think that is an excellent

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,480
idea just as soon as you get trained to

00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,860
fly that plane I suddenly developed a

00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,160
lot more respect for having the military

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,170
man in charge of our board of directors

00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,300
everybody know about Kickstarter raise

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,580
your hand Kickstarter so if not

00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,320
Kickstarter is a great way for

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,230
particularly creative projects to raise

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,270
funds and these are the top four fund

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,910
raider fundraisers that have used

00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,190
kickstarter diaspora was the project

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:05,070
that infamously attempted to bring down

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:07,720
facebook and is a new be using diaspora

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,510
okay maybe we can be friends i haven't

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,420
logged in a few months that's kind of

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,950
how it worked out but diaspora said we

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,330
need a little cash to get this thing

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,690
going and suddenly had two hundred

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:21,490
thousand dollars the glyph was a little

00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,230
iphone tripod they're actually working

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,480
on their second project now they asked

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:30,270
for I think about fifteen thousand

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:34,060
dollars and got 150,000 Muse open was to

00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:35,500
to make music good for the public or

00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,450
something along those lines and punk

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,210
mathematics was a punk rock math book

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,220
which is just kind of fun but though

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,590
yeah they all are doing very well with

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,510
the crowd source fundraising model I

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,570
have to say and a lot of people are just

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,620
even you don't have to raise two hundred

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,850
thousand dollars you can raise five

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,710
thousand dollars for the thing you think

00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,370
is great and one of the first stories I

00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,410
wrote for opens for

00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,030
calm was about somebody who previously

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,240
had written for some of the mainstream

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:04,120
role-playing game companies and he kind

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,790
of went a little rogue I guess and he

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,650
calls it ransoming he puts his books up

00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,270
and says if I get enough money on

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:13,059
Kickstarter then I'll release them with

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,890
a Creative Commons license and so then

00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:16,450
there's even this third level of benefit

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,309
where enough people said yes we're

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,630
willing to pay for this and because

00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:21,400
we're willing to pay for it everyone

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,600
else can have it for free which is a

00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:28,630
super cool use of Kickstarter promised

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,270
rapid prototyping here it is this is a

00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,980
perhaps apocryphal story but a good

00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,620
would nevertheless as the apocryphal

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:38,050
winds often are about a university

00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,000
campus that laid out their sidewalks and

00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,470
then everybody didn't use them they

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,710
walked off on their own path and killed

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:46,660
all the grass and so there are several

00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,030
places that in real life completely non

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,559
apocryphal stories have started using

00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,150
what are called desire lines where they

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,160
simply put down the grass and not the

00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,720
sidewalks and let people form their own

00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,059
paths and then that's where they built

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,250
the sidewalks which is a heck of a lot

00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,690
better way to run any project you figure

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,490
out what the people need and where

00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,020
they're growing and then you give them

00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,330
what they need not what you want them to

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:12,340
have it's a connection to all of your

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:14,200
projects here this is a company called

00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,520
design that matters and this is a

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,260
picture of a little baby incubator and

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,360
nearly two million babies die every year

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,490
just because they aren't kept warm in

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,200
their first month of life two billion

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,730
babies die before their month old just

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,429
because they were too cold that's it all

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,650
they needed was to be kept warm and so

00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:34,900
these guys got together some super smart

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,580
people and said we can solve this

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,960
problem they're one of the hospitals and

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,000
looked around and there were incubators

00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,370
there were plenty of them and this is

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,860
mostly in india and other poor asian

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,840
countries and they found plenty of

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,360
incubators in French which none of the

00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,100
nurses spoke or that were broken except

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,020
for a piece that would cost a nickel in

00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,590
the US but there was no way to obtain in

00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,850
India or junked incubators behind the

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,460
the hospital that nobody knew how to

00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,840
repair so they looked around and said

00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,970
what what would be the right way to

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,860
solve this well there's not a supply

00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,470
line for incubator parts but there is a

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,820
supply line for carp

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:13,960
so what if we could build an incubator

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:17,140
with car parts and so now babies alive

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:20,290
nurses fixing incubators it's a match

00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,030
made in heaven he they actually have

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,440
several other projects to I'm trying to

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:26,710
get him to write some more stories so

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,240
keep an eye on the site you've probably

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,010
heard of openstreetmap as well by now

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,320
but this I think is the greatest

00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,120
testament to its success after the

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,490
earthquake in Haiti there was a problem

00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,900
getting supplies to people who needed

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,550
them and getting people who need to be

00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,500
in hospital beds to hospital beds

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,210
because this is what the math looks like

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,310
and this is what the math look like

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,010
because it's not profitable to spend a

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,470
lot of money mapping poor places so

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,669
there simply wasn't available data

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:55,030
openstreetmap got together and very

00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:59,980
quickly turned this into that and then

00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:01,510
over that they laid the places where the

00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,980
different icons are probably hard to

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,990
read but they represented where you

00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,150
could find hospital beds places that

00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,040
still had medicine places that didn't

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,870
have anything to help and so this is

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,610
what helped the first responders get

00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,470
what they needed and so going back to

00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,650
this map this is what openstreetmap said

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:20,860
Oh cut it out there it is this is the

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,690
google map today of the same area so

00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:27,250
that's what the OpenStreetMap people can

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:28,600
do that's what Google can do and so some

00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,920
people say but we do talk about software

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,210
on the site because I always say we're

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,130
not talking about software I get a lot

00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,970
of people who who see open source com

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,140
and they want to tell me about their

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,670
cool project and I say I don't talk

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,630
about software and then they read the

00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,240
site they say we need to talk about

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,890
software and so I have to explain why it

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,630
usually comes down to patents we end up

00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,680
talking about software patents a lot and

00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,160
then that reaches out into other types

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,740
of patents and a few months ago a

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,920
federal district court in New York held

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,900
invalid patents held by myriad genetics

00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,540
for genes for the breast cancer genes

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,520
and testing for them and the result of

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,710
one company holding the patents on those

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,330
jeans was that women who needed the

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,130
testing for those genes had to pay a lot

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:08,230
of money and wait a lot longer than they

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,300
should treatments were being delayed and

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,710
then again you're talking about someone

00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,270
holding too much information being

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,960
responsible for someone possibly dying

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,550
and so fortunately the district court of

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,500
New York did the right thing and said

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,150
that you can't patent genes that's not

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,620
cool

00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,810
and they actually the ways of this

00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:28,900
connected back in particular to the site

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:31,060
was that they used the precedent set by

00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,290
bilski which a lot of people had look to

00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,690
for the future of software patents

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,730
although it actually was about business

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:41,560
method patents it all comes back around

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:45,310
sooner or later this is a page also in

00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,990
our legal realm of a comic book that was

00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,610
supposed to come out this spring but now

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:51,160
we're in the summer and so I'm still

00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:53,200
waiting but it's being put together by

00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,030
the the Center for the public domain at

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,490
Duke University and it's called theft a

00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,930
history of music and it's the second

00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,520
book that they've done like this the

00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,740
first one was called bound by copyright

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,020
and so they've taken these really

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,180
difficult legal concepts that a lot of

00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,440
people get really really wrong and put

00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,510
them in comic book form and they're

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,980
really fun to read and unfortunately I

00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,330
suspect the reason this one is delayed

00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,420
is because the really great guy who's

00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:18,220
artist on these died about a month ago

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,870
but there are so many good stories in

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,990
here that start with copyright going

00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,160
back to play doh who said and I have to

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,620
read this because I have to get the Play

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,720
Doh quote right any musical innovation

00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,630
is full of danger in the whole state and

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,180
all to be prohibited so we had remix

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:37,780
problems going back to Plato it didn't

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,830
start with you to the other thing that I

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,170
learned from this that was really

00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:45,280
interesting was about musical sampling

00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:47,590
and the case president set precedent set

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,870
by nwa with a hundred miles and runnin

00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,810
runnin I'm sorry there's probably no G

00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,660
on the end of that they they sampled

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:57,940
lowered the pitch of and loot to second

00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,740
guitar chord from a Funkadelic song and

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,820
the court said that that was too much

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:06,250
and so they asked de minimis is the the

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,930
legal concept for too little to care

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,850
about that's let de minimis Latin for

00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,010
too little to care about and so they

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,840
said what would that be in this case in

00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:15,850
music what would be too little to care

00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:21,190
about and the court said as little as

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:22,900
one note good luck with that and so I

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,570
highly recommend you can get bound by

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,030
copyright is a CC license so you can

00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:29,890
download it and when def de history of

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:33,130
music comes out it will be too and there

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,779
are all sorts of fun jokes and cartoons

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,269
so it's an awesome read

00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:39,009
it and if you just need to sneak preview

00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,289
we wrote a three piece story about this

00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:42,819
and the other reason that we talked

00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:44,589
about software is because it's cool

00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:46,599
there's so many fun things happening

00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:49,929
with open hardware and softer and in a

00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,150
general circular way the top left is the

00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:54,939
humanoid which is an open hardware

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,499
project to build a bipedal robot and if

00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:58,959
you've ever read anything about robotics

00:38:56,499 --> 00:39:00,369
that's incredibly difficult but perhaps

00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:02,890
could be done a lot more effectively

00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,809
with open source and collaboration the

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,779
next one is sparkles the soldering

00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:10,599
unicorn not necessarily approved by the

00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:12,669
fine folks of my little pony but she's

00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,319
out i think the toronto hackerspace is

00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:17,140
famous for building sparkles the

00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:19,059
soldering unicorn the next one is a

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,409
touchscreen interface built by somebody

00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:24,279
who thought minority report should be

00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:25,959
true these are shoes printed with the

00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:30,009
the cool robot printer that I showed you

00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:30,849
before this is the open Moto X I don't

00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:33,150
really know anything about motorbikes

00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:36,429
but I bet it's an awesome open motorbike

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,169
this is an open-source EEG machine to

00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:40,390
get back to the health care the

00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:41,919
BeagleBoard and in the last one is a

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,459
cake I made of an Arduino board because

00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:47,229
I think that's cool lastly I want to

00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:49,089
tell you again about our webcast like we

00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:51,339
have the general Shelton webcast all of

00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:53,019
them are archived at you there's a

00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:54,400
little webcast link at the top of open

00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:56,109
source com so you can go listen to the

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,299
old ones but these are the next two we

00:39:56,109 --> 00:40:01,869
have coming out jun 22nd we have dan

00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:03,579
pink who wrote this book called drive

00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:05,109
that came out a few months ago New York

00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,150
Times bestseller and he's going to be

00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:09,279
talking about motivation and how that

00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,400
affects the things we do and then on

00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:15,130
July seventh we are I am so lucky to

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,679
have todd park who is the CTO of health

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,779
and human services and not CTO in the

00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,549
sense of I care about your computer's

00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:25,839
but the CTO in the sense of he's in

00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:28,029
charge of Obama's call for open data in

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,739
health care and so he's the guys at the

00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:31,769
top of that chain and he's an amazing

00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:34,630
guy to hear speak he talks about how

00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:37,679
healthcare needs to follow the NOAA

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,849
model the National Oceanic help me out

00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,949
administration I'm missing an A in their

00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:43,749
weather data what they've done with

00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:45,759
weather data and how many people are

00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:47,019
able to use that he wants to be able to

00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:47,990
do with healthcare data and so I'm

00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:50,330
really looking forward to

00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,400
one July seventh you can register for

00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,200

me and that's about it thanks any

00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:20,510
questions all right there are not

00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,950
instant well now I really feel like a

00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:27,230
self-promoter there are not instructions

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:29,630
there are not it is the only of my not

00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,860
open cake I do i do post instructions

00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,210
for all the cakes and costumes and

00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,680
everything i make except as soon as you

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,110
can see from the pictures in a book and

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,880
thus i cannot post it on the internet

00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,920
but the book is called world of geek

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,119
crafts and has many other geeky projects

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,350
in it so you're welcome to check that

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,560
it's not my book either it's a friend's

00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,560
book

00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,420
mhm

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:17,059
a health care really I like to be alive

00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:19,489
is kind of what it comes down to a lot

00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:21,499
of changes in health care our insurance

00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:23,299
system is broken the way we deal with

00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:25,309
doctors is broken the way we take data

00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:27,799
from a doctor to another is broken I

00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,299
mean we're all for the most part young

00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:31,309
and probably relatively healthy people

00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,569
and it's not very hard for me when I sit

00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:34,009
down at the doctor's office to fill out

00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:36,380
that form that asked me if I have had

00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,940
any of 700 conditions in my lifetime

00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,380
because they're pretty much all knows

00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,910
but you reach a point where it's really

00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,109
hard to remember those things and I'm

00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,609
reaching that point now is I have to

00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:45,739
remember them for me and two children

00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:47,450
and occasionally a husband I can only

00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:48,950
imagine what happens when i get to be 60

00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,019
or 70 and try to remember that for all

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,940
of us so there's a lot going on with

00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:55,940
electronic health records and the

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:59,479
portability of that data and how they

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,880
can share it with one another there's a

00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:06,589
really interesting thing going on that

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,059
that isn't I guess successful is the

00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:11,089
word I'm looking for yet but that isn't

00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:13,489
what I mean a few years ago at Red Hat

00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:16,369
summit we had a keynote from dr. John ha

00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:18,430
Lanka who has far more titles than I

00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:21,380
could even begin to describe but he's a

00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:24,710
CIO of Harvard Medical School and

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,910
advisor to several federal agencies 73

00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,469
other things I can't remember and the

00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:32,529
last thing is and a practicing emergency

00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:35,930
physician and he has one of a number of

00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:38,299
implanted devices in his arm that at

00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,710
Beth Israel they are willing to implant

00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:41,150
you with and all it has on is the

00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,589
16-digit number it doesn't even have

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,390
your name it doesn't know anything about

00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:46,880
you but if you come in to Beth Israel

00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,319
they will unconscious obviously they

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,660
will scan your arm to see if you have

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,890
one and if you do that 16 digit number

00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,710
will be connected to your medical

00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:58,430
information and so potentially that is a

00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,930
huge change for you think of how many

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,380
people come into a hospital unconscious

00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,400
on any given day but then you're also

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,900
hoping that people are willing to be

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,509
implanted with a little 16-digit number

00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,190
and to have their data connected so

00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:11,509
there are a lot of issues with privacy

00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,519
and I think that's what makes health

00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:14,989
care one of the most interesting areas

00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,970
where we can apply openness because

00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:18,010
there are so many complex

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:21,670
issues to figure out but so much pay off

00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:27,580
when we do what do you think is the most

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:28,960
important thing to open its ok all i did

00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:37,349
was draw a portal cube and raise the

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:37,349
question any other questions all right I

00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:46,760
so if you get somebody to prince of

00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,140
parts for you it only costs a couple

00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,700
hundred dollars for the other parts to

00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,700
complete it it's really pretty cheap

00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:57,859
yeah I've been thinking about getting

00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,599
one to carry around open-source pompous

00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:00,830
because I'm still amazed at how many

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,119
people haven't seen one yet and they're

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:07,220
so cool so that's about it and for

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,270
anybody who came by the booth and I said

00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,339
I would give you drink tickets or a

00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:15,440
t-shirt if you came you can come obtain

00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:18,910
those now because I have drink tickets

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,910
left over from last night and t-shirts

00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,680
what about this I can help you like it

00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:36,640
we have the same problem but would

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,640
happen up a few years

00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,030
let's put the word out

00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,030
you

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:58,640
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:00,200
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,150
cloud is just the next generation of

00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,099
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,050
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:07,220
we're in a unique position to really

00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,349
help bring these two worlds together

00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,690
these different sets of technologies and

00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:14,390
to help companies embrace this new world

00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,700
this great new tool that allows faster

00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:18,710
innovation not only is it about us being

00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:24,190
responsive and accountable but it's

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:26,829
about us doing more for you whether less

00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:30,380
nos that works the way that you do

00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:34,540
