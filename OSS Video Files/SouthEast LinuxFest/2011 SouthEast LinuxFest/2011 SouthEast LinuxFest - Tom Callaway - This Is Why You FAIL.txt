00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,380
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

for helping make these videos possible

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,770
you for coming today one we're doing it

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,670
all over again tomorrow with drupalcamp

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,290
just wanted to mention a couple of

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,230
things there's been an errata to

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,840
tomorrow's speak talks as well they'll

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,530
be posted on the tripods in the center

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,020
and on this end there's a t-shirt that

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,600
we would like everybody here to sign one

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,660
of our organizers it's become an uncle

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,260
or an aunt I think as an aunt today jace

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,789
became an aunt and he knows he's going

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,379
to be out of money by the time she's 16

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,229
so this is her gift so if everyone was

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,490
signed a t-shirt we'd appreciate that as

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:13,010
just as last year I'd like to mention

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,750
that we did the math and once again you

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,210
people sitting here the community what

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,950
y'all were our largest sponsor this year

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,240
you act gave our largest corporate

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,850
donation by one hundred and sixty

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
percent so thank you y'all y'all make

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,240
this happen

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,250
and at immediately after spots talk

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,680
we're going to the lindsley take shows

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,350
going to do a quick raffle and then

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,980
there's a party at nine so and I think

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,120
that this is there's a there's a vendor

00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,940
here that would like to give a gift to

00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,620
spot before he talks but this is Tom

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:57,440
Calloway he's or eating the keynote tom

00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:59,690
is fedora let me start all over tom is

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,130
the fedora engineering manager and he's

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,470
the chairperson to fedora packaging

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,240
committee he's a prolific package

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,460
maintainer and he has extensive

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,090
experience moving spark machines I think

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,950
so this is Tom Calloway he's going to

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,030
speak and is sudo make coffee in the

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,030
room here you

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:32,230
thank you for sure thank you right I was

00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,519
a little worried that nobody's gonna

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,989
like me because you know they showed me

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,040
right before the drinks and right at the

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,260
end of the day when everybody's tired

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,310
but hey look at that that's thank you so

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,799

whoa okay I'm really sorry about that

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,550
guy marketing guys got in there I really

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,140
don't know what happened um so that has

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,870
nothing to do with anything what I'm

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,310
going to talk about today my

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,400
presentation is on this is why you fail

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,420
and how to avoid it everybody fails I

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,430
fail a lot it's not a bad thing however

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,810
as I describe to someone earlier if

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,910
you've just watched your three friends

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,180
go into the lion cage at the zoo and get

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:06,470
eaten it would be very bad for you to

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,709
follow them so my my talk is really to

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:12,200
point out some things that I've seen to

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,880
help you not get eaten by lions I will

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,709
describe all sorts of animals that can

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:22,220
eat you and if you choose to get eaten

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:23,450
after that well it's on you little

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,300
backstory here because it seems

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,740
appropriate in 1997 I was a junior at

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,220
north carolina school of science and

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,110
math and durham and i skipped the last

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,520
day of my junior year to go to linux

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,560
expo 1997 and i have to say I really

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,830
don't regret that day that i missed of

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,620
school at all because it was a wonderful

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,880
community run event just like self just

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,700
like so many other events that are

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,770
happening everywhere and the people i

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,060
met the things i learned the things i

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,850
saw and the experiences that I had

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,850
directly led to all of my career all of

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,190
my community experience so I strongly

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,870
encourage you to keep coming to events

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,540
like this keep supporting events like

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,460
this they do wonderful work the ideas

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,960
that you pick up the technologies that

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,270
you learn about and the people most

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,040
importantly that you meet will make the

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,330
difference that's what makes this

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:23,750
community wonderful so about me very

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,000
briefly I maintain 350 packages in

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,110
fedora which qualifies me as clinically

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,150
insane

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,000
but to add insult to injury I also

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,730
maintained chromium for fedora chromium

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,760
being so awesome that it can't go into

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,890
fedora i also have been packaging

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,910
third-party software of all kinds in RPM

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,310
format since 2001 and i also handle for

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,780
the religious now I'm not a lawyer but I

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,700
talked to the lawyers enough so I've

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,990
speak a good amount of legalese and that

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,670
can translate it into English on a

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,130
regular basis now we mentioned that this

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,290
presentation was going to be about fail

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,960
but really success is what we're after

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,400
we nobody starts a project starts

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,840
working in a community environment and

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,170
says gee I'm really hopeful for the

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,590
times I'm going to fail success is the

00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,210
goal but what does that actually mean

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,870
well I'm here to tell you that from a

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,660
community project perspective success is

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,490
when you have contributors because users

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,720
are great users validate that hey we're

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,000
doing something interesting but at the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,520
end of the day if you only have a user

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,200
ecosystem you're not really succeeding

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,720
because you are the only person writing

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,880
code for your users you want these users

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,920
to take that next logical step and start

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,020
sending patches and filling out bug

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,510
reports and helping other users enable

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,850
functionality writing plugins writing

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,860
add-ons making fan pages doing all sorts

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:51,690
of craziness that is some step beyond

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,320
just I use what you made for me and when

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,640
you start to have a successful community

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,560
one of the things that you look at is

00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,930
getting your software into a linux

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,190
distribution of some sort or bsd

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,930
distribution it could be any kind of

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,550
distribution again i work with linux but

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,710
there's nothing you know that says that

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,080
you can't see success if you've been you

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,650
know adopted into a unix flavor that's

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,420
doing the right stuff most linux users

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,430
get their software from their

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,990
distribution package set if it's

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,310
available there now if it's not

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,630
available there they'll surely go out

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,160
and look for it if it's something that's

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,930
compelling enough but at the end of the

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,630
day that is their first stop that is

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,760
their android market so to speak of

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,580
where i get my stuff from at a first

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,010
glance so a healthy community is going

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,630
to be helping to improve the project not

00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,850
just a code although that's a big part

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,230
of it you have users that are helping

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,910
each other

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,250
not having to hire people to solve user

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,020
problems and you're doing regular

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,230
releases because it's great that you did

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,330
a single code drop in 1998 and everybody

00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,190
still loves it but if you're not doing

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:59,880
regular releases your community will

00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:02,490
just dry up and go away so in summary no

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,830
fast project wants to fail but you've

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:09,630
got to do more than just have code that

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:11,340
works so this brings me to the meat of

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,830
my presentation which is something i

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:20,610
call points to fail in 2009 i was

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,080
feeling some pain with chromium and my

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,190
pain was expressed through a wide

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,460
variety of profanity punching things

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,830
frightening children generally being

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,360
disrupted able to anyone nearby and so

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,510
you know my friends and co-workers would

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,000
come to me and say spot why are you so

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,720
angry why do you hate life why do you

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,340
have my pets and I would say it's

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,660
chromium and that didn't really mean

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,340
anything to them because they saw

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,990
chromium is this cool looking sort of

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,850
browser that Google hit put out there

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,400
that half the people had downloaded and

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:57,240
installed from google directly and I

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,980
needed a way to quantify my pain in a

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,890
manner that didn't just include four

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,380
letter words so I started a list of the

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,670
things that they had done or rather had

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,260
not done that was causing my rage and

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,150
then as I started building this list I

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,620
kept thinking of other things that other

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,360
people that weren't chromium had done

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,730
that had caused rage for me in the past

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,470
or pain for me or made me not want to be

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,600
involved in that project or made me look

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,040
at the community and its code base and

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,190
run screaming away from it before i

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,810
started to package it and again some

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,490
things are worse than others so i gave

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,480
them a point score because hey everybody

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,980
loves to keep score on things like that

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,960
so i know plenty of you were involved

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,490
with open source projects i know that

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,530
some of you may be running or directly

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,150
contributing or involved with so please

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,680
feel free to keep score as we go along

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,980
the first thing is the size of the

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,080
codebase the bigger your code is the

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,340
harder it fails and and let's just be

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,060
fair about this because you can look at

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,510
things like

00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,300
uh like a libra office or the Linux

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,220
kernel and say well those are really big

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,080
coat basis but those are exceptions

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,460
those aren't the rule I mean more often

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,840
than not if you come across a code base

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,790
where the source code is more than 100

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,290
megabytes most people are going to stop

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,340
and take a really good hard look at

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,380
whether that's something they want to be

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,790
poking around inside do I want to be

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,010
contributing to a code base that's that

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,660
massive do I want to start looking at it

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,370
you might think Hunter megs isn't that

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,320
massive heck we all have terabyte drives

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,670
now are we worried about 100 Meg's but

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,070
hundred megahertz of source code is a

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,010
lot of source code that's a lot of stuff

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,270
to be looking at and again if your code

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,470
is more than 100 Meg's when it's

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:39,870
actually compressed you get some bonus

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:42,360
points for that one so source control

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,670
now is a brief lesson on source control

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,160
this is where the source lives there is

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,170
no good reason for a free or open source

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,410
project you not have public source

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,730
control nevertheless if the project

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,490
doesn't have it you go ahead and give

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,800
yourself 10 points you think in this day

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,600
and age of github and sourceforge and

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,980
all sorts of nonsense like that there's

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,470
nobody that doesn't have source control

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,000
publicly available and yet so many

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,800
projects are picking up 10 points right

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,630
here now we continue on this because

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,260
okay if you've got public source control

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,780
but you don't have a web viewer then you

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,420
get five points now if it exists but it

00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,460
doesn't actually work then you get 25

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,830
points too now if you're running

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:29,480
subversion I'm betting you need to go

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,480
ahead and give yourself five points

00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:34,399
that thing that abomination that you

00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,279
installed it lists directories and does

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,449
nothing else that is not a web viewer

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,189
that is an index.html now if there's no

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:44,569
documentation on how to use your source

00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:46,759
control you get an additional five

00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:48,349
points it takes no time whatsoever to

00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,999
the documentation that says here's how

00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:51,949
you check out here's how you commit in

00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:53,239
fact if you're using a source control

00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:55,069
system that the rest of the planet is

00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:56,719
using you can cut and paste and steal it

00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,159
from somebody else and if you look at

00:11:56,719 --> 00:12:00,109
most websites that's exactly what

00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,429
they've done now remember when you do

00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:02,749
cut and paste and steal from other

00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,219
websites make sure you put the name of

00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:06,769
your project in there as opposed to

00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:09,379
theirs because because it's awesome to

00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,029
see that you you know your your source

00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,039
control repository the clone command

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,569
actually you know checks out openoffice

00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,649
and nobody wants to get that surprise

00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:21,559
when they actually you know now the

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:23,509
source control can go wild if you have

00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,419
written your own source control system

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:32,119
for this project and the project is not

00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:35,989
a source control system you get 30

00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:38,209
points but even more if you don't

00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:41,149
actually use the existing public source

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:44,659
control you get 50 points and you think

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,979
nobody does that but but they do they've

00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,599
got the source control that's up there

00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:49,519
and there's no commits for the last four

00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:52,099
years and you think oh this projects

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,509
dead well no says the maintainer you

00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:59,599
just need to download my code from the

00:12:53,509 --> 00:13:01,669
web forum what building from source is

00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:03,709
the next thing now code that doesn't

00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:06,879
build is usually worse than no code at

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:09,889
all so if you don't have any

00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,659
documentation to tell me who's looking

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,059
at your code for the very first time how

00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:16,219
to build your project from source you

00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,409
get 20 points and an additional 10

00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:19,969
points if it doesn't work it's the

00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,679
documentation that you wrote five years

00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:23,149
ago hasn't been updated and doesn't take

00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,619
into account that now you use make

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:29,479
instead of whatever build system

00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:31,699
scripting you had jury-rigged before you

00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:33,589
you're turning me away at the gate when

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:36,559
you do these sorts of mistakes and I

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:38,630
know it's tempting to say I'm a coder I

00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,050
don't write documentation you know

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,610
look how AM world am I ever supposed to

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,380
get involved in your project in any

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,660
meaningful way if I can't build it from

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,310
source and you might say well most users

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,780
won't build it from source but again we

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,990
go back to the beginning part of my deck

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,900
not the cloud part but and we say we

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,400
want contributors not just users so keep

00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,720
that in mind because the user will never

00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,250
make a jump to a contributor if they

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,120
never are able to build from source

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,250
configuring is also important because

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,750
building is great but most people want

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,760
to make a change here or there they want

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,880
to tune something they want to disable a

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,900
library they want to add a feature so if

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,230
your source is configured by a

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:22,030
handwritten shell script 1992 is calling

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,890
and they like you back it's a bad thing

00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,390
editing flat text config files oh that's

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,960
even worse you get 20 points for that

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:33,140
one manually editing code header files

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,340
gets you 30 points there are some unix

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,810
companies that would like you to come

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,480
work for them if this is your idea of

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,760
configuration now if your source isn't

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,170
configurable at all you get 50 points

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,460
because that means you've decided that

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:49,700
the code was perfect before anybody

00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:52,700
touched it build tools now I'm not here

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,100
to tell you what build tools to use as

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,270
long as you're not using something

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,590
besides can you make if your source

00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,730
builds using something that is in canoe

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,130
make you just go ahead and take ten

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,950
points off the top because 75% of your

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,180
audience is expecting that make is going

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,040
to work because that's what we've been

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,810
conditioned to know and there are ways

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,490
around that I don't care if you have 14

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,280
other ways to build the code janu make

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,110
should be one of them but if your source

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,020
only builds with third-party proprietary

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:27,290
build tools I don't know you know

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:28,790
Microsoft Visual Studio 50 points if you

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,200
wrote your own build tool for this code

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,610
you get a hundred points you just got in

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,960
the wrong direction you you're so deep

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,340
in this hole I don't even think I can

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,910
throw a rope long enough to get you out

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:42,860
of here and yet this happens on a

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,330
frequent basis when you reading the

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,910
build instructions which are hopefully

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,500
there and it says you know make is

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,480
terrible I hate make and here's a

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,370
14-page dry a tribe about how make is

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:59,120
terrible but I built something work

00:15:52,370 --> 00:16:00,650
so please use that that's when my blood

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,839
starts to boil and I start to back away

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:08,360
slowly bundling now if your source

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,910
includes copies of other code projects

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,200
it depends on you get 20 points and you

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,960
might think but what if somebody doesn't

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,940
have z lib I hate to break it to you but

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,830
we all have Z live at this point there's

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,960
no need for you to include a copy of Z

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,610
live with their we're good and if you

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,470
really think we don't have a copy of z

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,750
lib your documentation should say you

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,020
need z lib to run this go get z lib from

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,880
here because we all have z lib and if

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,950
it's something so and terribly obscure

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,600
that you think no one will possibly have

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,220
it on their system or possibly be able

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,630
to download it or possibly be able to

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,700
build it without me hand holding them

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,890
through the entire process don't use it

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm sure that this great library that

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:51,170
you found that somebody ported from BSD

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,520
to Linux in 1999 that hasn't been

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,140
touched since then seems like the

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,700
perfect fit for what you're doing but

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,320
you're just you're setting yourselves up

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,680
to become ugly before you even become

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,750
pretty don't bundle other pieces of code

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,490
and of course the argument is is what

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,030
about Windows what Windows doesn't have

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,010
all these things have a documentation

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,929
that says how to build for windows ship

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,790
a separate tarball that says for Windows

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,510
I include all the helping hands and it

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,370
became over 100 Meg's as a result if you

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,750
want to cater to that audience do it in

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,829
a separate way that doesn't affect the

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,829
rest of us that are normal

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,890
if your code cannot be built without

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,290
first building the bundled code bits you

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,850
get 10 points again we all have z lib we

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,410
don't need you to build our copy just to

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,710
discover that our copy is just as good

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:41,290
and if you've modified the bundled code

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,450
bits you really don't understand what

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,250
open source is supposed to be about open

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,530
source is about finding bugs and things

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,299
that you use sending the fixes to the

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,010
upstream having the upstream sanity

00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:53,590
check that you're not writing complete

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,809
crack code accepting those changes into

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,549
the library and then being able to use

00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:59,350
that system copy across the board

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,419
because you think it's not a big deal

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,740
I'll just bundle a copy of z lib I'll

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,230
make the changes in here that I think

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,660
are reasonable or if we're Debian fans

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,860
hey I fixed this bug in openssl no one

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:16,120
will notice if I just carry it around

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:18,100
forever again on a one project thing it

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,540
doesn't seem like such a bad idea but

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,970
when you get on the distribution scale

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,830
and I'm pulling 14 copies of Z live out

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,360
of your thing because every library you

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,280
pulled into bundle thought it was okay

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,169
for them to also pull in Z lib I've

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,650
pulled four copies of zeal about of

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:31,650
chromium

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,860
now libraries libraries are good they're

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,940
nice you should read in them but that's

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,800
not what I'm talking about I'm talking

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,170
about the libraries that your code

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,120
builds so that you think hey I've

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,580
written this set of functionality other

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,260
programs might like to use it I'm going

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,020
to make it available as a library if

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,929
your code only builds static libraries

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,309
you get a plus 20 points now there's

00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:59,530
this argument that I've heard from

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:03,880
various academics and idiots that is

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:07,570
that static libraries make things go

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,210
faster that hasn't been true since 2000

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,740
on Linux even less on other UNIX a--'s

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,710
that were smart enough to realize this

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,080
there is no real benefit to building

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,520
static unless you're building pre-built

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,380
binaries for somebody to carry around

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,570
and if you want to do that that's fine

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,390
do it on your own time don't force me to

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,920
do it now if your code could build

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,380
shared libraries but only on version

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,300
ones you're just not thinking about a

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,250
big picture environment here and it's

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,710
not terribly hard there are tools like

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,210
libtool and I know libtool eats babies

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,420
just don't stand too close to it while

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,429
you're doing it you can make your code

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,350
build version shared libraries and

00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:45,940
everybody is happy you're happy your

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,100
users are happy there's no random

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,960
conflicts when Oracle comes along and

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,460
barfs files all over your system and the

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,140
name of putting a database there and

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,880
suddenly you discover that the system

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,650
library you thought was there and was

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,040
intact because you didn't put a version

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,900
on it got obliterated by a ten-year-old

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,170
copy that has bugs in it because they

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,610
patched in the bundled version now the

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,140
last part about libraries if your code

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,630
doesn't actually try to use the existing

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,100
system libraries we go to great lengths

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,750
in fedora and I'm sure the other

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,940
distributions do too but I can't speak

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,920
for them to make sure that the libraries

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,650
that we ship are moderately unbroken

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:24,490
they don't suck terribly they usually

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:26,350
work they're kind of pretty take

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,140
advantage of the work that we put into

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,050
making those libraries go don't assume

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,760
that we're going to get it wrong because

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:38,350
we shipped a bogus compiler and Red Hat

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:41,080
Linux 6 dot to try to use the existing

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:44,890
system libraries at a very minimum it is

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,549
very simple to check try to compiled a

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,019
small piece of code against the library

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:51,779
function that you're worried might not

00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,759
work if it fails bail out and say hey

00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:57,360
your library that ons on the system is

00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,889
utter and total crap hey no skin off my

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,629
back if it doesn't work for you let me

00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,190
know but don't assume before we get that

00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:08,309
far that it's not going to work because

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:10,619
it probably will system install your

00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,809
code forces it install into / opt or

00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:16,679
user local it probably comes with a

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:19,649
license key that's not the way to do it

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,350
I mean let the let the defaults be

00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:24,090
saying I mean we have a set of file

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,279
system hierarchy that everybody knows

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:29,009
that everybody expects don't be crazy

00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:32,309
don't be wacky just just use the default

00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:34,169
paths and roll with it if your cook

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,179
doesn't have a make install I really

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,009
wonder how they expect anyone to

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,169
actually install their code because if

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,609
you generate one binary okay I got a

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:43,679
lucky guess as to what i should be

00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:45,840
putting in the user been but when

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,369
there's 175 files that get dumped into

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,859
the top level source directory as a

00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:51,149
result of the build okay do i copy all

00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,179
of these where do i put them where

00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:55,529
should they go but of course you're

00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,019
looking at the last item on this slide

00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:01,259
which is your code does not work outside

00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:03,269
of the source directory so very quickly

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,759
those 20 points have turned into 50

00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,470
points because you don't ever intend

00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,359
anyone to install this on a system it's

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,970
okay for to live and run and be happy

00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,679
inside of its little directory but five

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,720
years later when you've gone crazy and

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,249
they've replaced you somebody comes

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,929
along and discovers the system that's

00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:21,929
very crucial to the company's business

00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:23,609
and where does that thing live where

00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:25,679
does it run from it must be in user been

00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:29,119
all things are in user been no it's it's

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,379
not an user been it's somewhere else and

00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,149
everything is somewhere else and the

00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:36,499
proliferation of somewhere else's makes

00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:39,629
the system look like a minefield and so

00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:41,669
go ahead teach your code how to install

00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:43,679
somewhere identify what files are

00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:46,950
relevant in an installed environment and

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,320
if you must also support it running out

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:55,019
of that directory go nuts but just don't

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:59,070
make that be the only option now we

00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:02,570
start to get into the weird stuff and if

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,890
your code uses windows line breaks

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,270
not only am i frightened because I

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:12,179
realize you're writing for linux on a

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:13,980
Windows machine just that's that is that

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,480
that tells me that I don't want to look

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,880
any farther when I opened it up in the

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,260
text editor and emacs or film says I had

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,460
to convert this so you could read it

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,380
well alright you know and that's that's

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,270
when the little part of me starts

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,640
screaming inside as loud as it possibly

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,380
can now if your hood actually depends on

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,730
specific compiler features I do

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,370
appreciate that you took the time to

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,570
tell me this that happens one out of

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,610
every hundred times when this is

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,260
actually in play the other 99 percent of

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,330
the time I discover that when you know

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,940
I'm on a more modern compiler than the

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,990
one that you used eg CS has not existed

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,610
for a very long time depending on

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,080
specific compiler bugs is even more fun

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,940
there's nothing that's greater than

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,919
opening a piece of code that says please

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,760
don't build this with a modern GCC we're

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,860
dependent on a bug now if you depend on

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,110
Microsoft Visual anything for your code

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,720
to actually build it compile well you

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:10,730
don't understand linux and perhaps you

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,169
you've missed the point now

00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,820
communication going beyond just code

00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:17,400
oddities and things that make me cry

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,559
myself to sleep if your project does not

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,610
announce releases on a mailing list they

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:26,280
did not happen no one will know that you

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,230
released them you can announce in 16

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,970
other ways but at a bare minimum you

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,440
need to go to the effort of having a

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,049
mailing list where you announce things

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,179
it can be an announced mailing list it

00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:37,919
can be your regular mailing list it can

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,530
be a mailing list that you think no one

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,480
reads I don't care announce it on a

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,549
mailing list those of us who are trying

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,280
to maintain things in distributions like

00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,900
to know when you've updated your code we

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,490
have lots of things we're doing we're

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,580
not sitting around going to the update

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,380
did the update oh did they update

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,030
announce it put it out there will

00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,770
subscribe to mailing lists like you

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,330
won't believe just to keep track of

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,390
what's being current to look at what's

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:06,390
changing to make sure that we stay

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,830
informed but of course which brings us

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,080
to our second item which is projects

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,240
they don't have a mailing list look I'm

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,669
as web 20 or whatever is the next guy

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,180
but you do need to have a mailing list

00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:17,580
it

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,230
web forum while great and awesome and

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,700
fun is not a replacement for a mailing

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,560
list and there will be people who will

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,050
steadfastly refuse to use the mailing

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,810
list that's fine you still need to have

00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,270
one now if you don't have a bug tracker

00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:33,360
I'm starting to wonder if you want

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:36,120
contributors because the lowest and

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,210
simplest form of contributor is someone

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,350
as a user who says something is broken

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:45,840
and I wanted to tell you about it

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,760
because that is the minimum amount that

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,230
anyone can contribute to a project is to

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,660
tell them hey this things on fire and if

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,000
I can't figure out how to tell you that

00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,100
your codes on fire there is no way I

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,850
will ever contribute to it beyond that

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:07,770
point if you don't have a website what

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:08,910
and yet there are plenty of projects

00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,950
where someone has said hey could you

00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,180
package this up for fedora I go sure to

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,740
go learn more about it and they go oh

00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,610
there's no website it's in an ftp

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,290
directory all right we're just racking

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,420
up the points you're just scoring lots

00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,900
of points here now if your project is

00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,070
sourceforge vaporware you've got lots of

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,140
ports already but you get a hundred

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,030
bonus points for that because I I think

00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,890
it's a great idea that you've built a

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:37,170
video editing tool that has no code but

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:39,090
uh good luck with that versioning on

00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,040
releases again we're assuming you've

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,440
done releases because otherwise you know

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,910
you're just getting all these points but

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,640
if your project does not do sanely

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,500
version releases major and minor you get

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,470
10 points and you think what everybody

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,910
is doing sanely version releases know

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,010
there's a gentleman who I maintain some

00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,590
packages some code in packages for

00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,220
fedora who releases everything in dot

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,570
zip files that are named project zip and

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,370
every time he doesn't update he makes a

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,930
new project zip and he overwrites the

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:10,410
one that was in the same place before

00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,270
and I've tried to explain to him look

00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,160
this is really confusing for me because

00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,600
I have to check some every time I go to

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,130
see if you've gotten a new one and and

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,480
that seems like a bad approach because

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,280
you just shove a version in there

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,420
somewhere i mean i don't i'm not even

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,460
going to ask you to put a nice version

00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,130
in there just some version you can be a

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,810
new name

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,730
every time you can you can call it Frank

00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,860
you can call it Suzie but it's something

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,360
and he goes I don't see what your

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:40,600
problem is you should just be watching

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:45,100
to see when I upload this kit doesn't

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:48,340
have a lot of community and and so you

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,680
don't version your releases much less

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,810
sanely then you're you're at the

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,320
20-point spectrum there if you don't do

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,520
releases 50 points and this is sometimes

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,140
a controversial point because we have a

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,210
lot of people that say you know the

00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,930
github model is a good way to work I'm

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,340
always just going to commit things and

00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,680
to get I'm just going to keep moving

00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,030
fast fast fast fast you can ride along

00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,380
with me if you want but I'm not gonna

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:16,260
slow down for you long enough to make a

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,260
release that's stupid I mean

00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:26,970
be realistic people want to know hey I'm

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,850
running this version and at some point

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,980
you need to say what version are you

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,150
running it's on fire but what version

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,710
are you running and you don't want

00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:37,740
people to say the one I built from get

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,300
yesterday which provision forget did you

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,340
build yesterday I don't know the one I

00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,200
built from get yesterday if you put

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,030
versions on things and there are version

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,560
versions then people have something to

00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,150
fall back on you can say at this point

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,360
in time it works at this point in time

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,190
it does not okay well what about tagging

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,130
what if I just tagged aggressively and

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,840
get that's better than nothing sure but

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,440
go the extra step take the 10 more

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,760
seconds to have it be a release to have

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,410
it be a release file and if you're on a

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,030
nice place like github and you make a

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,920
tag github will be nice enough to offer

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,840
that tag up as a download so you don't

00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,850
even have to do it if you're on a good

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,980
place like that but if you're not again

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,860
take the 10 seconds put the release out

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,310
there your users will start to thank you

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,380
and not be frightened of you now if you

00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:29,310
only releases attachments and web forum

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:30,900
posts you might be 12 I'm not sure I and

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,930
there's nothing nothing against a 12

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,850
year old that writes awesome code but

00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,410
that's not a way to distribute in a

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,200
meaningful way to build community

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,240
because you're on page 34 and is that

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,310
the most recent one or is it on page 12

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,450
in this forum thread of doom where all

00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:51,390
these people are talking about how

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:52,980
awesome the code is releases in format

00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,750
if your release is there only in zip

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,610
format you get five points that's not

00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,050
fatal I mean that just means you haven't

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,290
been outside lately you haven't looked

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:03,030
on the internet if your releases their

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,470
only plus 10 points you haven't left the

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,510
apple store in a while because you're

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,760
still using OS X compatible zip files

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,990
and I mean you really haven't left the

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,110
apple store in a while because they

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:15,600
fixed that a while ago I mean if you're

00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,680
only an AR AR format well I mean you

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,080
might be Russian then there's a lot of

00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,650
Russians to do that I can't explain that

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,780
but if you're only an AR j format man

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,050
that is some awesome doom wad you've got

00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,130
there but

00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:32,230
I don't know that that's code now if

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,660
it's only an encapsulation format that

00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,700
you invented you get a hundred points

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:43,540
and at this point normally somebody goes

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:45,250
that's BS nobody does that there was a

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,480
piece of software and somebody said hey

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,460
I'm having trouble figuring how to

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,610
package this and I said okay and I said

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,100
I can't forgot to get it open so I go to

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,300
his website and I find the contact for

00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,590
the author and I sent him an emo and I

00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,060
say hey I'd like to look at your code

00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,350
but it can't figure out how to open it

00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:03,250
and he's like that's because I've

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,590
improved the compression and I said

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,770
really I said okay well I'm still

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:10,420
following and and how do I open this and

00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,160
he goes well you download this binary on

00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,600
my website and it will open up for you

00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,280
and I said no offense to you but I don't

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,960
trust your random binary and I don't

00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,250
want to run it to open something else

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,720
that I'm not sure what's inside of it

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,470
this seems like a whole lot of fail on

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,940
my part and he says dude don't worry I

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,720
have source over here you could open

00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,720
this up and build it

00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,480
need I explain how that failed no no no

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,250
just download the binary to unpack the

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,360
source to build the binary to unpack the

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:46,190
source to build the binary there's so

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,260
many snakes eating their own tail there

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,760
it's just like four snakes and needless

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,960
to say that did not get packaged for

00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,910
fedora unpacking things now if your

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,710
releases do not unpacked into a version

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,920
top level directory and I provide an

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,780
example G Lib C dash two for two that's

00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,450
a version top level directory if your

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,220
package does not do that you get 10

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:14,360
points to fail because I can figure it

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:17,330
out if you went back into /p lube see if

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,500
you fail at that then you get 25 points

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,880
to fail because now I'm having to figure

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,570
out where in the world did this thing

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,520
unpack now I even I don't even give you

00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,780
points to fail to naming on the tarball

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,730
is different from the naming of the

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,110
directory I'm a smart enough guy that

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,670
I'll probably be able to figure this out

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:35,960
after saying a couple choice words about

00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:37,760
your heritage but if you unpack it to an

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,200
absurd number of useless directories

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,400
that leads me to believe that you don't

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,690
know how to use your computer like say

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,590
home John Doe GMC svn Tarbell gob source

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,060
bonus points for using the same

00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,110
directory twice in the structure by the

00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,539
way

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,490
50 points because I'm never going to

00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:58,720
find that thing never ever in a million

00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,950
years is that going to come out of my

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
directory if I showed you my home

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,929
director you'd be horrified but I'm

00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,760
still not going to find this thing now

00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:09,490
forking now here's where I say some more

00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,440
controversial things if your code is a

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,020
fork of another project you get 10

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,700
points of fail and you say but but but

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,630
but but I needed a de fort there was all

00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:22,809
these extenuating circumstances no

00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:26,260
forking is good as a concept it is good

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:30,279
that we can fork if we need to you don't

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:34,029
need to one out of every thousand

00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,039
projects has a valid fork for it a fork

00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:38,080
where there was a good reason it was

00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,850
solidified by other good reasons and

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,580
they all lined up and said we're with

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,110
you let's do it but if your primary

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,610
developers were not involved with the

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,679
parent project in any meaningful way

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,539
that's not a good fork I've never seen

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,429
any successful fork where a whole bunch

00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:53,429
of random people said you guys are dumb

00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:00,059
we can do it better I've never seen any

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,220
successful work like that never not once

00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,870
I come across and half of their code has

00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,879
been removed and replaced with net and

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:15,570
you're like whoa okay hmm that started

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:18,270
out as Python huh sometimes forking is

00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:20,609
necessary but it isn't really not

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,960
usually not almost ever and again the

00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:24,899
counter examples here that people go

00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,879
what about LibreOffice yes LibreOffice

00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:28,859
made sense there was a giant crowd of

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,510
people screaming this is a bad idea we

00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:35,659
need to get off this boat it's burning

00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:39,000
and sinking at the same time you know

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,770
and again and i'm not i'm not going to

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:48,149
say too many names here oracle but i

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:50,070
mean you're walking around with a gas

00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:56,700
can and a flamethrower no wonder

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:59,490
everybody wants off the boat history now

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,109
until open sourcing it and and hopefully

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,460
you you started out open source and this

00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:04,770
isn't a concern for you because you were

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,290
smart but if your code was proprietary

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,510
at any point in its history you'd start

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,690
to rack up some fail points you know one

00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:16,350
to two years is 10 3 to 5 years is 26 to

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,850
10 is 30 10 plusses 50 points and you

00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,619
might think this doesn't happen but it

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:23,460
does and it's very prevalent in

00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,780
educational code where ten years ago

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,550
they wrote this code and they had the

00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,600
grand idea of this professor of not

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,800
having to work at this terrible

00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,770
university with all these terrible

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,600
children that hate him and he's going to

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,030
strike it rich what everybody realizes

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,570
this for trade 77 code he wrote is going

00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:42,420
to be a jackpot of money and then 10

00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,619
years later crying at home he open

00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,520
sources it and uploads it to the

00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:51,210
Internet nothing good comes from that

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,700
I don't care if that code could cause

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,880
you know hunger to go away and world

00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,230
peace to spring out of it no one's going

00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,550
to be able to build it no one's going to

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,620
be able to package it there will never

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,600
be a community around it anyone who

00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:09,270
opens it will feel like they opened the

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,550
Ark of the Covenant you cannot change

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,710
the past but you may be doomed to fail

00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,400
because of this and I want to make this

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,050
point because too often proprietary

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,910
software companies think they're doing a

00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:26,250
good thing for the open source community

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:28,860
by dropping floaters on us hey you

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:32,790
wanted us to open source that here you

00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:36,300
go there comes a point in time in which

00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:38,310
you think this is not good code no one

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,080
that works on this code works on it for

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:45,150
any other reason other than that we pay

00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:48,660
them or they're locked in the room we

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,730
should bury it in the backyard put up a

00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,420
nice memorial to it have people come and

00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:56,730
wail over it and let it go at a certain

00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,590
point in codes life the points of fail

00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,950
that it gathers by being open sourced

00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:04,710
outweigh anything anyone will ever get

00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,690
from it I speak from experience Red Hat

00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,330
has bought some terrible terrible

00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,790
terrible code and every now and then

00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:14,820
someone comes along and says hey what

00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:17,210
happened to the Netscape email server we

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,210
shot it

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:26,190
you're welcome now licensing again I

00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,810
didn't mention on the legal guy not a

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,280
lawyer I won't go too hard on you folks

00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,110
but if your code doesn't have her file

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,120
licensing you get 10 points to fail and

00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,070
you should think very hard about it I

00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,020
don't care how unimportant you think

00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,120
that single piece of code is put a per

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,640
file license on it that can be as simple

00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,710
as a comment that says this code is bsd

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,970
or this code is under the same license

00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,400
file as a text file in the main

00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,780
directory I prefer you be specific but

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,970
if you give me some idea of what this

00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,460
piece of code is it's good the problem

00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:56,550
is is that in 1989's unreleased code

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,260
onto usenet and they didn't put a good

00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,510
license tag on it it wasn't quite clear

00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,850
what the license was on it and that code

00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,230
ended up in everything people picked it

00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,710
up and carried it around and put it in

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:10,050
places and in 2010 we finally got the

00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:14,760
last of it eradicated from Linux it was

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:16,230
in the kernel your code moves if you

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,730
write good code it will move if you

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:22,440
write bad code you don't to worry about

00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:24,510
it but hopefully but I mean ode moves

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,890
people pick it up they go hey I really

00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,180
like the way you did that foo in that

00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,010
bar and I don't want to write a few in a

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,450
bar so i'm going to pick up your 1c file

00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,950
and I'm going to pull it in my

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,510
distribution again if you're doing

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,670
libraries you avoid this you minimize

00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,920
this but I know I'm being realistic here

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,920
so just put a profile license on it so

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,210
when I come across it 20 years after you

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,440
wrote it and you don't want to talk to

00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,440
me about it because you're still having

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,910
the shakes and rocking back and forth I

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,440
have an idea of what the license is on

00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,780
it and whether we can continue to use it

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,420
now if the licenses in your own code

00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:58,860
conflict with each other well you

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,320
started to make some pretty big mistakes

00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:03,900
there and again this is this is when the

00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,360
V legal part of me is crying out and

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,220
begging for mercy but again you as the

00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,950
copyright holder can do whatever you

00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,870
want you can put joke licenses on your

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:15,360
code you can make it so that no one

00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:18,120
whose not named Brad Pitt can use your

00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,560
code it's fine you're perfectly entitled

00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,940
do that it doesn't affect you in the

00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,370
slightest the rest of us in the real

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,170
world are affected by that now when the

00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:27,480
licenses in your code directly conflict

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,100
no distribution that's doing license

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,720
checking in any level is going to carry

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,650
it because it means we have

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,270
this entirely incompatible ball of stuff

00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,590
now it's pretty hard to actually pull

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,670
this off unless you're aggressively

00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,980
bundling which we talked about before

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:44,130
and you shouldn't be doing that so you

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,630
know I just realize that there are

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,570
licenses that are out there that are

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,920
incompatible with the GPL there are

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,590
quite a few of them they're incompatible

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,240
with the GPL and you know for various

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,440
reasons that's a good and a bad thing

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,000
and I'm not going to lecture about that

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,050
at you you can get that from the Free

00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,400
Software Foundation if you want but just

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:06,330
take the moment to look over what you've

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,099
got and documented take 10 minutes worst

00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,099
case because you don't have more than

00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:13,320
100 megs of code right take 10 minutes

00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:14,910
look at all the licenses write them all

00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,750
down see if there are any potential

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,369
conflicts if you're not sure ask there

00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,160
are plenty of people and places that

00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:24,869
will happily say you have a conflict or

00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,220
you don't have a conflict you can get

00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:27,930
lawyers that will tell you this for free

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,410
because they like having not to clean

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,090
this up later now if your code doesn't

00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,400
contain any notice of licensing intent

00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,920
man that just how do I know what your

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,420
license is I have no idea and the

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,920
problem is is that a lot of hackers and

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,980
a lot of open source projects that mean

00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,599
well assume that by not wasting time

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,310
putting a license on it that people can

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,859
do whatever they want but it doesn't

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,420
work that way in the United States and

00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:54,000
in every other country that has signed

00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,970
the Berne Convention copyright holder

00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,390
gains all rights user only gains a

00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:02,790
limited right to use by default that's

00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,470
it nothing else is granted by default

00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,750
everything else must be explicitly

00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,089
granted by the copyright holder you have

00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,640
to tell me what I can do besides limited

00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:14,250
use so by not putting a license on your

00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,160
work it tells me I can do nothing but

00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:20,940
use and in some jurisdictions this may

00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,980
mean I can't even build your code take

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,619
10 seconds pick a license put it on

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,790
there a bad license on the code is worse

00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,770
than no license but utterly unclear

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,540
licensing means that no distribution

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,180
will touch it we will back away now

00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,400
patient distributions like fedora will

00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,200
ask please tell us what the licenses on

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,339
that and if you're still alive that's

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,500
great it's good to get an answer from

00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,400
you I mean and but in cases where you've

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,990
moved on or

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,579
you've changed email addresses six times

00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:52,020
or your email address doesn't have an at

00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:54,270
symbol in it we have no way to contact

00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,170
you we can't find you I mean one of the

00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,480
things that we're doing right now in

00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:00,240
fedora is we are auditing a big

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,690
repository of code called tech life you

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,849
may have heard of it we have over a

00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,619
hundred and seventy-five components that

00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:11,609
we cannot determine the license for and

00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:13,130
they're kind of important half of them

00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,299
we can't determine who wrote them

00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,430
they're not documented there's no

00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:20,130
attribution of who wrote this code so we

00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,480
can't figure out who to ask we're doing

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,160
the best that we can to try and track

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,559
these people down and it's a long and

00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,890
tedious process but you can save

00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,710
everyone that pain later by being clear

00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:33,690
and including some notice of licensing

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,730
intent something that gives us an idea

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,010
of who wrote it and what the license is

00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:42,059
and I realized I'm beating this into the

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,500
ground I hope it sticks now if your code

00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,319
doesn't include a copy of the license

00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,789
text you said Hayes is code license now

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,339
if you if you say this is GPL and you

00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:53,130
forget to include a copy of the GPL

00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:54,630
everybody knows what you mean almost no

00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,220
court and I say almost no court but

00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,420
almost no court is going to get to a

00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,309
point where you're in front of a judge

00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,990
and the judge goes well I don't know it

00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:05,819
could be the good for public license but

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:09,829
it's places when you see things like the

00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:12,750
full moon license and it's not there or

00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:16,190
this code is under the license specified

00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:19,650
by copying and copying is not there I

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,940
have no idea what copying was be let me

00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,460
let me randomly look through my system

00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,369
oh there's 175 copies of copying and

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,569
they're all different now of course if

00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:29,640
your code doesn't have a license 100

00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:31,349
points you know because you decided that

00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,220
you don't want there to be a license

00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:36,950
because you hate licenses you're doing

00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,329
it wrong I hate to tell you this but

00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,670
there's almost no situations in which an

00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:44,670
unlicensed consciously unlicensed piece

00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:47,190
of code is a good idea public domain is

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:48,900
very complicated it's very screwy and

00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,859
yes I know the sequel that guy here is

00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,230
here but public domain is a bad idea for

00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,579
almost everyone unless you are a full

00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,960
time employee of the government and have

00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,599
no choice

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,030
don't public domain your code or if you

00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,160
must insist that it's public domain put

00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,720
a license on it too and say if public

00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,609
domain works for you it's public domain

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,740
if it's not it's this license give us a

00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:12,270
choice because in lots of places around

00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,520
the world public durham domain

00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:17,550
declarations don't work they do in the

00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,310
united states in general but in most of

00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,570
europe they don't and for fedora which

00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,800
is international and trying to be

00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,640
friendly to other people in other

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,290
countries we have these problems and and

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,520
i think the problem is is that people in

00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,810
the u.s. write a piece of code and they

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,330
put it under public domain because they

00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:35,070
can and it's reasonably okay and then

00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,810
someone in europe sees that and tries to

00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,369
do the same thing but they can't they

00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,080
can't legally put something under the

00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:44,550
public domain they cannot abandon their

00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,680
copyright and then we get something from

00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,180
france where three guys from france

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,740
wrote a piece of code together and they

00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,210
put it in the public domain and their

00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,880
own government won't recognize as being

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,260
in the public domain no one in the EU

00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,000
will recognize it as being the public

00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,830
domain in the US wants to keep treaties

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,930
intact and thus won't recognize it in

00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,160
the public domain and I can't find these

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,510
three Frenchman to get them to figure

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,540
out what the license to be on this code

00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:09,420
so just just put a license on there we

00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,130
are tracking hundreds of licenses in

00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,839
fedora we have a nifty little table that

00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,880
describes them all and where I say

00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:16,619
occasionally nasty things about them you

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,960
can pick any one of these licenses and

00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,430
just use it and if you really really

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,869
really want to write a new license

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,099
against my better judgment will look at

00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:26,430
it and determine whether it's acceptable

00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:28,230
but put one on there because code

00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,780
without a license on a conscious

00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:35,790
decision is very very very harming to

00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:38,550
your community speaking of harming your

00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:40,619
community copyright assignment if

00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,390
contributing to your codebase requires

00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,680
explicit copyright assignment on the

00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,140
part of the contributor you are

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,520
seriously failing you're getting a

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,619
hundred points of fail right out of the

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,180
gate now if you're the Free Software

00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:52,770
Foundation you can minus ten points

00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,359
because they kind of have a little text

00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,520
in there that says that we only do this

00:45:54,359 --> 00:46:00,420
to make sure that will always be free

00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:02,520
and that's pretty in hippie-ish and I

00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,170
you know I give them a little bit of

00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,930
leeway on that but at the end of the day

00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,940
if your code requires copyright

00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:12,020
assignment for people to contribute and

00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,940
be involved in it you are doing it wrong

00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,710
nobody needs that there is a difference

00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,360
between copyright assignment forcing

00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,630
people to take their rights and give

00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:24,780
them to you and asking them for sane

00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:26,610
licensing permission plenty of projects

00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:30,540
do reasonable licensing permission

00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:33,480
Apache Perl Python all of these guys

00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,610
saying reasonable licensing permission

00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,380
requests in fact I will go so far as to

00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,420
say there are only two legitimate but

00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,750
poor reasons for a copyright assignment

00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:45,750
requirement you intend to make the code

00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:48,450
proprietary you want to be able to add a

00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,730
moment's notice cash out and make the

00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:54,990
big bucks off your Fortran 77 pile of

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:56,910
stuff or you intend to sell the code to

00:46:54,990 --> 00:47:00,900
someone else or use it as intellectual

00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:03,870
property to help sell your company no

00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,180
healthy open source free project should

00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:09,480
have either of those motivations at all

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:12,150
ever that's not to say you can't make

00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,800
money off your Foss but you shouldn't be

00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,540
looking at proprietor izing it you

00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,190
shouldn't be looking at it as an IP to

00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,740
help you sell your company to someone

00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,660
else there's no other good reason the

00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,010
arguments of I need your copyright to

00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:27,660
protect you in court bogus absolute crap

00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,070
every single GPL enforcement case in the

00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,420
United States has been brought up has

00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:31,860
not been brought up by a single

00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,480
copyright holder that had copyright

00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,790
across the entire work and they've

00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,610
succeeded lawyers are settling it's

00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:40,230
worked in Germany everywhere everybody

00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,660
recognizes that these sorts of things

00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,880
are multiple copyright holder situations

00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:49,860
you do not need to be the only copyright

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,360
holder in play to win a lawsuit so I

00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,860
mean all you will do is you will get

00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,180
people who will want to invest their

00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:58,710
time their brains their hours the things

00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,650
they know the things they learn the

00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,360
things they do and help you work

00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,310
together to make something great with

00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,020
things is to have a clear statement of

00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,930
licensing intent from your contributors

00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:12,390
so that you and your contributors that

00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:14,760
hold copyright are all on the same page

00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:17,250
about the license of the work so that if

00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,890
you have to go to court you stand

00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:22,430
together and not requiring that it be

00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,430
one person

00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:32,180
we talked about that afterwards but what

00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:32,180
I disagree yes

00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:53,180
yeah so the question was is what about

00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,980
things that are you know like like Perl

00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,650
and Python that have built in ways to

00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,210
build the dart make and to be fair those

00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,069
are those are reasonable things to

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,720
expect if the community expectation

00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:05,000
around a piece of code based on its

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,710
language is that it isn't make that it

00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,849
is this other thing then I would argue

00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,890
that it's points to fail if you've

00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:11,960
migrated away from that expectation if

00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:15,380
someone checks out something from C pad

00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,180
and you know does the regular pearl in

00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,769
vacations and magic to make it billed as

00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,170
every other pearl component in Sipan

00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:22,549
does and it doesn't work that way then

00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,829
you fail because that's the expectation

00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:28,670
but for things that aren't in those

00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:32,660
specific pearl or Python cases and their

00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:35,119
C or C++ code that isn't make ified it

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,710
doesn't work with make then that's when

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,200
that comes into play those are clear

00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:55,789
exceptions that I think don't cause you

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:58,099
stress or fail points yes no I don't

00:49:55,789 --> 00:50:00,319
think the question was is a what about a

00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:01,430
host encoder google code do we need to

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,440
have a separate website for that and I

00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,000
would say no as long as you are treating

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,859
it like a website and not as a code

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,150
dumping ground because there are lots of

00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:12,109
projects that are on google code where

00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:14,630
they say code that does crypto click

00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:17,509
here to download that's not good that's

00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:19,819
not a website but if you fill it out and

00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:21,230
you flush it out and you use the fact

00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:23,359
that the Google Code hosting facility

00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,099
has a built-in wiki has a built-in tree

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,230
for documentation has a page to let you

00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:28,789
describe it in detail you fill in all

00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,829
the fields so that when I go to it on

00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:32,450
the front page I not only have a very

00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:34,670
good idea of what your code is how it's

00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:36,440
built what it does how it works how to

00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,970
start moving along with it that

00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:44,329
accomplishes the same goal as a separate

00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:45,859
website you don't need one all right why

00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:47,059
don't see anything else so it's on to

00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:49,839
the drinking thank you very much I
