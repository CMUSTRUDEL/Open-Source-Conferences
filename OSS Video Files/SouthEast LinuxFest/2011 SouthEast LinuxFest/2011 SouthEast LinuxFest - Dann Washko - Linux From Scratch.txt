the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,870
at the 2011 southeast linux Fest in

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370
Spartanburg South Carolina it is

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,180
to take the following diamond and

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,349
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,349
make these videos possible

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:52,000
keep clapping okay I'll do a little bit

00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,190
of housekeeping stuff really quick

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,780
things first off the pirate symbol in

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,760
the back has nothing at all to do with

00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,980
my talk it's just a holdover from an old

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,860
work talk and I'm too lazy to change the

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,520
slide background so and I noticed that I

00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,510
look at it um my name is Dan wash go you

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,060
might have heard me from the Winx

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,340
lynktec show you might have heard part

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,170
of this talk on the linux latex show but

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,300
before I get started I'm just curious

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,960
how many people in here have been using

00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,790
Linux more than five years and how many

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,600
people are have been using Linux less

00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,550
than three years and how many people

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,729
have used anything other than who bunts

00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:34,570
it okay pretty good anybody use slack

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:36,700
we're good good good all right hey has

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,110
anybody ever tried Linux from scratch in

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:47,229
here

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:49,210
okay good good all right well okay let's

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,810
get started then we'll roll on here now

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,360
originally my talk was slated to be

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,009
Linux from scratch but I always like to

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,250
slip Slackware and wherever I could

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,509
because I it's a great thing but so my

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,939
focus today is going to be talking about

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,579
Linux learning Linux and how I went

00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:12,489
about you know learning Linux for myself

00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:14,380
and applying it and applying it to doing

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,630
Linux from scratch which is a project

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,200
that I always wanted to try for a long

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,180
time

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,430
and I thought would be a wonderful

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,870
learning experience and to share my

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,090
experiences with you on that and how you

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,920
can get started pretty easily using

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,900
Linux from scratch okay what do I know

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
well I have a BA from psychology from

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,400
Penn State and I love people so much

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,640
that I decided to go into the computer

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,510
field

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,370
it was so yeah that there's a piece of

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,860
work there put on no yeah you know what

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:55,080
I have a lot fewer problems that's for

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:58,260
sure I'm going the wrong direction okay

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,720
I started using Linux about 1998 so I

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,850
came in after the floppy disk phase and

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,630
right around when stuff was being able

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,180
to be purchased in box sets in fact it

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,100
was around 1998 a little before when I

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,500
switched from a psychology career

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,150
getting into computers and doing brake

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,790
fix and trying to get into systems

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,390
administration I was working at a local

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,650
Staples two dead of tech bench there so

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,900
of course when you work there you have

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,240
to do those sales and that was terrible

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,440
but that's why I came upon my first copy

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,450
of Red Hat and a box set hands I had

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
been working with computers for a little

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,959
all my life of the messing around with

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,970
computers TI 99 for a was my first

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,100
computer and as I've said in the show in

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,989
the past I was not allowed to play games

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,390
on my computer I had to program

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,890
everything this my father said so I've

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,230
been working with computers and enjoying

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,769
them for a very long time until I got to

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,260
high school when you know just life took

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,150
over and females and everything else

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,220
more interesting than computers I got

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,380
back into it then after I graduated was

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,080
working a psychology field so I ended up

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,090
you know getting back into computers and

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,370
being very interested in networking and

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,670
as I as I talked with people saying you

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,310
know go do your MC se get some Windows

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,989
computers Network them together and go

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,459
from there and I was I was enjoying

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,419
myself but there was always something

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,820
missing I wanted to know how this stuff

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,890
actually worked what was going on under

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,110
the hood and I've talked with other

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,580
people you know around my peer group and

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,190
they were like yeah I'd really like to

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,169
build my own operating system or get

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,260
involved in it under the hood and when I

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,510
when I came upon Linux I had no idea

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,610
what it was I picked up the Box said I

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,720
read it it looks very interesting and I

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,669
started playing around with it and I saw

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,460
that this was gonna be a great tool to

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,550
help me fill in the gaps of the

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,380
knowledge that I'm

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,620
- I was missing and using other

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,680
operating systems and that's a gain more

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,270
knowledge there's a lot of peers that I

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,680
met do you want to share this knowledge

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,020
got involved with doing the Lehigh

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,220
Valley Linux users group and sharing our

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,290
knowledge that way and then that's how

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,630
the Linux link tech show started and

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,030
getting involved with everybody else in

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,650
the podcasting universe to come together

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,660
and find ways to actually share

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:23,400
knowledge am i right on the right slide

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:30,880
I wish this would change on both screens

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:33,700
okay okay so when people first start

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,070
with Linux of course as I did you come

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:40,360
to Linux through a Linux distribution

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,310
which is a great tool of that delivers a

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,920
functional Linux base system so I call

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,840
distribution and as I thought about this

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,660
and I've thought about it over the years

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,330
there's a few things to separate linic

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,070
different distributions from others that

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,500
I have noticed over the years and this

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,900
is just my categorization has nothing to

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,290
do with anything other than my opinion

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,150
but um I'd say look at if what I would

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,860
call kind of a first tier top tier

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,640
distribution they're usually the popular

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,370
distributions like your bun to your

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,990
fedoras opens husam and reeva these

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,360
these are great distributions that

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,740
provide a fully functional suite and

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,870
they try and make it easier for people

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,700
to administer to get going with these

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,950
distributions so you have stuff like the

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,290
Ubuntu Control Center the software

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:32,590
Center aptitude I like to lump in these

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,270
package managers in here you have system

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,300
configuration utilities anybody remember

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,310
Red Hat Linux Linux comp and we're

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,210
playing around with that YaST had in

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,280
openSUSE

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,620
and sled yet another system

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,540
administration tool and manned Reva

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,450
Linux Control Center which used to be

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,990
Drake comp this is a great place to go

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,850
in and manage your Linux systems and and

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,010
add users and do different tasks and

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,680
administrative tasks is very very nice

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,050
and very configurable but and it makes

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,189
life easier but they also can obscure

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,289
the inner workings of the system

00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,999
the simplicity upfront there's usually

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,249
some complexity in the back with how

00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:13,039
they can head it the files and manage it

00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:14,869
and it all comes back to it really comes

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,179
back to text files in the background

00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:20,029
that you don't need all these tools to

00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:23,419
do it and I wanted to learn that how to

00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,309
do that in the background um one of the

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,860
biggest examples I like to look at with

00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:30,860
complexity is if you compare like how

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,519
you manage gee comp settings as compared

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,839
to just editing a simple RC file you

00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,789
know you just a text file here's a

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,509
variable here's a value as a variable

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,059
here's a value

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:43,759
gee comp you pull up this registry type

00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:45,110
at any application and it's easy on the

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
front end but if you're try and do it

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,300
manually it's a little more complex so

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,569
the tools on the top tier distributions

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,039
I think kind of obscure some of the

00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,509
stuff that you might want to know in the

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,649
background because if these tools break

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,709
or they do something you don't expect

00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:03,289
it's good to know what exactly did these

00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:05,419
tools do in the background to make a

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,999
user to add the user to the system or to

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,429
change the configuration in a sound file

00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:13,399
or whatever and and those distributions

00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:14,899
really focus on their tools as opposed

00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,279
to telling you how to do it in the

00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,429
background not to say you can't learn

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,559
that from these distributions but that's

00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:23,719
where I come in into the second tier

00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:26,869
distributions which require a little

00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,969
more attention the Debian's the gentoos

00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:31,490
and the arch links now I love absolutely

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:33,529
love Arch Linux sir oh you're raising

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,539
your hand just to giving me one of these

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,680
huh all right keep your devil says

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,680
symbols to yourself

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:47,870
these may not come with the fancy system

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:50,029
administration tools but then again and

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,339
they require you to be a little more

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,139
hands-on get into editing configuration

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,029
files but one thing they all have in

00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:58,610
common is they have a fantastic package

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:01,730
manager okay and I'll get to this in a

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,649
few minutes but great package manners I

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,990
love these distributions you know people

00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,040
would say you always hear people talk

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,740
about Gen 2 which is a great

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,180
distribution I really do like Gen 2 I

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,639
say it's one that you compile from

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,189
source it is source based yes but you

00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,860
don't actually compile the the software

00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,209
yourself you are running a package

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,459
management system I think it was a

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:24,589
Kapoor tidge is that in Gentoo and you

00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:25,999
emerge it and you might not get some

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,809
hands-on but it's not the same as

00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:33,170
unarchive in a tarball and doing the

00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:35,120
three steps the configure make and sudo

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,850
make install or however you want to do

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,199
your install so is it a great stuff and

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,629
you're gonna learn a heck of a lot too

00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:43,910
documentation for these three product

00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:48,410
projects alone his is stellar

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:50,389
but it's good but I still these great

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,329
stuff a little more difficult little

00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:56,930
more hands-on but still I wanted more I

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,790
want more I had the third tier Slackware

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,319
two great vanilla this is and I think

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,029
even Patrick had said when we talked

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:07,250
about talked with him about slack where

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:09,800
it's a very vanilla distribution is it

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,600
the next slide what I always heard

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,250
starting out Red Hat teaches you Red Hat

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,870
Linux Ubuntu teaches ubuntu linux

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,329
slackware teaches you links if you want

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,829
to run linux run slack where that's what

00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,839
I always heard when I first started out

00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,829
way back in the day I went from Red Hat

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,439
to

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,540
Susa and then people said if you want to

00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:29,029
learn Linux learn slack where and so I

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,610
picked up slack where and started to go

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:34,929
with this and with the focus of trying

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,699
to do as much for myself as possible and

00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:40,069
the tools that come with slack where do

00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,899
not get in your way and obscure a lot of

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:43,850
those configuration files that you would

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,730
add it by hand which was very beneficial

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,100
to me starting out so if I wanted to add

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,480
users I mean there was a

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,130
couple different ways to add users you

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,259
could run the eighth iPad user or two

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,910
user ad tool or you can actually go in

00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,850
and add users manually by editing the

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,100
files it was a great distribution for

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,009
learning that the vanilla philosophy

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,490
there's no overall unifying management

00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:09,279
tools like a Linux comp or a yes in

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,930
Slackware standard tools that are custom

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,329
all flavors of Linux you could do a lot

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,339
of hand editing of the config files and

00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,660
when you edit them they don't get

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:22,810
overwritten by some other tool that

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:26,589
might be running which is great sir yes

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,750
no don't worry about gen - that's the

00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:31,750
second tier it's ok it's good

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,509
it forces someone to be a little more

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,550
intimate with their system I think now

00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:38,079
gen - of course you do need to be very

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,339
intimate with your system you can get

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,500
into it it's like the rice or

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:44,829
distribution so you can really tweak the

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,250
heck out of it slack where I found was I

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,240
mean you get a standard set of

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:53,139
applications and then when you want to

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,029
build upon them it forces you to to be

00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,459
aware of what's on your system and what

00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:00,670
you may need as opposed to that a second

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,529
software is the developers delivered it

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,509
and it has it does have a package

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,250
manager a lot of people say here saved

00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,380
socrata than a package manager but it's

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,600
cycler does have a package manager and

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,250
sock where had a great package manager

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,290
and then chefs Griffin came along and

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,560
ruined it all with SBO package it made

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,870
it all easy and everything but it's

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,009
great SPO package is a great great

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,630
utility but when I was doing working

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,759
with slack where originally and reason

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,240
why I started with it and loved it was

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,620
it gave me the opportunity problem it

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,079
gave me the opportunity to do a lot of

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,329
compiling and I came as slack where and

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,120
I was like well I did red hat with rpm

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:42,790
and I don't want packages I said I'm too

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,380
good for packages these aren't for me I

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,569
want to learn how to do it so you know I

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,000
get the base system I started learning

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:51,550
start compiling my own kernel I decided

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,399
to compile my own X free I did the

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,470
genome the KDE that was fun stuff I did

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,420
Mozilla and then after I did Mozilla

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,010
never had anybody ever compile Mo's of

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,620
course you guys back there

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,730
and after that I got the same you know

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,590
this is fun

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,510
and I learned a heck of a lot because

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,490
you get to get in there read the

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,230
software sources' and with the greatest

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,800
thing is when something breaks it

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,620
doesn't work to actually dig in there

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,570
and fix it is such a rush the first time

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,650
you do it you know just figure it out

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,480
yourself or if you need to tweak

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,310
something in a source code it is it is a

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,250
rush and you do learn a heck of a lot

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,110
you learn how to use a bunch of the

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,630
debugging tools you learn where stuff

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,180
you know the file system structure where

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,360
stuff goes you get into other things

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,460
where you might have to learn about

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,950
making actual devices where making sure

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,350
devices are present on a system so I

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,670
learned a heck of a lot but then I also

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,710
learned that there's a reason why

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,810
package managers with large repositories

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:54,370
are awesome because it does make things

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:58,680
a lot easier in some respects alright

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,450
now before I get into Linux from scratch

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,120
we give you some some a viable quotes

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,550
from that I think along the way that

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,950
will help you with your Linux from

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,780
scratch experience there's the old adage

00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,360
that practice makes perfect

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,540
now that has been updated to say

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,840
practice makes habit okay be aware of

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,150
that if you always approach the same

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,290
thing over and over again if you always

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,450
do what you will be done you're always

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,270
gonna get what you always got alright so

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,340
if you're running into problems or how

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,110
you approach a problem particularly when

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,020
you're doing something brand new if you

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,790
keep coming at it the same way don't be

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,740
surprised when you keep getting the same

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,170
response you know if something is

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,350
failing and you keep doing the same

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,880
thing over and over again don't be

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,920
surprised if it keeps feeling I have

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:52,320
sometimes I find myself doing that I

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,560
will compile some software is broken yes

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,260
well yeah I will compile something and

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,150
it doesn't work and then I'll be like

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,540
let's just run make again still not

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,390
working

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,420
let's reconfigure run make again still

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,800
not working you know you could step

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,410
backwards and do different things but

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,240
don't be surprised be try and come at it

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,010
from a different perspective

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,620
you know and

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,320
take some some practice of trying to

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,920
think out of the box and being aware of

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,740
what you are doing and what's going on

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,630
in the software and as you you fail more

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,730
and more you're going to find different

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,830
ways to get around that and that takes

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,230
me to the next slide don't be afraid of

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,710
failure its failure is your friends a

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,710
lot of people say to me is Linux from

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,440
scratch hard no it's not hard as a

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,660
challenge

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,390
you ask me if something is hard that's

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,240
that's a subjective question do I think

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,370
it was hard when I did it not really I

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,140
thought it was a challenge but then

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,020
that's not a fair question I mean I've

00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,120
had a couple years of doing this stuff

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,650
so I might not approach it from somebody

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,060
who's only had one or two years of

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,010
experience and some people I've talked

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,560
to said it was really it was really a

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,050
big challenge to get into and try out

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,360
Linux from scratch but I'm here to tell

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,860
you I followed the steps I went through

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,240
it and I have a successfully booting

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,040
Linux from scratch system and I know

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,860
other people have and they have a whole

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,110
project on it so you can do it okay you

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,390
can do it but don't be afraid to fail I

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,640
failed the first time going through and

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,590
I discovered where my problem was you

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,120
know and I learned from that and I'll

00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,220
pass some of that wisdom on to you

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,290
because back ticks aren't quotes and

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,190
you'll learn that too in just a few

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,790
minutes but expect to fail on this if

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:49,860
you've never ever done anything similar

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:52,770
to this okay Linux from scratch this is

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,120
the exciting part it's a project that

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,160
provides you with the step by step

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,890
instructions for building your own

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,950
custom Linux system entirely from source

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:04,860
code and that's exactly what you're

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,010
going to do if you've never

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,959
if you've compiled your own software and

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,850
installed it on a system you have

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,839
probably one step above the person who's

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,690
never done this before

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,760
well my approach to Linux from scratch

00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,740
and I got into it I was really surprised

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,470
and you will come away with this

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,910
experience for a great appreciation of

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,300
what the developers of these dishes

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,410
Lucian's do just again a base system

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,050
installed there's an incredible amount

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:36,460
of work and knowledge that goes into

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:38,260
this and you as trying to learn Linux

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,930
from Linux on from scratch or anything

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,590
there's an incredible amount of

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,350
responsibility that is going to be

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:47,260
placed upon you to get as much out of

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,570
this as possible okay and I'll explain

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,040
some of that as they go along this is

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,350
what the linux from scratch website

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,800
looks like very you know very basic

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,420
Spartan but very informative I just put

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,540
a screen capture in here because I

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,730
wasn't sure whether I'd have access to

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,770
the outside world from here but there

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,960
are different flavors of Linux from

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,300
scratch and I'll cover those right now

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,490
this is the one I'm focusing on it's

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,250
standard Linux from scratch called LFS

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:18,070
then there's beyond Linux from scratch

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,410
which extends from Linux from scratch

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,650
you are going to get a basic bootable

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,300
Linux distribution or Linux operated a

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,700
star rating system with some basic tools

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,150
that you can then take to the next level

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,400
beyond Linux from scratch so you get

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:36,100
stuff like a usable applications like

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,320
links or links for and you can go with X

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,360
or gone there and get your desktop

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,550
environments and do all sorts of stuff

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,620
with it but Linux from scratch focuses

00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,230
on getting the base system up beyond

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,180
Linux from scratch is getting some other

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,460
functional software on there and taking

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,400
it to the next level there is automated

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,690
Linux from scratch so if you want to you

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,220
know you build a couple of links from

00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,810
scratch systems and you start doing this

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,360
on a regular basis there's a way to

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,620
automate the build process so that's

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,750
automated Linux from scratch then

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,030
there's Kross Linux from scratch which

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,680
is a building Linux from scratch for

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:13,390
across compilers and different systems

00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,160
different architectures teaches you how

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,560
to do that then there's hardened Linux

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,390
from scratch which is basically the

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,830
first two Linux from scratch and Beyond

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,440
Linux from scratch with the focus on

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,300
security but again what I'm focusing on

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,890
today for learning it is just purpose as

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,630
a Linux from scratch and we're also

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,520
gonna be using the live CD which I'll

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,760
cover in a minute links from scratch has

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,480
a very basic live CD which I found was

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,620
very useful was the beginning process

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,750
now my project steps and

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,610
goals that I had and I'm going to say

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,180
for you if you want to follow my steps I

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:48,160
used a virtual machine for doing this

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,020
again my goal was learning not so much

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,380
as building a functional system that I'm

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,030
going to use in any other way but

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,130
learning using a functional environment

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,710
for like a server or a desktop or

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,559
anything so that's why I chose to do it

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,809
in a virtual environment so once you get

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,720
set up with a virtual environment I use

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:11,010
VirtualBox you get the resources that

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,940
you need and I spelled resources wrong

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,170
then you're going to spend a lot of time

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,790
reading and reading and reading and

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,170
reading some more there's a lot of

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,480
reading involved in this there's a lot

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,940
of fun reading I think you're gonna

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,050
build your Linux from scratch system and

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,270
then you can earn your bragging rights

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:28,630
trophy so you can tell all your friends

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,610
I did compile my kernel along with the

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,770
rest of my operating system has anybody

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,290
compile the kernel here before they used

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:40,420
to be a big thing back in the day but

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:42,400
not a lot of people do that any sad ok

00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,730
setting up your virtual environment now

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,040
I use VirtualBox some people don't want

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,920
to use VirtualBox because it's not

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,450
oracle associated with it but it is open

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,620
source and I it is very very very simple

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,920
virtual machine to get up and running I

00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,650
run it on Arch Linux I've run it on who

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,559
bunts you on all sorts of stuff is it so

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:09,700
easy to get up and running and to get

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:11,050
going now one of the caveats that I have

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,130
run into and this is important when

00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:16,470
you're setting up the VirtualBox

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,470
environment I was sir

00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:34,580
yeah I could I could use chroot um I

00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:36,980
just wanted this in a separate

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,559
environment that I could turn on and off

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,470
very easily I can pause it if I wanted

00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,179
to I wasn't really thinking about using

00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,309
chroot I could have used a whole other

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,380
system to build it on but I was like

00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:49,820
what's the easiest and fastest way I'm

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,029
gonna get up and running on this thing

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,370
I'm like virtualbox why not I'm just and

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,110
I did it initially just on a lark just

00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,299
to see what it would be like but it just

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,860
was as I continued doing it it sounded

00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,779
like a wonderful thing now there's a

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,549
whole bunch of different ways that you

00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,740
can do this this was just the way I

00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:10,130
started and I was recommending if you

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,570
really want to learn Linux using links

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,870
from scratch testing it out this is a

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,480
great way to try it and and for those of

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:23,990
you on VirtualBox is a cross-platform

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:27,350
thing so if if you're you're stupid and

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,649
you want to use Windows or I couldn't

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,480
think of anything else to say there but

00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:34,600
what I would also say is as you're

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,690
setting up in your environment

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,970
choose scuzzy I was opposed to ID now I

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,549
went and I used ID I don't know why I

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,899
just chose IDE and I built the whole

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:47,840
thing and of course it wouldn't boot

00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:50,210
because some of the modern kernels but

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,210
depending on which one you have treat ie

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,919
device is now a discussing device and it

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,419
kept on coming back and you might not be

00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,529
aware of that if you've never run into

00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:02,450
that or encounter that in your system

00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:03,770
because you set up the ID device and

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,200
even in the documentation

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:09,020
I believe they talked about pointing

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,409
into the IDE device what it would be

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,880
instead of a scuzzy device and it might

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,470
not do properly for you didn't for me

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,830
but I knew how to fix it because I just

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:24,260
went in and switched it from using the

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:26,510
dev HDA to dev SDA in my fstab but

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,170
that's one caveat or a little piece of

00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,520
advice I'd recommend to you

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:34,470
if you've never done something like this

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,429
or experiences stay with scuzzy yeah I'm

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,200
gonna show you that in just a minute

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:39,660
I'll show you I walk into the VirtualBox

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,690
just giving you a quick overview make

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,240
sure you have networking now I advise it

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,890
to have networking it makes it a whole

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,840
lot easier to get all the sources that

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,250
you need or you can do a shared

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,350
directory if you don't want to set up

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,420
networking in VirtualBox but it's very

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,770
simple to do I mean you could also do a

00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,070
shared where you pull down all the

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,570
sources put them on that shared

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,790
directory if that is accessible both

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,520
outside and inside of VirtualBox base

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:07,679
memory I do recommend at least 256

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,309
megabytes maybe more that's what I did

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,720
on here

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:16,860
this machine is system 76 is about about

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,620
5 years old now and I just used 256

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:26,790
megabytes and I do believe it's a dual

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:29,040
core with C I don't know I keep looking

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:31,160
at this and I never remember I think

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,419
it's only like 1.2 gigahertz processor

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,990
so it's not the beefiest system in a

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:39,950
world but anyway and high-speed Internet

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,200
access is pretty beneficial if you

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,330
forgetting the sources and everything

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,100
high storage considerations well before

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,940
I go all through that let's pop over

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,950
there to the let's pop over to the

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,059
VirtualBox and take a look at that a

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,190
second and I'll show you

00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:00,480
VirtualBox has anybody here not has this

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,630
or anybody who's not familiar with

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,309
VirtualBox there's only you've never

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,260
used it ok

00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,880
I don't want to get too involved in and

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:15,330
how to actually set it up it's very

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:17,190
simple you create a machine up here you

00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,750
just add a new machine and it'll walk

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,850
you through what you want to call it and

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:25,110
I'll walk you through the basic steps of

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:27,000
of creating all these settings in here

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,220
for the virtual machine of course just

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
like the name the operating system type

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,710
the version of Linux it is that there's

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,240
some tweaks in there that they might

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,620
throw if you choose specific things like

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,100
there's like Red Hat I think an Arch

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,660
Linux

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,240
having different things but I just chose

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,030
Linux to six and then you can get down

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,429
into configuring the system base memory

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,679
now if you decide upfront that you

00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:55,020
wanted to vote one gig of memory to it

00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,270
and then as you're working with it and

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,770
you say oh you know I don't really need

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,600
that much you can always come back in

00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:05,549
here and alter the base memory size and

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,929
it allows you to choose boot orders and

00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:10,950
stuff and I'll come back to that in a

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:12,630
minute the type of display you can how

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,190
much video memory you want to want to

00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:19,039
add in different things and then of

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:23,640
course your storage with the storage I

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:26,850
went with this structure approximately

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,220
13 gigabytes should be fine now in

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:34,409
VirtualBox and in most virtual machines

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:36,570
you define a storage device yes you

00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,159
notice I chose an IDE controller here

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,530
that's why I say don't do that make it

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,900
scuzzy it'll save you some headaches

00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,360
possible headaches in the long run but

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,140
if I want to add or when I go through

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,600
the process of creating I can go down

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,260
and add a new cd/dvd of controls no I

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,750
don't want to do that a new disc an IDE

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,820
controller create new disk and if I walk

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,409
through the process there's a fixed

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,570
storage size and there's a dynamically

00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:04,980
expanding storage size the big

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,710
difference between those as it says

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,110
right there is with fixed I can tell it

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,419
13 gigabytes that's the size of it and

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,929
no bigger all right with dynamically

00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:20,640
expanding storage it takes up you define

00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:24,030
a size that you want to allow it to grow

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,669
to but the initial size is significantly

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,799
smaller like if I did the 13 gigabytes

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:31,500
in Alec you know it has the ability to

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,710
allocate 13 gigabytes but it may only

00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,380
initially create two or three gigabytes

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,730
in the partition size so it will grow as

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,100
you need it

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:46,530
so just be aware that if you're if

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:48,270
you're limited on space just be aware of

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,340
what you're setting your hard disk

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,340
storage type to sir

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:02,450
you mean the dynamic expanding I haven't

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,910
experienced any I never experienced any

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,360
but then again I usually choose a fixed

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:12,020
storage size now when you're building

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,190
these packages compiling they will tell

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,410
you upfront with each package

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:19,100
approximately how much space is going to

00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:22,880
take up so just be aware of that you're

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,880
going to in some cases expand that

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,980
storage pretty fast you know expand into

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,420
it and it's going to be a rather fluid

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,240
because you're going to compile those

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,830
sources and it might be about a gig of

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,150
space that it takes up with the compiled

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,130
source but then when you're finished

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,990
you're gonna you can easily get rid of

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,450
all that but just be aware of your size

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:44,210
and your space limitations that you have

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,770
on your system I have never had a

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,450
problem or heard of a problem with

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:51,520
dynamically expanding storage has

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,520
anybody here had issues with it sir

00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:55,909
uh-huh

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,630
okay if you have any concerns I

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,490
recommend staying with a fixed Thor

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,440
sighs it's just my bees are over all

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,940
what again what that's initially going

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,149
to do is when it creates that that

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,090
virtual image it's going to be 13 gigs

00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:29,399
as opposed to it being maybe 2 or 3 gigs

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:35,340
to expand the 13 gigs or whatever on it

00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:44,010
so just be aware aware of that does

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:46,230
somebody else want to say something yeah

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,450
that and that's that could be a

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,669
possibility as I didn't try and the

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,100
dynamically expanding but again like I

00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:55,620
said you could rapidly fill up that

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,899
space and it required to expand itself

00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,880
so as it's compiling and trying to

00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,620
expand the amount of disk that you can

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,179
use to space that you can use it in

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:10,200
virtually it might slow things down and

00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:13,250
make it a little a little less fun I

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,210
didn't mess around with audio whoops

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:18,029
wrong thing I didn't mess around with

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,580
audio at this point networking I

00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:24,149
attached Network one adapter used NAT so

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:28,169
that it would pool and give itself a

00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:29,130
DHCP address let me think here a second

00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:35,309
I'll probably have to show you when I

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:38,070
boot be aware that I do believe it's the

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:40,760
signs a 10 dot number in here when I

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:45,350
actually boot the system if I forget

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,350
remind me huh yes

00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:53,210
yeah and I think the first one is the

00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:56,510
gateway or 10.1 or 10.2 is the gateway

00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:58,670
be aware cuz you can't you have to

00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,410
assign I would recommend when you get in

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,870
there I'll show you but sticking with

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:06,110
above is ten dot something that's

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,720
something ten and above because one and

00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,910
two are used for specific purposes one

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,620
of them is the gateway and if you assign

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,360
it to one of those addresses you're not

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,610
gonna get the results that you want but

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,530
I just remembered about that I forgot to

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,940
put it in here but I'll explain that

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,710
when we actually boot the virtual

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:26,360
machine so there is some stuff read some

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,030
of the documentation if you're not as

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,340
familiar with virtual machine VirtualBox

00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,710
or whatever virtual solution that you're

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:37,160
going to use get a little familiar with

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:42,590
it but that's basically what my setup

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:46,010
was dish drives setting up the disk

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,720
storage the video I only left like basic

00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,950
thing was four megabytes is I'm not

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,990
doing anything graphic it's all

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,730
text-based at this point and then of

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:57,679
course memory the more memory you

00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:59,390
allocate to it the faster your your your

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,620
compiles are going to be but there's

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,700
going to be a limit because it is a

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:08,840
virtual system and I think that's

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:10,610
processor if you have the cassette

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,799
processors how many you want to assign

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,890
based upon you have its virtual

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,710
processors if your if your system

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,120
supports it and a bunch of different

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,240
things I left most of this at the

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,860
defaults I'm not overly concerned about

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,700
performance because this was a leisure

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,190
activity now granted I built this over

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,260
about two months and my free time and

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,380
having a fun time so just be aware of

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,470
that now oh let's go back again then to

00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,270
storage considerations 13 gigabytes

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,220
should be fine but as you read the

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,870
documentation be aware that they're

00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,320
gonna start talking about a hundred

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:51,169
gigabytes 250 gigabytes in some places

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,320
really large stuff looking towards the

00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:56,900
future if you build Linux from scratch

00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,370
13 gigabytes to do is this probably more

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:03,730
than you need but 13 gigabytes

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:05,530
with a minimum of 1.3 gigabytes to be

00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:08,679
able to compile and install all the

00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:10,600
software when I set it to 13 to get the

00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,210
sources and put it all in there for

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,919
compiling and with the thought of maybe

00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,790
doing beyond Linux from scratch after

00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:20,770
this point so I set my root partition to

00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,059
a living gigabytes as they say a minimum

00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,910
of 1.3 gigabytes

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:28,510
I said a home partition of one gigabyte

00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:31,570
I said a 150 megabyte partition and then

00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,580
850 megabyte swap partition

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,350
you don't have to go into all that sub

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,419
partitioning at all you could just make

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,669
it all under root of course they do

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:41,760
recommend a separate boot partition and

00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:46,240
in some cases that might make it easier

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:49,419
but that was my partitioning scheme and

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,200
I did not come close to using that much

00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:56,620
space on there so it's just it's in the

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,690
documentation so you can follow that now

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,179
the Linux from scratch build process

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:05,770
that I follow was get the documentation

00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:07,600
get the live CD okay and grab the source

00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,270
files Stage one is where you're gonna

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,409
build the tool chain stage two is when

00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,810
you're actually going to build your

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,159
Linux from scratch system then you're

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,419
going to configure it and then you can

00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,530
enjoy it now I'm gonna walk through

00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:22,899
these stages a little more detail now

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,790
documentation when I built my Linux from

00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:28,030
scratch system I I said in a

00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:30,639
recommendation it's helpful to have a

00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:32,919
dual monitor based system or a

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,590
widescreen monitor because I had the

00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,929
documentation open right here and a

00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,090
virtual machine open right here reading

00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,679
work in reading working it made it a

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,690
whole lot easier you can flip back and

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,730
forth and have separate machines I don't

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,520
care but that was what worked for me it

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:51,399
was very convenient

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,200
now the documentation is really it's

00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:57,040
really good and it's pretty detailed and

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,290
you can get it online right here Linux

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,900
from scratch this is what it looks like

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:05,380
if you want to read it in HTML pay table

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,240
of contents pull it down it's very laid

00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,760
out in great sections it tells you how

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,410
to go through each step and we'll come

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,560
back to this documentation in a minute

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:16,770
you can do it like this like I did

00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,600
online or you can pull it down in PDF

00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,660
there's a PDF file or you can pull all

00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,250
the HTML files offline there's not a lot

00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,810
of pretty pictures in it in fact I don't

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,360
think there are any pretty pictures in

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:30,210
it it's just mostly text this is kind of

00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,790
what it looks like the PDF file is

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,060
pretty much the exact same as the online

00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:37,410
HTML what it goes through so either way

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,610
that you want to do it even if you want

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,050
to take a word and print it out because

00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,680
you don't want to waste your printer ink

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,070
on this you could do that too but what I

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,890
like I said what I had going on was

00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:51,330
documentation on one screen virtual

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,920
machine on the other and that was one of

00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:56,760
the benefits of a virtual machine now

00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,430
the Linux from scratch live CD you need

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,480
to build Linux from scratch from an

00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,790
existing Linux system ok now before you

00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,610
go from your existing Linux system or

00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:11,370
environment to having a customized Linux

00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:13,980
distribution you need to have the tool

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:17,490
chain in between in that process so what

00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,020
you're trying to get to from an existing

00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,580
system that may be configured in

00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,190
specific ways is trying to get to a

00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,590
generic tool chain then in some ways

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,200
might be more customized to your

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,850
hardware but get get away from any you

00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
want to get a vanilla tool chain is kind

00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,450
of what you want to do and then from

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,960
that tool chain build your Linux from

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:40,550
scratch system ok and that's where the

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,750
Linux from scratch live CD comes in I

00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,970
thought it provided some of the best

00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,650
environment you can go you'll read

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,480
through the documentation if you don't

00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,250
want to do the Linux from scratch live

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,260
CD you could build it from an existing

00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,070
Linux system you can build it from

00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,520
another live CD you can even install a

00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,960
version of Linux inside of a virtual

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,820
machine and build it from there now I

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,740
chose the Linux from scratch live CD

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,180
because I'm a little lazy sometimes and

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,150
it was right there the documentation

00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:12,180
said go ahead and go for it so you pull

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:16,110
that down as a fairly small CD and in

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,860
here under virtual machine you can come

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:23,100
up under the settings and where you have

00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,560
your storage devices go ahead and right

00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,540
here is add a cd/dvd device

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:34,090
and you can choose a disk image as

00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:36,760
opposed to as opposed to actually a CD

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:40,210
drive device so I just grabbed the out

00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,690
linux from live live CD from their site

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:46,630
pulled it down add the ISO and now I set

00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:50,410
it up as the device to be mounted at

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:52,420
boot and actually at cd-rom DVD ROM is

00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,460
where boot order right there I set it

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,320
for and that boost straight into Linux

00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,630
from scratch CD so you're really good to

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,730
go now you've read the documentation and

00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,380
Linux from scratch CDs as well the Linux

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,380
from scratch documentation will say you

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,880
know this CD is a little out of date

00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,870
okay you might have a hard time booting

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,180
it on sated

00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,620
systems with SATA devices and everything

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,720
but the beauty of using a virtual

00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,390
machine is you don't have to worry about

00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,310
that because you're not worrying about

00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:21,400
the latest and greatest Hardware you can

00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:23,170
set it to be IDE or scuzzy devices cozy

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,540
is what I recommend so you don't have to

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,740
worry about it being too out of date for

00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,200
your current system because you're using

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,510
a virtual machine so that's that's a

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,830
bonus right there so I recommend for the

00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,630
learning experience get the links from

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,610
scratch live CD then you're gonna need

00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:41,020
to get the source files but that's after

00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:42,370
we we boot into our environment okay

00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,750
tool chain like I said is a clean

00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:46,210
environment to build Linux from scratch

00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,670
is built from your existing Linux from

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,560
scratch or Linux system and what I used

00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,450
as the quote existing Linux system is

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,330
Linux from scratch now if you choose not

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,130
to use their live CD they do provide

00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,870
some information and documentation of

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,090
what you need to look out for what may

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,190
be some of the caveats you may have on

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,960
building a system from the different

00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,260
tools and how they're configured with

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,460
different distributions now I said where

00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,000
I talked about it might be a bit

00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:15,730
outdated you could use an existing live

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,770
CD or whatever and then boot the ISO in

00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,820
the VirtualBox and that was configured

00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,820
under storage devices

00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:34,980
I think the links from scratch live CD

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,890
is a few years old it hasn't been

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,120
updated and they say in the

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:42,900
documentation it may not support some

00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:45,150
SATA controllers so if you have a newer

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,790
system that has SATA drives in it with

00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:52,230
the SATA controllers it might not be

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:55,770
properly and recognize those devices but

00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,820
that that's why I say if you yeah that's

00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,260
what you're doing if you're in the

00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,260
virtual environment

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,820
that limitation is kind of you know you

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,020
really don't have that limitation of

00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,940
worrying about it being on newer

00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,830
hardware um because the virtual

00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:13,760
environment generally is configured for

00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:17,300
a generic well supported Hardware system

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,890
okay I already went through here read

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,750
documentation you're gonna have to do a

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,070
lot of reading virtual machine you know

00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,680
you have your virtual machine ready with

00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,930
networking you have your Linux live c LS

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,720
F live CD ready to boo read the

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:34,080
documentation there's a it's not very

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,660
long okay so go ahead and begin reading

00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,910
it reading it a couple times really give

00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,770
it a thorough read all right because

00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,260
this is important this is I think the

00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,850
the the important part of this you can

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,830
sit down set this environment up and

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,080
follow everything right along step by

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:51,090
step but i really suggest that there's

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,950
no surprises to you read the

00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,660
documentation beforehand and that's the

00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,210
way I did it I've read you know I've

00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,060
read through it first and then I came

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,160
back follow the steps step by step read

00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,260
the documentation and as I got to each

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,980
step I read the documentation went back

00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,260
did everything got the results that I

00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,630
wanted expected read the documentation

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,270
went on to the next step so you're gonna

00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,620
have to do a lot of reading so what

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,790
happens then is you're ready to go

00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,400
you're going to boot into the build

00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,560
environment and I will set that going

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,510
right now because that takes a couple of

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,580
seconds let me fire this off and start

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,420
it up this is what it looks like when

00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:32,760
you boot from the links from scratch CD

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,980
kill it off not very amazing it looks

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,860
just like almost any other distribution

00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,140
that doesn't hide the boot process

00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,420
behind the fancy graphical display

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,430
screen anyway you're gonna boot into the

00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,609
build environment you're going to run

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,260
through a standard of fdisk to set your

00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:52,599
partitions you're going to create your

00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,819
file systems and there you're going to

00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,020
mount your partitions and inside those

00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:57,730
mounted partitions you're going to

00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,530
create the source directory which you're

00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:03,220
going to work from and then you're going

00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:05,799
to download your sources you can

00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,940
download any source that you want you

00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,740
know following through that if there's a

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,349
newer version of tar or there's a newer

00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,849
version of gzip or B's if you can go

00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:15,339
with that they recommend in the

00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:17,079
documentation for this project follow

00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:21,520
the steps use their sources you'll have

00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:24,369
the best results W get is your friends

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,220
if you go in the documentation so as you

00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:29,170
the W get the source list right there

00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,569
then you can use that source list to

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,130
pull down all the sources it'll take you

00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:35,170
or depending on your high-speed internet

00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,630
connection a few minutes it only took me

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,750
a few minutes to pull it down and it's

00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:43,480
so easy all right you can spend a day

00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,400
pulling them down individually but if

00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,740
you just use double you get with this in

00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,750
that list it'll pull it down

00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,799
automatically in just a few minutes and

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:55,569
you'll be happy you did that oh I just

00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:57,819
decided to point out to you that dollar

00:42:55,569 --> 00:43:00,460
sign LFS is the environmental variable

00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:03,130
to your LFS mount point which is covered

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:06,339
in excruciating detail over and over

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,410
again in the documentation okay back to

00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:11,650
my tips again suggestions read each page

00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,450
entirely type all commands type it all

00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,690
in don't copy and paste it in get

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,190
familiar with the system alright there's

00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,859
some really cool stuff in there you're

00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:23,559
gonna be using awk you're gonna be using

00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:27,910
said you're going to you're going to be

00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,740
using echo in text redirection in some

00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,480
pretty cool ways that you might not be

00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,829
used to and you'll learn some stuff

00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,980
you're like well I don't need to use VI

00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:39,540
anymore I could just use cat and that's

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:43,380
all I need you know it's really cool

00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:46,089
it's fun you're gonna learn that um

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,299
double check everything I can't stress

00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,950
this enough double check everything

00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:53,319
triple check it and then check it again

00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,089
because a lot of times there's some

00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:57,219
pretty complicated commands

00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:59,140
things in there that you need to type in

00:43:57,219 --> 00:44:00,549
and if you get it wrong you got to start

00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,200
all with back beginning if you get it

00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:05,499
wrong and don't realize you got it wrong

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,579
you're not gonna find out and so you

00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:10,809
know five or six weeks or days later

00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,099
that you screw something up and then

00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:13,509
you're like why isn't this working

00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,239
because I went through that built the

00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:19,869
whole pool chain and I got through about

00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,969
a third of the actual build process and

00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,759
I'm and I do a test and this like fails

00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:26,710
I'm a recompile I do the test fails

00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,210
again still doing the same thing over

00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,599
and over again over and over build it

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,089
failed

00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,979
like what the hell all right so I had

00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:33,579
the guy step back I went back a couple

00:44:32,979 --> 00:44:35,469
of steps

00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:41,319
everything fine up they'll fail it's

00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:43,599
because it's because of this a single

00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,249
quote is not a back tic all right be

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,069
aware of that in some of these cases

00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:49,509
these little things like that because

00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:55,059
when you're looking at the documentation

00:44:49,509 --> 00:44:57,190
let me let me pull it up let me pull

00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:59,529
something up here where it's a good

00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:07,630
interesting one where's my mouse oh

00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:09,309
they're all they cuddling when you when

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,739
you have to type all this stuff in by

00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:13,329
hand sometimes I can't remember which

00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:15,700
though what the one is there's one that

00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:17,499
is like this long but it's like a bunch

00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,920
of different said commands with back

00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:23,799
ticks and single quotes and it's and

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,430
it's complicated just that's what it

00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:28,289
looks like

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:31,289
be aware of that double check everything

00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:31,289
okay

00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:55,130
oh I finished everything dude hold on

00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:59,420
I'm sorry about that one second

00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,420
how can you repeat what you were saying

00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:29,240
and that's where experience comes in the

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:39,680
flavor right there that's some good

00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:42,770
advice where was I anyway let's get back

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,930
to where I was okay let's look at it

00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:47,660
quick I'm getting close to the end of

00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,040
the time foot pack page layout kind of

00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,380
when you're looking at the page now

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,320
what's really cool about this is so you

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,390
can judge how long certain things are

00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,800
gonna take you each page is laid out

00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,110
with a package name and then what is

00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,930
called the standard build unit and the

00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:06,170
first package that you compile they've

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:10,250
been utils they call one standard build

00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:11,900
unit okay so if you time that based upon

00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,240
how long it took you to compile Ben

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,370
utils they give you a standard build

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:20,480
unit for all the other packages so

00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:22,490
something like GCC might be fine I'll

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,390
show you that in a minute actually I'll

00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,150
show it to you right now

00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,850
Lib see it says approximate build time

00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,100
6.9 standard build units is going to

00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:33,740
take you approximately seven times as

00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,560
long to build glib C as it did for Ben

00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,540
utils so if you time the first one or a

00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,030
run time on that it'll kick back how

00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,830
long it took to compile and then you can

00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,900
base upon how long it's going to take so

00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:46,490
you can start the build process and of

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,040
course once you start the but after you

00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,840
finish reading it and reading it again

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,780
and then following the directions to

00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,630
build it and you start to build process

00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:00,080
all that fun extra time gives you the

00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:03,620
opportunity to continue reading through

00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:05,690
the pages on here and this is actual

00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,380
part of the build process constructing

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:12,260
Linux from scratch

00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:14,390
they go into more detail on how to what

00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,740
the they go in this detail into what the

00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:18,320
other meaning of the configuration

00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:22,570
options are and when you get into the

00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:26,590
bottom of this on the actual build part

00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:30,020
if I go down to like said they will

00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:32,180
cover the actual commands of brief

00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,310
synopsis of the commands and libraries

00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,740
and stuff that are included so like

00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:42,109
package config where's a good one

00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:44,670
like GCC they will come down here and

00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:46,049
you get a really good idea with short

00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,839
descriptions of what gets installed

00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:50,250
programs libraries and stuff so you get

00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:52,650
a better feel for what's on your system

00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,559
where things do particularly when you

00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:57,720
get involved with the text processing

00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:01,230
packages you'll see some commands that

00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:03,029
are in there cut and other commands that

00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,260
you might not be familiar with but it'll

00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:06,270
tell you well this is what it's going to

00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,510
do and then you can look it up further

00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:12,930
in main pages or in info pages or online

00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:14,609
or actually read the sources okay so you

00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,529
read and documentation so the

00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:18,900
documentation here is really good lays

00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:20,220
it out will give you a short description

00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,799
of what's in there and then that's where

00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:25,589
I say the onus is upon you to then

00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:27,630
explore further read the documentation

00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:30,210
included with the sources go to the

00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:33,210
webpages and stuff where you get the the

00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:36,029
documentation from and the sources from

00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:38,309
and really take the time to get involved

00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:43,890
in this and the more you put into it the

00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:46,020
more you are going to get out of it okay

00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,579
short description so read the source

00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,920
code files like I said the readme

00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:52,079
install fact other documentation code

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,339
files when I was you know those are

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,220
always helpful to read even though you

00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:58,289
might have some of it outlined for you

00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,880
in Linux from scratch and they're gonna

00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:03,089
walk you through you get yourself

00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,289
familiar with these files and tells you

00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:06,119
how to install on some of the different

00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:07,470
configuration options now of course

00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,869
Linux from scratch is geared for

00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:12,089
building a Linux from scratch system but

00:50:09,869 --> 00:50:14,250
if you start reading the source code

00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,990
files and documentation as you go

00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,720
further on down the line you want to

00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:20,010
build your own packages in the

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,230
distribution doesn't come with a piece

00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,849
of software you want to install it this

00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,010
is a good place to get used to reading

00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:27,930
this stuff so you can see what different

00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:30,720
switches you can configure how to get

00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,789
that information actually how to install

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,779
it and then some caveats and the factor

00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:38,880
where to get help after you're done

00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:42,119
building the tool chain process like I

00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,740
said first stage is is setting up

00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,630
everything second stage just building

00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,910
the tool chain process you actually do

00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,049
it almost links from scratch twice it's

00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:49,349
what you do you build the tool chain

00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,729
which

00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:52,769
almost the full lengths from scratch

00:50:50,729 --> 00:50:54,479
system we built the tool chain then you

00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:56,549
use that tool chain to compile Linux

00:50:54,479 --> 00:50:58,499
from scratch once you get to the point

00:50:56,549 --> 00:51:01,200
of building links from scratch tool

00:50:58,499 --> 00:51:03,720
chain they recommend it and i also

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,700
recommend it back it up make a copy zip

00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:09,180
it ARC's zip it up

00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,849
gzip it up or these zip it up save it

00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,609
you can use that later on to do the

00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:17,160
whole process again but just just keep

00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:19,079
it so you don't taint it or anything and

00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:24,630
have a backup copy because backups are

00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:28,249
very smart sir you could do that but it

00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:33,479
might be you'd save just a lot of space

00:51:28,249 --> 00:51:35,160
just it's not very large and you could

00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:37,319
save that's gonna save the whole thing

00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,960
in this case I'm just talking about

00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:41,849
saving the compiled for a tool chain so

00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,309
you could actually then if you wanted to

00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,499
repeat this again somewhere else you

00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,519
could take that tool chain out and you

00:51:46,499 --> 00:51:48,749
could either reuse it in a virtual

00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,710
machine where you'd use it somewhere

00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:54,569
else on same architecture of course that

00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:58,950
answer your question but you could do a

00:51:54,569 --> 00:52:00,269
snapshot okay then after after you have

00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,599
the tool chain built this is where

00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:05,969
you're going to use she route to get to

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,819
build your new system he was gonna set

00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:10,229
additional mount points proc dev

00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:13,019
different things like that and it's all

00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:15,210
covered in the book you're going to to

00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:16,799
route into your new route you're going

00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,170
to then walk through creating your new

00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:20,849
directory structure you're going to set

00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:25,200
your paths the interesting thing of this

00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:27,660
is how the tool chain works you want you

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,279
want a vanilla system you want a system

00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,349
that's geared you know just plain

00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:33,989
vanilla the users of toolchain but as

00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:35,549
you build the software instead of using

00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:36,869
the tool chain software you want to

00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:38,640
start using the software that you've

00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:40,979
compiled for the system so that's why

00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,930
you set the path like this and it goes

00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:45,599
through there it looks in the standard

00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:49,140
system path your your root path right

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,609
now for the possible binaries and

00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,890
applications that it needs it wants to

00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:54,329
use and if it doesn't find it the last

00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:57,150
place it looks is the Linux from scratch

00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:58,859
tool chain and it starts using those so

00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,809
as you start building the software and

00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:02,430
compiling it it's going to put it into

00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:05,279
your root directory and use

00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:07,170
before use that in preference of the

00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:11,279
tool change so you then get a truly

00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:14,700
customized system compile and test

00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:17,069
everything tool chain you don't have to

00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,170
but I recommend you know if it says to

00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:21,180
do a test go ahead and do the test of

00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,650
the software so what it does it will can

00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,270
you you're gonna configure it you're

00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,789
gonna compile it and then you're going

00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:28,980
to make the software and make the test

00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:31,020
and it'll do the process of the tests

00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,000
and the tests are successful you know

00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,920
with pretty good confidence that it

00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,839
should be it should be good if the tests

00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,490
fail that's a really good indication

00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:41,210
that you missed something along the way

00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:44,549
it might have to go back a step or two

00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,380
so that's why I say do run all tests and

00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:49,170
then while the stuff is compiling read

00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:51,859
the project files after everything's

00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:53,789
done you get to go on the grub

00:53:51,859 --> 00:53:55,020
configuring grub to be the booting

00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:56,819
because you're gonna have all the

00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,380
software and that's where you can go

00:53:56,819 --> 00:54:00,690
listen to my other presentation from

00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,000
last year of the Linux boot process

00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:05,279
focusing on grub which then leads to my

00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,170
other presentation the previous year

00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:09,180
which is the entire Linux foods process

00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:12,329
but that's not anyway that's nothing but

00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:13,920
um you're going to have yourself after

00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:20,250
you configure grub a system that you can

00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:23,670
actually boot into and this is the Linux

00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:26,130
from scratch live CD which gives you a

00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,020
generic is there anybody who's never run

00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,299
a live CD or a Linux setup in here

00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,730
obviously not that's what you get it's

00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:34,619
just it's just a generic I don't even

00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:38,670
know why I booted into it at wasted time

00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:41,490
so I'm going to that that absolutely

00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:43,619
shows you nothing but I'm going to reset

00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,380
this because I want to select my boot

00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:48,750
device and instead of I'm going to boot

00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,579
off my IDE controller and here we go

00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:55,680
this is Linux from scratch once you get

00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:58,970
it done and it's just Linux a generic

00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,569
Linux system decompresses just looks and

00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,910
it boots

00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:05,069
there's no thrills here I mean there is

00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,410
thrills this is exciting actually

00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:08,970
this is this is great when when you get

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,220
to this point you're gonna be very happy

00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,589
and you're gonna have learned a lot and

00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,300
this is what it's going to look like but

00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:18,210
you're not going to get KD

00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,640
eeehm so don't expect the log right into

00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,830
acts and you can see where things might

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,450
fail things might succeed and you'll

00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:34,370
know what all this stuff usually means

00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:36,900
one one other caveat I will say this is

00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:41,550
this is where I said okay adding IP

00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:43,890
address 10.2 dot that's what I was

00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:47,430
talking about ten dot zero dot two dot

00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:48,990
one is the gateway 15 is what I added to

00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,360
this just to be on the safe side but be

00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:54,450
aware one and two are used specifically

00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:57,120
don't use them on on your four-year

00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:58,740
machine inside what was what was I just

00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,540
thinking of what was the other caveat I

00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:08,390
was gonna say what was I talking about

00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:11,880
before I got sidetracked by this yes

00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:13,110
throw a minute throw a minute there was

00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,430
something else I wanted maybe it'll come

00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,430
back to me Oh

00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,080
gather cavea to be aware of just keeping

00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,300
your mind and they do talk about this

00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,150
doing this inside a virtual machine is

00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,860
easy because you can attempt to pause it

00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,270
and save it and shut down your machine

00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,280
and bring it back up now I never

00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:34,890
actually did that because I've had

00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,440
experience in the past where I paused it

00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:39,360
now this was pausing a virtual machine

00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,180
running for my father

00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,430
Windows 2000 inside of a Bluetooth

00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,380
system and when I restarted it didn't

00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,450
really work too well but I never pucks I

00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,790
never shut down my machines but

00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:53,280
occasionally I just shut it down if if

00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:55,140
wherever you are in the process okay

00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,620
make sure that you're aware if you're in

00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:01,710
a tool chain you're going to need to

00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:06,330
reset those environmental variables okay

00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:08,580
if you are in the root environment and

00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:10,860
you shut down and come back to continue

00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,600
to process you're going to need to reset

00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,700
that whole environment back up again

00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,170
it's very easy but you're just going to

00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,990
need to be aware of it having to set

00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:20,400
that up now

00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:21,930
last couple of things were to get help

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,910
Linux from scratch website is very

00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:25,970
informative they have an IRC server

00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:27,840
their mailing list

00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,300
not as

00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:32,250
as as informative I thought it was gonna

00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,470
be with the mailing list you guess so

00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,690
see got IRC channels on freenode I'm

00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:38,940
always an odd cast planet I'll give you

00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:40,890
help any way I can there's always sorts

00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,790
of great great people that you can go to

00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:46,410
most importantly have fun this is fun

00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,750
okay don't get over if you're getting

00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,310
frustrated stop take a break go onto

00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:53,430
something else for a little bit

00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,840
my informational sources my link

00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,730
information this will be a made

00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,100
available I don't know from where but

00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:01,410
it'll be available from my website I'll

00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,840
talk about on tilts about where it's

00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:05,520
available to I have recorded it myself

00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,010
so it'll be available soon probably end

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,630
up on hacker public radio sometime and

00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:12,330
let the magic begin I'd love to finish

00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:19,800
with my favorite monkey video and any

00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:27,780
questions that you may have sir build

00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:34,800
your own when a computer you mean like

00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:36,630
building from oh just there are a lot of

00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,000
I'll tell you what there are a lot of

00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:42,320
resources out there is Tom's Hardware a

00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,320
good place to go for that anymore

00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,610
stop by my to the table and we'll have

00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,780
more discussion about that because I

00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:46,890
give you some more about anybody else

00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:50,550
with the question any sir no oh hell no

00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:53,070
no no no well three days if that's all

00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:55,590
you're doing for three days no this it

00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:57,270
takes it takes a lot of time okay and

00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,100
most of that time is compiling the

00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,260
software I mean you could read the

00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:05,730
documentation and all that but like I

01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,780
said I did this on my spare time at

01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:09,060
night

01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:11,400
approximately devoting an hour to maybe

01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:13,110
per night or just compiling one or two

01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,330
programs tonight and it took me about

01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:17,100
two months now that wasn't every single

01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,930
night but there were some days where I

01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,970
just compiled one program there some

01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:22,650
days I compiled spent a couple hours on

01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:24,630
it it's gonna take a significant amount

01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,430
of time that you can do it in a weekend

01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,869
I've heard people doing it on a weekend

01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:29,820
depends on the speed of your system

01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:31,560
depends on how much you're gonna sit

01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,450
there and watch everything and continue

01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,650
the process so it's going to take a

01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,359
significant amount of time if you ever

01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:38,070
did it Jim have you ever done Gentoo

01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:40,950
it'll take you a little bit longer than

01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:43,560
Gentoo to get a base system up anybody

01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:45,980
else question I thought I saw a hand up

01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,980
over there

01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:58,070
that was not me yes I know what time it

01:00:55,340 --> 01:01:01,910
is but this is important stuff people

01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:04,270
want to know thank you thank you for

01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,270
your time

01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,900
what about this I can help you like it

01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:23,900
we have the same problem

01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,230
let's get the word out

01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:47,160
as a service leader in cloud computing

01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,780
all we do is hosted computing to us the

01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,760
cloud is just the next generation of

01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,620
hosting and if someone who's been in the

01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,690
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,770
we're in a unique position to really

01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,900
help bring these two worlds together

01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:00,240
these different sets of technologies and

01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,550
to help companies embrace this new world

01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,620
and this great new tool that allows

01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:07,170
faster innovation not only is it about

01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:12,540
us being responsive and accountable but

01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:15,380
it's about us doing more for you webos

01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:18,990
an OS that works the way that you do

01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:23,090
across all your devices HP Slate and
