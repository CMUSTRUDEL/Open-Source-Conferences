00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,400
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,579
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:37,290
she is going to tell us about community

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:40,680
organizing for free softer activists she

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,059
has been around free software for how

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,800
many years tip like 45 years and she has

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,980
seen many user groups and different

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,520
software projects try to put together

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,570
community events and she's run several

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,410
community events are you still involved

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,920
with seagull uh yeah that's um it's a

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:09,960
very back burner project it may be next

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:13,170
decade there will be a seagull well if

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,270
you are out in Seattle and you were

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,909
looking for a good new linux fest that's

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,960
what seagull is about I'm going to turn

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,960
it over to Deb know Deb Nicholson

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:31,250
community organizing for C software

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,630
activist Deb Nicholson a sec all right

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,210
uh can y'all hear me all right without

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:45,210
me like kind of talking and too ok

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:47,610
fantastic so um oh wait oh alright says

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,140
what I'm going to talk about probably

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,729
most of you know a little bit about the

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,240
first piece I'm going to talk about why

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,409
it is critical to me in particular and a

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,219
little bit about the state of the

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,780
movement now some it's about the overall

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,490
strategy and perception of the free

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,829
software movement both from the inside

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,820
and the outside and then then we're

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,119
going to drill down into specific

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,569
tactics for growth so so if you have

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,469
questions now you know kind of what the

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:18,109
outline is so in the 60s people really

00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:20,030
thought that computers are going to be

00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:22,069
used primarily to augment the power of

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,719
the human mind they also thought that we

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,489
were maybe only using ten percent of our

00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,700
minds and that we might unlock the rest

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,409
of it with LSD and then we're shortly

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,349
after that we would discover how to

00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:35,659
become immortal and live forever um and

00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,939
maybe computers would would help us out

00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:40,930
with that right which is great that I

00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:44,540
mean for social goal that's pretty lofty

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,489
that's not really what happened so as

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,340
community-minded is the 60s were they

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:52,430
don't really see the the true thing

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,769
which is the gift of the personal

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,209
computer which is that it allows us

00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,909
freedom of speech and freedom of

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,219
assembly regardless of our location so

00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,189
we can talk about any topic we can talk

00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:05,599
to anyone about it but that those two

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,459
freedoms to become meaningless if we

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,609
don't actually control the means of

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,230
exercising them so freedom of speech if

00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:17,109
you're a mutant someone ties your hand

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:22,430
behind your back is not so helpful so um

00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:24,769
so power a little bit about power power

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,900
isn't evil I mean it can be used for

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,739
evil of course but it's how things get

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,620
done it's also it allows you to make

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,900
choices for yourself and power to make

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,349
choices included it includes making

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,409
choices about what's on the selection so

00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:44,299
a menu with like one page offering

00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:47,569
celery sticks and another page offering

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:49,099
carrot sticks is a pretty boring menu

00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,419
and doesn't really give you very much

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,669
choice I'm going to show you how many

00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:55,099
pages give gnu/linux offers to the menu

00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,979
might be like many many many pages or

00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,719
what the food analog is there but the

00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,549
point is is that if you're not if you're

00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,129
not deciding what's on the menu then

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:09,079
your choices between a and B you're not

00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:12,079
so great and power does not just get

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,870
handed out it's not like a oh well I

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,620
would like some power today I've decided

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,940
I did yoga or super awesome session I'm

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,360
just gonna go out and seize it

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,950
um it does have to be seized and it

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,140
often has to be seized from somewhere or

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,750
from and that doesn't mean like you know

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,760
beating somebody else up for the toy but

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,730
it does mean that there will be some

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,140
resistance and and that's okay and we

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,910
should plan for that it's it's not going

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,130
to be a field of dreams scenario where

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,620
you just build it and they will come as

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,860
you know we've already built it and and

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,710
some people came but you know Kevin

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,320
Costner has not shown up and we still

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,240
have some work to do is what I'm saying

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,160
even when things do go viral it's not

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,050
magic that's actually like individual

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,550
people passing something along to their

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,910
family and friends and their family and

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,710
friends saying yes I do think dryer lint

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,130
is dangerous I'm going to pass this on

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:16,570
or you know whatever else they decide to

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,380
pass on I don't know if you get that one

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:24,410
but yeah anyway so free software in my

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,919
mind is distributed power so for a lot

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,990
of you know if you take a monarchy you

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,330
have like mono you have one person at

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,730
the top who holds the bulk of the power

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:38,150
everyone descending down from that holds

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:41,320
power at that person's of the hest or

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,790
desire and it can be revoked at any time

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,620
when you have a monopoly in a specific

00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,680
space then you have something more

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,980
analogous to monarchy so free software

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:59,500
in my mind is like a democracy everybody

00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:02,840
has a little piece of the power um so

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,730
today free software users are the

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,990
minority I hate to be a downer but I

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,320
think you guys probably already knew

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,300
that so as an organizer Saul Alinsky is

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,210
considered to be the father of community

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,250
organizing he is a great book called

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,870
rules for radicals if you want to delve

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,290
into this little deeper I'm giving you

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,419
guys a little bit of a taste but this

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,530
quote from him is about being a realist

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:30,260
so you start from where the world is and

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,540
you have to accept that that's where it

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,460
is so if

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,930
coming and preaching to the choir isn't

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:44,460
growing the movement then we have to

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:48,030
look at other ways to do that so kind of

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,810
building on that the low-hanging fruit

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,250
and what I mean by that is that the free

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,280
software movement does a really good job

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,350
of recruiting white middle-class guys

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,180
that have kind of grown up knowing that

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,210
they were good at math and being told

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,890
they were good at math and um you know

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,510
we invite them to flash meetings or

00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,340
groups and they show up and they feel

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,250
comfortable immediately they get the

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,100
jokes they get the t-shirt with the

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,680
weird pearl joke on it like everything

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,800
they're like oh awesome my people

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,390
fantastic so that's I mean that's the

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,980
plus the the minus is that not everyone

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,320
feels comfortable immediately when they

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:33,930
arrive at our events how many of you

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:36,570
already seen this statistic okay so just

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,510
a couple years ago a flash policy did an

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:42,090
international survey of the free

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,630
software communities and they found that

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:49,020
women worldwide you know so some places

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:52,710
may differ but worldwide women comprise

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,420
less than two percent so it's not just

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,610
just having a conversation with someone

00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,310
outside and it said well what if we

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,410
don't ever get to like a fifty fifty men

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,810
women and I was like we're at two

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,640
percent now and I think we have a long

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:10,410
way to go before we have the discussion

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,480
is 48 enough we're not there um we could

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:16,260
get there perhaps it's kind of take a

00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,890
little bit of work so what happens now

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,200
if it that's such a low number that it's

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:25,860
actually uncomfortable to come into the

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,010
room and be the only one of something

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,110
it's like if you imagine I don't know if

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,610
you vote I feel like there was like a

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,190
Brady Bunch episode about this or

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,010
something where somebody was invited to

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,380
a costume party but actually it wasn't a

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,910
costume party everyone else was just

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,450
wearing regular clothes and

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:47,640
one person was invited like haha we told

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,010
this one person it's a costume party so

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,750
it's kind of like that like oh I'm

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,460
wearing a chicken costume and you guys

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,940
are all just wearing jeans and t-shirts

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,980
what's up so that's weird so but there's

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,340
the good news is that there's specific

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,080
ways to fix that you know aside from not

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:10,140
telling people to wear a chicken costume

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,380
um so we have we have a movement that I

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:16,470
think for political determination and

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,060
you know small D democracy we need to

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,060
grow and then we have a huge population

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,560
that we have not yet reached so those

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,130
are those two things are a good match

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,140
right I'm not saying that you know

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,620
anyone here that your glove your project

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,840
is singly responsible for Petra waiting

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,730
for perpetuating sexism or racism or

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,800
anything else like that obviously if

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,020
that was the case then you wouldn't be

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,360
here to talk on growing your group and

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,050
getting advice on for free software

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,170
activists so we're going to talk a

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:54,720
little bit about how to do a better job

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:56,160
of that so lots of opportunity more

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,810
people spreading the word about free

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,790
software mean so we have more users more

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,130
designers more developers and so it's

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,260
kind of UCI it gets like recursive down

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,300
here at the like it goes back up to the

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,720
top and then it keeps going and it keeps

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,160
going so organizing is absolutely that

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,140
way so we're going to try and hold that

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:19,350
in our minds as we move on and so I give

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,890
you guys like the statistic about gender

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,810
there are definitely a lot of other

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,660
sites of opportunity right if we're

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,940
going to put the the happy spin on that

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,820
and you know I think the first two

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,100
people have mostly encountered that idea

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,640
that you know we're pretty white hair

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,640
and it's it's not always a comfortable

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,700
space for queer people people with

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,310
disabilities working-class people and

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,170
then non non computer people so there

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,940
are a lot of folks like I I often

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,190
encounter like somebody's friend or

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,020
their

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,490
soo or they're like well I'm not a

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,490
computer person mhm

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,870
mm-hmm and that's why that one's in

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,810
quotes because it's sort of like a it's

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,170
a it's a you know if that's a state of

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,209
mind for the person right like you if

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,570
you say like I'm not a computer person

00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:27,180
then guess what you're not and if you

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,920
say I'm a computer person who's learning

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,750
and just started programming yesterday

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,160
then okay you're a computer person it's

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,899
the same with dancing like you could say

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,519
like I don't dance but the only thing

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:47,399
that's stopping you from being a person

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:49,589
new dances is yourself so right so this

00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:54,690
is more like take this slide as like a

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:56,399
challenge maybe okay so um so we're

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,800
gonna I'm going to talk about tactics in

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,440
a little bit but they aren't just for

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,620
increasing diversity there for doing a

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,440
good job of recruiting and retaining new

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:12,449
people and creating a welcoming

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,240
environment for for everybody so those

00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:18,600
are all those are all good things

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,279
everybody everyone benefits from a

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,660
welcoming environment and a welcoming

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,600
environment is one that sort of

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,370
straddles professional and fun because

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,890
you're asking people to do work but

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,240
you're asking them to do it in the space

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,790
in their life that they would normally

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,279
like watch TV or hang out with friends

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,380
or a drink beer or you know some

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,399
something else that they consider fun

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:44,790
that they don't get paid for so in order

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,170
to do both of those things at once we

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,500
had to kind of hold that in our mind

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,420
it's um so you know we we treat people

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,569
respectfully but then we also have like

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,970
like pizza party thank you for you know

00:12:54,569 --> 00:13:01,399
version to release and stuff like that

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:05,399
so we kind of straddle those two ideas

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:08,850
um so this is a little bit more from

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,290
saul alinsky there aren't any shortcuts

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,660
so I'm going to share tactics but their

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,550
ashes are also their work it's I don't

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,889
have a silver bullet political

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,899
organizers

00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:22,089
have this you know Silver Bullet this

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,589
idea that they have named and they talk

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,259
about because they would really like for

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:29,470
it to exist a silver bullet is basically

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,509
like a very simple tactic that costs

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,350
almost no time or money but is like

00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,939
amazingly magically successful I think

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,759
it's like from the the werewolf thing

00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:41,559
like it kills a werewolf that doesn't

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,329
actually exist so all these things i'm

00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,970
going to i'm going to say like they're

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,999
they're not like oh okay so you know

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,129
just make sure you add the like a pink

00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:53,290
smiley face to your website and all of a

00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:55,839
sudden the ladies will show up these are

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,989
these are going to be some work fun work

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,089
i hope that you'll enjoy so i don't know

00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:03,160
what it was caring whether so Cesar

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,139
Chavez is another community organizer

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,730
game he organized migrant farm workers

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:11,199
and people didn't really think that

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,279
migrant farm workers could be organized

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:19,269
for whatever reason and so and he this

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,859
huge watershed movement and people were

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,559
just stunned they're like how did you do

00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:25,269
it like I just you know they were open

00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,489
then he was going to movie in part some

00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:29,199
kind of magic wisdom and he said they

00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:30,879
talked to one person and then he talked

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,169
to another person and then like he can

00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:36,879
stay in that until it was like okay I

00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:38,439
get it I get it I get it um so well he

00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,079
he did a lot of talking and he

00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:43,899
undoubtedly did in some really specific

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:48,040
ways at the heart of it most organizing

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:49,919
is still communication so that's so

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,269
that's we're going to talk about next so

00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,379
talking to people effectively this is

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,709
like an overview of the next couple

00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:58,089
slides these are some of the ways that

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,049
you can do it you definitely have to be

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:03,639
purposeful when you're filling up time

00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,259
like waiting for the bus you're just

00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,669
kind of like making conversation and you

00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,949
forgot to bring a book like that's a

00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:10,329
certain kind of conversation that's not

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,579
the kind of conversation that you have

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:15,459
with somebody that you want to have do

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,499
some work for you and you also like when

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:19,720
someone like hands you your change you

00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:21,399
say thanks like monosyllabic and maybe

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,619
like a little bit under your breath but

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,449
when someone's just given you like 200

00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:26,680
lines of code or just rewrote all your

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,990
documentation and

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,670
another language then you know the

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,190
situation does not you know demands a

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:40,000
little bit more than thanks you know so

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:41,830
um let's get more specific so right

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,770
right yeah and I have that later it's

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,839
like saying thanks is free that is

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,640
actually like the closest thing to a

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:54,700
silver bullet that you are going to find

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:56,740
is saying thanks okay so yeah um so if

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,630
you define your goal before you start

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,640
talking to people so maybe oh this idea

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,320
like i wanna i think i want to have a

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,750
user group and i like i do a PHP and

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,430
Python but i like the python more and so

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,020
like i'd like to do that so you might

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,760
not share like that whole thought

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,440
process with the person you're inviting

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,390
you might say we're going to talk on

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,800
thursday night about setting up a python

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,930
user group and then if that doesn't work

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,089
then you can maybe try the PHP group or

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,610
a more general like you know we're just

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,560
going to have computer club but when you

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,600
talk to someone who doesn't really know

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,240
you or like your whole thought process

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,709
about starting a user group to date just

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,150
be really succinct and say like we're

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:38,740
going to meet on thursday and talk about

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:41,200
setting up a python group um let's see

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,779
and so when you do that i stay on

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,029
message be upfront about your goal if

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,459
your goal is we're going to write a nap

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:49,810
and I'll get rich but other people think

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,250
we're just kind of hanging out then

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,480
you're not going to have the people that

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,800
you want showing up and they're not

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,040
going to behave in the ways that you

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,360
would hope they would behave so be

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,190
upfront about your goal and then you'll

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,810
get people that are jazzed about your

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,700
goal and not about some other weird

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,309
thing that you mentioned and also

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,199
keeping attention-getting measures

00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,179
thematically related so like you're like

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,370
this mythical Python group were setting

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,339
up and you're like mr. peanut it's going

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,929
to be there like why I don't understand

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,150
so then you're going to get people that

00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,459
like peanuts shown up or like people to

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,630
like top hats showing up you know so

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,750
unless you're writing like peanut butter

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,380
reading software as a Python mobile app

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,420
or something like mr. peanut out of it

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,840
and then a little bit more on staying on

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,220
message so one of the great things about

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,570
the free software community is that

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,220
people meet new people and they

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,690
become friends and then they become

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,809
really involved in each other's lives

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,220
and stuff like that which is fantastic

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,860
but when you have a new person showing

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,830
up and it's like hey I came for the

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,769
Pearl user group and near there like I

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,539
owe it should i ask cuz i'm really

00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:59,600
wondering what Joel's upcoming

00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:02,990
engagement has to do with PHP because

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,880
like yeah I don't know and so you so put

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,220
that those conversations somewhere else

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,840
to tell people like don't have opted a

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,490
bit off-topic conversations it's not

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,799
going to happen but if you give people a

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,080
place to do it then you have another

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,480
place for new people that don't have all

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,389
of the history and all the other inside

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,980
baseball that you've got to just come

00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:26,750
and learn about the project or the group

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:28,909
so pound off topic on IRC or hey we go

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,549
out for beer after the meeting that we

00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,590
have in person on campus and then we

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,149
find out like you know is he really

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,289
going to give her a ring or what you

00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:40,970
know so speaking of events or meetings

00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:44,779
they give you a specific time and a

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:47,720
place to focus on so it's you know not

00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:49,820
just a general conversation it's you

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:56,120
know you you can you can make an agenda

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:59,210
and you can get things done should also

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,100
consider a newcomers event because it

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,019
cuts out the weirdness of inviting one

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,399
new person at a time and it also makes

00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,840
it easier for you because you don't have

00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:11,029
to like constantly redo the hey so from

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,460
zero to nothing you know zero to 60 like

00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:15,379
this is what we're doing so those are

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,179
good and face-to-face helps people feel

00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:20,179
connected so even if you are distributed

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,950
over a large space maybe like piggyback

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,799
on an event like self and be like we're

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,809
gonna have dinner itself and you know so

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:33,500
those are all those are all good plans

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:37,250
um where am i oh so planning that event

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,799
a public place if people don't know you

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,600
showing up at a stranger's house after

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,519
dark especially like what if you happen

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,639
to live in the in the back of the house

00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,429
like or you know your front porch lights

00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:51,030
out and like or like the screen door

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:53,220
meets at creaky econo

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,700
his chainsaw massacre sound on the way

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,350
in don't do that also this means like

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,660
that people can have meetings when

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,340
you're not in town without breaking into

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,410
your house and you don't have to have

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,020
your personal address on your user group

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,470
site which is also good entice people

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,450
with snacks because snacks keep people

00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,330
from getting cranky and it also makes it

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,780
seem fun so um those are good no one

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,220
likes to be at a cranky meeting and then

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,230
make a plan and stick to it whether

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,630
you're having an IRL meeting or an IRC

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,850
meeting you should have an agenda you

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,760
should consider sending it out before

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:34,440
the meeting and um and then actually

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,940
stick to that agenda it's um it can be

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,500
difficult and so you might want to have

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:43,320
like a couple of phrases in mind to do

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,200
that like you know maybe you actually

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,270
put time limits on each topic so you can

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,070
say like well there's a lot of great

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,960
discussion but we just have four more

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,240
minutes on this topic so if we're not

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,040
really ready to make a decision maybe we

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,820
should table it for this week and do a

00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,460
little research and get back to it and

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,900
if you appoint a moderator then that is

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,990
someone's job to keep that meeting

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,550
moving you can also say things like oh

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,230
does anyone have a different viewpoint

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,270
to add because sometimes you get into

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,060
this like preaching to the choir fest no

00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:18,180
one's like yeah that sucks like you know

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,950
or we give the Emacs VI conversation

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,840
cropped up and you're meeting like you

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,920
got to be able to nix that stuff and

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,480
keep it moving or if there's like a lot

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,340
of stuff you don't have you can say like

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,020
hey there's a lot of information we

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,210
don't have would someone be willing to

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,410
research this and bring it back to the

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,510
next meeting so that way you hopefully

00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:43,290
as much as possible get your meeting

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:46,670
from like filler to content and you flip

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:49,860
it from content to you know filler so

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:54,630
and that's a that's a better meeting for

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:58,650
everyone trust me so stay on target when

00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:01,680
you're inviting people into your to your

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:05,690
event or your project or your user group

00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,760
think about who you're inviting so

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,230
if you're inviting students then maybe

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,679
you should be having your event on

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,940
campus if you're hacking on educational

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,740
software and then maybe should be

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,120
inviting teachers to your meetings and

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,360
if you're inviting teachers to your

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,220
meeting people who get up at 6am then a

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,880
nine o'clock at night meeting isn't

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:31,110
really going to happen so thinking about

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,240
it from that perspective um one of the

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,480
weird things about inviting people is

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,610
that if you invite one person ten times

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,140
they're more likely to come then you're

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,590
more likely to get one person to come

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,660
then if you invite ten people once each

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,429
it's a it's one of those things that we

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,410
all know but we don't necessarily like

00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,780
it's like a you know during the election

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,820
season you get like 50 pieces of mail

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,010
from each candidate it's because they

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,920
know that they've someone's paid and

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,530
done that research like even if you you

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,620
hate that there's like 19 messages from

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,900
the same candidate you noticed them

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,730
because there was 19 of them I'm not

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,590
saying go overboard like that but I'm

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,990
saying like it's worth inviting people a

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,050
second and a third time you know unless

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:20,550
they've told you like absolutely no way

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:21,929
um let's see what if you don't know what

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,730
the people you're inviting find

00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:25,320
motivating like say you did have this

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,920
idea where you want to invite teachers

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,600
to this group or this project and you've

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:35,100
invited teachers and none of them have

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:38,700
come so my advice there is to find one

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:41,429
teacher and then bring that like can I

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,220
pleat can I buy you coffee and talk to

00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:47,400
you about like why maybe teachers don't

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,040
want to come to this event and that

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,929
that's the best way to find out like

00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,000
really you just ask people it seems

00:23:51,929 --> 00:24:01,230
simple but it's not necessarily always

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,510
intuitive perception and recruitment so

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,980
the easiest person to recruit is

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,010
yourself and that sounds kind of funny

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,530
right like but what I mean is sort of

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:14,429
like a clone of yourself like so I I

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:17,070
worked at a place where we were doing

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,900
environmental stuff and and I worked

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,400
with this wonderful

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,830
woman named Melanie and she was like

00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,680
really perky in a chipper high voice and

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,630
blond hair and she went to like you know

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,760
an Ivy League school and you could tell

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,350
everyone on the project that had been

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,910
brought in by Melanie because they were

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,170
also like blond and went to an Ivy

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,240
League school and they were like really

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,830
tipper and excited and you know it was

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,020
like like they had coffee coursing

00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:42,200
through their veins naturally and so you

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,180
know that which is great but then you

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,520
could see like oh you know like the

00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,640
mostly the mopey gossip dude like

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,920
obviously Melanie didn't get him in

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,600
someone else brought him in so it's just

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,950
it's just one of those things people

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,430
feel comfortable with folks that are

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,070
like themselves and so in order to get

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:05,840
around that you have to actually make an

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:09,260
effort um one of the other things about

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,420
that is that so your your your group

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,820
might be the most open-minded awesome

00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,820
group of people ever but there is

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:20,540
already like a stereotype about geeks

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,540
and whether you like it or not that is

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,270
something that we have to overcome so um

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,830
if you talk about red dwarf when you're

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,030
inviting people to your user group

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,730
meeting then you're going to get like

00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:35,900
only people that are jazzed to sit

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:37,960
around and talk about red dwarf and so

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,950
you know keep your recruitment

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,020
conversations or your Invitational

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,600
conversations like really focused on

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:49,460
that and try not to like perpetuate the

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:55,130
stereotypes if you can help it um the

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:57,110
other thing as a so so just another

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,280
remember vs. unicorn like one of the

00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,630
things you do when you're inviting

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,270
people like you would never say to

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,860
someone like well right now we're all

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,060
white people we're really looking to

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,800
change that when you're talking to a

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,690
person of color because that's really

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,820
weird and really uncomfortable and

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,580
alienating you should just never do that

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,860
like or with women or would like

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,180
anything like you know like you wouldn't

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,640
you wouldn't say someone like Oh

00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,020
everyone in our group now is really poor

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,030
and we're looking for someone rich

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,370
because like no one ever buys pizza like

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,779
you really like never do that right so

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:30,330
just tell people like what you're doing

00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:31,919
and that you really wish they personally

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,169
would come people want to be invited

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,379
personally not as a member of a group or

00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:38,399
is like a tick box you can say like

00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:40,739
finally we're not all white dude it's

00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:42,179
like or whatever like no no wants to

00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:44,369
come and help you with that if they want

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,869
to come be part of your user group than

00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:51,929
that they'll do it because they want to

00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:54,119
do it um let's see oh and uh oh and

00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,519
another thing about the perception so if

00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,129
you have like a website for your group

00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,839
you might consider putting pictures up

00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:02,759
there so like there's this overwhelming

00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,409
stereotype like Linux users groups like

00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,820
I bet I know what that meeting looks

00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,529
like right like a bunch of dudes sitting

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,960
on black t-shirt if that's not your

00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:12,690
group then put up a picture right so

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,239
that people know like oh actually we're

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,700
we're branched out a little bit more or

00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:19,710
at the very least we're not mopey we're

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,719
having fun something to like give people

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,619
like an idea of what they're getting

00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:29,159
into when they show up so you know if at

00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:35,700
least like hey we're smiling and we're

00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:37,859

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,359
it personal when you do the inviting we

00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:41,429
did talk about this a little bit like

00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,559
asking if you don't know what the person

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:46,769
you're talking to is interested in then

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,289
ask them something that you might say is

00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:51,659

you know bring that stuff up send

00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,830
personalized emails like if you have

people you know you're not like spamming

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,539
a list you can be like hey remember when

00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,129
we talked like you wouldn't just go to

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,349
an event put everybody's card and you'll

00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:18,089

be great if you came to our thing and if

00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:34,769
you can invite people in person that's

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:36,929
even better um not always not always

00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:39,900
possible but and then repeat and repeat

00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:41,670
like sometimes when people say

00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,020
thursday nights aren't good for me they

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,630
really mean thursday nights aren't good

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:49,050
for me not oh that sounds boring and I

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:53,370
don't want to do it so repeat the

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:57,270
invitation um let's see so once you have

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,770
people what do you do with them uh run a

00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,400
good meeting we talked about that an

00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:05,040
agenda stay on time start on time for

00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,870
real it nothing lets people know faster

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,200
that you respect their time then

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:12,060
starting on time and finishing on time

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,580
and actually talking about what you said

00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,860
you were going to talk about a follow up

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,350
with people after the meeting if you

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,600
have a whole lot of new people come to

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,220
one meeting try saying like oh hey so

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,360
just five minutes at the end of the

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,860
meeting where to talk about like what

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,660
went well and what you think would be

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,740
better for next time and people will

00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,480
tell you they'll just give you

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,510
information for free about how to make

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,580
your next meeting better and it's and

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,280
it's it's it's definitely worth doing

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,110
and then improve it for next time so if

00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,910
people said like oh I really wish there

00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,860
had been water and then you don't have

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,930
water again and again and again then

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,310
people are just me like why does she do

00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,180
that at the end and asked us what we

00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:52,860
thought and then not implement any of it

00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,600
of course if people are like we'd like

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,070
caviar than you can say like we're on a

00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,120
budget for that and it's not going to

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,580
happen so that's fine a couple of things

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,680
to remember when you do meaning

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,590
introductions or an opportunity and I

00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,410
mean so you might say like oh it's my

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,960
friend Beth you could even go for this a

00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,340
this is my friend Beth she's awesome or

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,470
he'd say this is my friend Beth she's

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,630
awesome she organizes the Ohio linux

00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,280
fest so now people know all these things

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,710
and they're like oh I've always wanted

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,030
to exhibit at the Ohio has now I'm

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,890
really jazzed that you introduced me to

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,360
Beth and then Beth knows that I think

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,870
she's awesome and that I actually

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,150
remember what she does which you know

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:35,340
it's an opportunity um thank people

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,970
constantly seriously like I said it's

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,280
free to do it it's completely free and

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,570
use inclusive language um when your

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,980
especially when you have a lot of new

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,280
people so if you have like a lot of

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,260
acronyms and stuff try breaking those

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,480
down or at least asking like oh does

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,650
everyone know what i mean by tcp like

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,810
okay i'll say

00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,130
it or you guys came to a lug meeting you

00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,830
know it stands for like a linux user

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:02,850
group right and whatever it is but try

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:04,620
to D acronym eyes your your conversation

00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:08,610
until like you know everybody is up to

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:11,790
speed um the other piece of inclusive is

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:14,220
of course you know keeping all the

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,470
racist sexist weird this kind of

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:20,190
language out of your main meeting it

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:23,490
should go without saying and yet here I

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,140
am having to say it and then have next

00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,580
steps ready for people so like they come

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,870
to the meeting and then like you fill

00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,230
their brain up with all this excitement

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:33,240
and things that you're doing then then

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,440
they go away and what like what do you

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,020
want them to do next so if people have

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,760
said like oh I'll look into like seeing

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,760
if we get sponsorship for next time like

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,380
then you have you put that in as an

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,850
action step in the agenda and you said

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,530
like Sally said she's going to see if

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,910
she get someone to bias pizza awesome or

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:56,130
um you know everyone is going to try and

00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,890
see if they can check out the repository

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,470
without it fouling everything up because

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:05,730
we think we fixed that problem or

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:08,190
whatever um so think of your new

00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:13,640
participants as seedlings they need a

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:17,280
Karen feeding but not smothering so um

00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,410
check in with them you know make sure

00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,210
that everybody has done something like

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,560
if someone was quiet during the whole

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,950
meeting then you might want to say like

00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,770
oh you know hey Mary notice you weren't

00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,930
too talkative during the meeting um did

00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,610
we did we not get to like the stuff that

00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,580
you were hoping to or was it just like

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,880
really overwhelming or what um and and

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,100
then you know so check in with folks but

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,020
don't don't be able you know you know

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,520
what I mean by not smothering like you

00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,320
don't then show up at their house the

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,200
next day and be like we're best buds now

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,530
like I brought breakfast like no it's

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,300
too much um so ninety percent of

00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,340
organizing is actually follow through I

00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,070
know I says communication but it's it

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,980
out it's really actually follow through

00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:04,320
which is the kind of communication so

00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:07,149
you would not believe how many times

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,799
I've seen groups go and they have like a

00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:10,899
thing where they're collecting emails

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,339
and they get all these emails and I've

00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:15,129
given my email in two places and then

00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:16,659
like I never get an email back it was

00:33:15,129 --> 00:33:17,950
like what was that person doing like

00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,450
they were just wasting their time for a

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,519
whole bunch of hours and then also like

00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,849
a very tiny slice of my time which

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,649
whatever but like you know follow

00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:31,899
through so if you're gonna do stuff make

00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:33,099
sure you follow through um some of the

00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:34,839
tools to follow through we talked about

00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:38,079
taking notes for meetings creating

00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,429
action steps um keep institutional

00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,959
knowledge up to date and somewhere that

00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,759
everyone can access it so if you tell

00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:45,190
someone like oh hey go ahead like um

00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:46,599
check on how we did that last year but

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,700
you don't have anything on the wiki

00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:50,859
that's more than a week old then they're

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,070
not gonna really be able to do that um

00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:56,109
and and make sure as much stuff as

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,669
possible you know I may not put

00:33:56,109 --> 00:34:00,519
paychecks up there or whatever but like

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,959
stuff should be all accessible and then

00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,299
then you don't have to worry like

00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:07,179
nothing feels crumbier than like awesome

00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:09,520
you're you know I empower you with the

00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,990
ability to go and do this piece of work

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,799
for us just go check the wiki and then

00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:16,450
be like oh yeah so last year Bob set up

00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:18,339
the wiki for us and you have to like ask

00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,809
him really nicely to get a sign in

00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,609
otherwise you can't look at the part you

00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,980
need to look at and then like kind of

00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:25,750
slows down the whole momentum so like

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,299
unless there's a really good reason for

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,899
keeping it secret then just leave you

00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:34,779
know so let's leave it out there um set

00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:36,700
the deadlines and stick to them um and

00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:39,549
check in with folks like you especially

00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,720
like new people like okay so you say you

00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:44,109
would take on that like staggeringly

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,990
huge task how's that how's it going like

00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:50,950
you know every little bit more um what's

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,389
optimistically like I have figured

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:56,379
that's going you must be about halfway

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,490
done how has it been so um and then it's

00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:58,900
sometimes people need help sometimes

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,809
they did take on something a little

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,690
bigger than I know and then make sure

00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:10,029
again me thank people but even publicly

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:12,849
if possible um so share the work work is

00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:15,220
digital um you never run out of work

00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:17,560
there's always more work like you know

00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,920
that can be done like

00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,380
if you think about it there's always

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,750
more stuff no no one I know is really

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,070
like well go ahead if you you guys are

00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,160
in one of the software practice you're

00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:32,290
like we have zero bugs all the time and

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,750
like more contributors than we could use

00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:38,080
our documentation is awesome and super

00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:40,810
up-to-date ok yeah that's what I thought

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,960
ok so cheer the work there's always more

00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:46,360
and if you're sharing the work then you

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,920
you are able to avoid the bus factor

00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,410
that's kind of the grim thing we're like

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,940
one person is like mine mine mine and

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,980
knows everything and then something

00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,330
happens to them or they burn out and

00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,120
they're gone and then the whole project

00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,280
or the whole group is like proof you

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,010
don't want to have that situation and in

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,600
the burnout factor like not only that

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,670
not good for the thing it's not good for

00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,730
you like if you're like a project

00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:12,310
manager or like a team leader um share

00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,590
stuff really like don't get to the point

00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,660
where you're like oh my god like I

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,100
forget what my significant other looks

00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,410
like because I've been doing so much

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,650
hacking on this website for so long that

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,390
you know don't don't do that share it up

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:29,110
and documentation will help you be able

00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:31,570
to do the sharing even more important

00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:35,050
than the shared work almost is sharing

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:40,050
the the power so this is very much like

00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:42,820
a like an Alinsky kind of concept that

00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,250
especially for volunteers like signing

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,780
up for like George's secret project

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,600
where he's the boss and makes all the

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:52,660
real decisions not a real fun volunteer

00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:57,220
experience you would not so surprising

00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:58,690
um so don't don't be that person the

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,470
mission is way more important than the

00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,210
details and in a good mission statement

00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:08,290
is going to help you out like so if your

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,860
mission is let's have more introduction

00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,090
to python workshops in the boston area

00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,670
fantastic it's really clear that you're

00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,610
not going to be next week breaking into

00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:20,170
like an animal lab and rescuing rabbits

00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:25,390
like your mission statement has

00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:28,460
precluded that very firmly and then when

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,810
we talk about mission versus details so

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,359
the details if you've delegated

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,530
something then that person want to deal

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,230
with some of the details of

00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,480
accomplishing that task and you do not

00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,000
micromanage and if you find yourself

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,880
wine micromanage like to slap your hand

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,010
and stop doing it and if you like you

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,339
see them too and you're like oh they're

00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:52,920
doing it wrong wrong wrong wrong try and

00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:55,470
identify why it's wrong and then

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,960
articulate it and then put it in your

00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,210
you know internal documentation so that

00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,079
next time you don't have to you know

00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,640
have that conversation so maybe like oh

00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,260
we lost our old meeting place we need a

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,720
new meeting place and then someone's

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,300
like I found this meeting place and it's

00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,829
like oh um I didn't really give you

00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,300
enough information to find a new meeting

00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:16,859
place we really like the old one because

00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,140
it was handicapped accessible and it

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,670
wasn't very loud and I forgot to tell

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,680
you that we need a new meeting place

00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,960
that is also handicap accessible not

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,700
very loud and you have us at like some

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,810
kind of McDonald's like in a manhole

00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:33,300
like shoot so then next time you'll know

00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:36,150
to say that before you delegate like

00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,530
find a new meeting place for us and so

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,119
when you're sharing the power and you're

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,060
letting people like do it their own way

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,160
and come up with their own stuff then

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,510
they tend to stick around it's just one

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,800
of those things people like to be

00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:52,260
involved and invested um fostering

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,359
leadership talk about recognition free

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,130
and awesome reward people with more

00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,619
responsibility and then teach them to

00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,569
empower and recruit others so then

00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,880
you're like constantly sort of

00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:06,390
replicating yourself and one day you'll

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,690
be Legion it'll be fantastic um a little

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,460
bit more on the recognition like

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:14,970
consider giving people titles so if you

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,440
have like um like consider the

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,650
difference between like or vendor

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:24,089
captain and we have this guy Jeremy that

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:26,940
kind of does most of that like vendor

00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:29,099
captain titles totally free or you can

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,329
ask people and say like hey Kate like it

00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,849
looks like you're handling a lot of the

00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:34,920
press stuff like can we why don't we

00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:37,319
give you a title so that you know when

00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,810
you talk to media outlets like they know

00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:42,080
you're our press person what do you want

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,910
us to what should we have it be

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,340
why are ones this is a little bit like

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,930
you have conversations with people after

00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,190
they've started doing a little work you

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:55,170
can do it online you can do it in person

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,730
whatever depends on your project and

00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:03,330
what it is this is to help build

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:06,060
accountability one-on-ones are they're

00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:08,220
important it's kind of this conversation

00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,350
where you ask the person like so you

00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,940
know you've submitted a couple patches

00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,500
or you've been coming to meetings for

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,900
like a couple months or whatever how's

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,230
it going um hopefully you don't wait a

00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,780
couple months and see how these

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,060
check-ins it's it's absolutely not an

00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,160
opportunity for you to tell the like I'm

00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,770
sure touching and beautiful story of how

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,630
you first started using Linux you're

00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,340
listening you're asking the other person

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,870
like they're already here you want to

00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,850
find out from them like what's going on

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,470
with them like he's so like how does

00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,360
this fit into your overall planner I

00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,920
forgot to ask her you said you're in

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,180
school or you're doing computer science

00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,400
oh you're not you're doing marketing

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,960
that's interesting or like I know you've

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,420
been helping with the website like are

00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,070
you enjoying that like oh you just took

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,570
that on even though you hate it but you

00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,610
noticed it needed to be done maybe we

00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,230
should try and move there around so

00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,410
someone that doesn't hate it is doing it

00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:00,600
um so listen to how people are feeling

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,840
about it make it better this is going to

00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,250
help you you know not only in understand

00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,560
why people are here but it might give

00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,470
you an inkling about some of the people

00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,570
who left like why did they leave so um

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,420
and make sure you stay on topic like

00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:17,430
this is not like a weird um like an

00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,230
opportunity to be like oh you're

00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,210
Buddhist what's that like like no don't

00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,490
do any of that like to keep it on topic

00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:26,070
like or like I notice you're not married

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,010
no no none of that these are like these

00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:33,030
are like friendly but like keep that

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:37,550
line so the one-on-ones and um and let's

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:41,220
say so that's like that's the recap um

00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:43,590
you know you guys were just here this is

00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,570
what we did more people in different

00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:48,990
people larger and more successful free

00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:52,050
software movement right um invite people

00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,610
thoughtfully and repeatedly sure the

00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,119
work and the decision making and then

00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,609
people

00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,890
like your project is their project and

00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:00,990
they might even do more work on it than

00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,749
you do which is an exciting thing to

00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:06,720
have happen make sure people are getting

00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:08,609
something back like give them a title

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,009
that they can put like even unpaid

00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:13,349
whatever on the resume make sure that

00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:15,359
you know if they're like oh I I signed

00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:17,400
up to work on this because i thought i

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,140
was going to learn like PHP and then if

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,309
they're not learning PHP like figure out

00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,519
how to change it so they are learning

00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:25,499
PHP and then always be fostering

00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,240
leadership like you're always kind of

00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:28,799
like trying to organize yourself out of

00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,859
a job when you do these things so that

00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:33,960
you know if you you know maybe you have

00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:36,150
like a relative leaves you like a little

00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,289
island in the specific with no Wi-Fi and

00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,799
you're like I'm gonna go live on the

00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:41,970
island you know the the project goes on

00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:43,589
without you and maybe if you're like

00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,210
living on island was boring and come

00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,680
back two years later and the project is

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,170
going even stronger and better than

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,799
before so always be fostering leadership

00:42:49,170 --> 00:43:01,700
I am going to open it up for questions

00:42:52,799 --> 00:43:01,700
so people have questions yes

00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:33,800
right so um free oh yes thank you thank

00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,720
you um so the question is how do you

00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,880
reach into communities like for instance

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,050
the Hispanic community that you're not

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,000
the you are a have people from and I'm

00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:47,480
going to say so freaking Portland

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,310
started doing more outreach to the

00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,140
spanish-speaking population in Portland

00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:54,560
there and one things that they found was

00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:57,140
really successful one they went to where

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,240
folks were already gathering they didn't

00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,060
like just continue to invite them to

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,190
come here like where they are they went

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,690
to places where people were already

00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,390
gathering and we're like Hayley this

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,920
thing like at the end of it you get a

00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,960
free computer like what do you think

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,510
about that and they were like yeah and

00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,130
then what they did was they had they

00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:19,190
have like shift captains that are

00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:21,530
Spanish speakers and they do they've

00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,600
passed on most of the recruiting and

00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:27,890
organizing of those shifts to spanish

00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:30,080
speakers so to start find yourself a lie

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,640
in the community and that means not just

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,290
like going through the list of folks

00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,150
that we have but going to where people

00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:37,370

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,350

specifically for free software

00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,080
organizing and then that was the name of

00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,450

as a service leader in cloud computing

00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,930
