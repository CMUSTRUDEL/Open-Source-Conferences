00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:10,200
digital justice how technology and free

software and build communities thanks to

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,229
thanks everybody for coming out I

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,570
appreciate you being here so I am here

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,880
to discuss the concept of digital

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,070
justice what it is what it encompasses

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,960
and how I feel it'll be one of the most

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,920
important social justice issues we face

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,250
in the 21st century as with any subject

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,950
in order to fully understand this we

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,930
have to go to its foundational basis so

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,560
in order to talk about digital justice

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,890
we must talk about social justice what

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,079
is social justice how can it be defined

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,369
there are several definitions of social

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,770
justice that have been used throughout

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:54,720
history and social movements many will

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,649
define social justice differently due to

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,750
religious economic political or social

00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:03,210
world views however many of these

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,310
frameworks can be synthesized to the

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,869
view that everyone deserves access to

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,810
equal economic political and social

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,920
rights and opportunities I'm not going

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,030
to deny that I'm coming

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,650
this from a leftist perspective however

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,360
as mentioned there are different

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,489
perspectives from the left right and

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,530
religious spectrums that advocate for

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,370
social justice but through different

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,870
viewpoints and means of implementation

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,819
that being said this does not mean that

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,300
we cannot work together for the common

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,970
good of society many post modernists and

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,920
contemporary philosophers and thinkers

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,080
will criticize the theory of social

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,120
justice and that is a utopian ideal but

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,470
so too were the ideas of the advocates

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,930
for American Indians in the face of

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,549
genocide or the abolitionists lobbying

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,440
and organizing against the institution

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,450
of slavery or industrial workers

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,400
fighting for equal rights and working

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,330
ditions or women fighting for gender

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,739
equality and the right to vote and so on

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,690
ideas such as these can only seem

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,239
utopian to those that cannot see or

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,680
choose not to see what can truly be

00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,750
accomplished social justice finds its

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,700
roots in many ancient traditions but

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,200
most notably the ancient Abrahamic

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,359
religions such as Judaism and

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,209
Christianity with theologians such as

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,430
Saint Thomas Aquinas and bras Minister

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,880
bhatti codifying the social justice

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,120
framework into a gospel a gospel people

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,430
were expect expected to live by secular

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,320
social justice ideas are rooted in the

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,470
writings of the 20th century analytical

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,150
philosopher John Rawls who utilize a

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,209
thought experiment called the veil of

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,519
ignorance which was an idea rooted and

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,410
social contract Arianism which is the

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,530
belief that the idea the individuals

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:56,880
living within society have a social

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,380
obligation to contribute to it John

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,209
Rawls determine the morality of

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,069
something through the reversal of

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,859
societal roles and the viewing of them

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,930
through this veil of ignorance and his

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,569
greatest work justice as fairness for

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,819
all stated that every individual has an

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,630
equal right to basic liberties equality

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:18,019
and equality of opportunity brawls later

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,019
reiterated

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,380
you later reiated eight and renewed his

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,020
social justice framework and hopes that

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,170
he would scale back criticisms of his

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,490
radical socio political philosophy so

00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,830
later he came up with a work called

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,850
justices fairness every statement where

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,160
he declared that laissez-faire

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,040
capitalism welfare state capitalism

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,660
state socialism violate the principle

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,480
principles of social justice and that

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,530
more egalitarian democratic forms of

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,260
government and citizen participation

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,680
should take hold in order for social

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,420
justice to be achieved I'll repeat that

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,580
last force in the statement because it

00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,180
is important to the free framework of

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,040
free software and sharing at gala

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,810
Therrien democratic forms of government

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,060
and citizen participation should take

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:12,760
hold in order for social justice to be

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:15,210
achieved these are a necessity social

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,500
justice has always had advocates and

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,450
activists and social justice activism

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,950
has come in many different forms from

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,930
the charity of religious leaders to

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,030
secular radical activists advocating and

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,240
pressuring for social reform on behalf

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,920
of those who don't have a voice from the

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,930
slaveholder turn advocate of american

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,370
indians bartolomÃ© de las casas to the

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,200
pioneer settlement health social worker

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,970
Jane Addams to the radical African

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,300
American activist and outspoken critic

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,330

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,310

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,030
creator of the new project Richard

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,950
Stallman social justice activists and

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,460
activism have taken many different forms

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,410
and as with the lab regalan who once

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,930
said that helping other people is the

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,170
basis of society the case for digital

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,750
justice is here so what is digital

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,810
justice how can it be defined is this

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,360
really an issue what about issues of

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,640
hunger famine poverty disease early

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,120
child death and lack of education you

00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,710
might be thinking all these things all

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,720
of these things are and will become

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,320
intricately linked with technology as

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,310
the so-called global village spreads

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,070
technology is an extension of ourselves

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,780
our primate ancestors used it to make

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,990
their world better and we can do the

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,990
same

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,890
the globalization process would not have

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,830
happened without the advent of

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:42,020
technological booms of the 16th and 20th

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,820
centuries and what whether or not you

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,670
follow the ideology of Thomas Friedman

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,250
or Naomi Klein with respect to the

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:52,130
subject of globalization it cannot be

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,900
denied that it is not happening consider

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,210
those that have a car and those that did

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,720
not have a car look at how development

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,130
occurred when cars became commonplace an

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,890
elite class developed even with the

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,890
Affordable ford motor car in contrast to

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,480
another class of individuals this same

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,930
same thing happened with the railroad

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,280
and even the telephone development

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,780
occurred around the extension of the

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,270
railroad in the Eisenhower interstate

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,220
system as well major cities and economic

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,840
development boomed whereas smaller areas

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,550
that were underserved did not develop

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,780
and we're thus left out of cultural

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,490
technological and economic opportunity

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,080
the digital justice coalition of Detroit

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,290
has laid out a nice framework for a

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,700
definition of digital justice digital

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,590
justice is the belief that all members

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,180
in society have equal access to media

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,720
and technology as producers and

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,700
consumers digital justice is a belief

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,540
that values different languages dialects

00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,490
and forms of communication Digital

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,810
justice as a belief that prioritizes the

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,460
participation of people who have

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:59,210
traditionally been excluded from access

00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:01,490
to medium technology digital justice of

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,870
belief that prioritizes and

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,980
participation of people who have

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,990
traditionally been excluded and it also

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,710
emphasizes the demystification of

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:16,010
technology for regular people the last

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,480
point is key and has my emphasis Digital

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,910
justice emphasizes that media and

00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,500
members of society and technology should

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,880
be free from restriction it should be

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,860
affordable for all members of society

00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,710
and it should be shared and collectively

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,080
owned the concept of digital justice is

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,599
gaining traction in many places Finland

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,940
Estonia Spain and even the United

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,800
Nations realizing the importance of

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,560
access to technology have declared and

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,300
drafted into law the concepts of access

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,140
to technology and Internet as a basic

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,790
human right even with the network cables

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,780
laid

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,670
the satellite connections established

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,100
and the digital community is created

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,780
there are still individuals who do not

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,750
have access to technology and the

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,790
internet and what is even more of

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,860
importance here to note is that

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,920
resources are not the panacea to the

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,690
problem of digital justice it takes the

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,640
courage and dedication of individuals to

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:13,660
step forward and to advocate for those

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:16,180
cut off an analog silence speaking

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,970
globally between 2005 and 2010 the

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,440
number of Internet users doubled in the

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,870
past year the number of Internet users

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,400
worldwide surpassed two billion with

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,860
half of those users being in low-income

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,100
nations although these numbers seem

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,630
impressive and they are we still should

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,520
not detract from the fact that there are

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,200
still twenty-nine percent of the

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,520
population in high-income countries that

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
do not have internet access and

00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,210
seventy-nine percent of the population

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,960
in low income countries they do not have

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,880
inter access internet penetration is

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,910
another issue to consider especially in

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,580
the continent of Africa where Internet

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,710
penetration is at a pathetic nine point

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,540
six percent compared to the world

00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,300
average of thirty which is still low in

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,650
the developing country I was at when T

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,780
1% at the end of last year there was an

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,460
estimated twenty nine point five percent

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,250
of the world population connected to the

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,230
Internet think about that 29.5 of the

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:16,510
entire globe is connected to the web and

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:18,580
everybody else is not so we can see from

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,770
these numbers that there's already a

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:25,540
worrying class division of digital haves

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,700
and have-nots developing in high-income

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,380
nations individuals without a computer

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,400
account for twenty nine percent of the

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:38,020
population and 34.4 do not have access

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:40,690
to the Internet and low-income nation

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,430
77.5 percent don't have a computer and

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:47,050
eighty four point two percent don't have

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,930
internet these statistics obviously

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,250
correspond with one another if you have

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,520
a computer you're likely to have access

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,260
to the Internet right it's not always

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,700
the case though the trend of internet

00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,590
penetration and high inclinations is

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,210
growing but not having access

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,920
to the Internet does not only mean a

00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,740
lack of penetration it also means a lack

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,680
of affordability in the US the number of

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,290
one reason people do not have access to

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,480
the Internet is cost when we cease to

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,630
statistics thrown around even the ones I

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,070
just mentioned what you see up here

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,320
about penetration computer internet

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,520
adoption are not always considered in

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,170
these numbers the city that I live in

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,880
which is Athens Georgia is considered to

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,200
have a one hundred percent penetration

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,230
but adoption is not one hundred percent

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,370
and that's not ever accounted for in FCC

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,290
or any other types of research and the

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,150
US individuals do not have a computer

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,700
internet access or more likely to have

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,540
to not have completed high school and be

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,540
of a low income or socioeconomic

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
background

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,830
so I mentioned all these very

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,990
interesting statistics hopefully you're

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:03,220
still awake you're still here with me so

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:05,740
that's good how are people using free

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,480
standards and free software to promote

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,380
digital justice and to close this close

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,910
the so-called digital divide we can

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,960
first take a look within the free

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,950
software movement begun in the 1980s

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,450
none of us would be here in this room

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:24,700
today if it weren't for the efforts of

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,560
free software advocates we are greatly

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,350
indebted to all the hackers programmers

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,450
designers developers and organizers that

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,950
dedicate their free time to develop a

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,930
framework in which the freedom to share

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,780
software can be protected as well as

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,640
created through the billions of lines of

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,560
code written the graphics drawn and the

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,330
documentation composed millions of

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,210
people that cannot afford commercial

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,810
software or want the freedom to share

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:55,960
and use our software however they want

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:57,700
are allowed to do so although the free

00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,440
software desktop market is mostly

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,900
relegated to the technologically savvy

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,760
it is fast becoming an alternative for

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,800
people due to the great efforts made by

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,740
digital justice activists and creating

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,170
it easy to use desktop for the masses we

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,580
can see this with Ubuntu especially

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,260
that's becoming a very popular Linux

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:18,400
distribution and it's helping a lot of

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,140
people the free and open framework of

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,940
the software developed by free software

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,860
activists and advocates has helped

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,780
national governments and countries

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:29,890
across the globe especially in South

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,420
America Africa and Eastern Europe break

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:35,130
the chains of Microsoft and be able to

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,130
do what they want to with their software

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,490
another example of success in getting

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,870
computers to those that cannot afford

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,540
them can be found in the computer

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,040
recycling movement the computer

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,680
recycling movement in companies can

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,770
compasses many aspects of the Food Not

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,540
Bombs movement which emphasizes that the

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,720
actions of corporate and government

00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:00,130
entities allow hunger to persist in the

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,520
midst of abundance the Food Not Bombs

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,590
movement follows a freegan philosophy

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,800
that food that is bad

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:11,170
relative term Food Not Bombs aims to

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,210
reclaim discarded and surplus food and

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,340
distribute it to the poor hungry or

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,700
anyone else wanting a reclaimed meal and

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,350
conversation the computer recycling

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,740
movement and response to planned

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,360
obsolescence of technology and

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,910
Technology manufacturers and the veil

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,220
and culture of consumerism follows an

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,170
environmental social and economic

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,010
justice framework that emphasizes that

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,420
older computers are not necessarily junk

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,580
and can be brought back to life so to

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,000
speak with free software and a little

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,590
care and love the computer recycling

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,420
movement believes that the actions of

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,840
corporate and government entities allow

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,550
digital disconnectedness to exist in the

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,550
midst of technological abundance

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,200
the earliest report of recycling

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,170
computers actually dates back to for my

00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,910
research in 1993 but this operation was

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,360
not a reclamation efforts oh it was just

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,430
a way of getting rid of computers

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,550
responsibly you know not throwing it in

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,590
the trash like a lot of people do and I

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,940
think that the efforts of the portland

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,030
oregon-based free geek which i'm sure

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,590
many of you are familiar with is one of

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,560
the earliest examples of computer

00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,570
recycling and reclamation that aims to

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,700
seize older computer equipment load free

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,560
software onto it and distribute it to

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,430
low-income people or the technologically

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,050
disadvantaged free geeks model has

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,610
inspired hundreds of collected

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,470
organizations to develop around the

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,410
world all of them working in different

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:49,520
ways but with the ultimate end goals in

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,470
mind that is helping people these

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,240
organizations refurbish tens of

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,370
thousands of reclaim computers and

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,840
recycle hundreds of tons of e-waste in a

00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,390
responsible manner that doesn't use

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,320
prison child or dangerous labor and

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,910
recycling practices the computer

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,560
recycling movement allows individuals to

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,210
become empowered through technology and

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,800
for a computer to be saved from the junk

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:15,500
heap I volunteer in Athens where the

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,490
group called free IT Athens and this has

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,930
given me kind of a first-hand look at

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,680
what computer recycling can really do

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:27,380
for people athens has a thirty-nine

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,510
percent poverty rate that sits within

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,100
one of the most the poorest counties in

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,200
the nation and was recently honored by

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,010
Forbes magazine as one of the top

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,780
unequal cities in terms of income so

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:43,310
it's an understatement to say that poor

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:46,430
of Athens are in dire straits and since

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:49,520
2005 free IT has distributed thousands

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,890
of computers to people in Athens this is

00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:58,730
a small dent in numbers but a greater

00:16:51,890 --> 00:17:01,220
impact in people's lives another issue

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,200
that digital justice activists are

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,280
working towards is wireless networking

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,870
so that on a bullet point there and it's

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,680
a big problem we face in a sins I know

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,140
mentioned one hundred percent

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,270
penetration right another

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,390
it can afford forty fifty dollars a

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,980
month for a DSL connection which pales

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:26,490
in comparison to what they have in South

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:29,020
Korea the lowest price for broadband is

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,790
about thirty five dollars a month for a

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,800
pathetic one megabit per second

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,480
connection and that's without promotions

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,860
or bundle deals you know sometimes I'll

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,090
give you a really cheap price at first

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,090
but then they'll jack up the price later

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,360
so there I know I mentioned other

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,370
countries have higher speeds twice that

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,410
speed is available in Denmark and Canada

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,150
for lower prices and many Southeast

00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,770
Asian Nations have significantly faster

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,120
speeds like 50 megabits hundred

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,400
megabytes per second for like twenty

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,000
dollars a month to me this is

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,740
inexcusable there's no reason for that

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,510
so there are people that are trying

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,220
different ways to getting people access

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,430
to the Internet and there are a number

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,160
of ways of doing so some organizations

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,960
have worked with local universities and

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,910
expanding their networks into outlying

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,380
area so they'll take their backbone and

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,730
they'll connect it to people that live

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,280
in the community outside of the

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,250
university others have lobbied their

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,920
municipal governments for free basic

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,320
Wi-Fi and others have implemented

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,990
grassroots community maintained wireless

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,970
networks the community maintained

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,580
wireless network model is probably the

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,540
best model in my opinion because it

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,670
empowers though in low-income

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,660
communities by putting the technology as

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,430
well as the administration and

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,460
responsibility of this technology in

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,020
their hands essentially it's a

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,540
strengths-based approach to closing the

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,460
digital divide and strength based

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,960
approach I mean it takes the strengths

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:58,660
that people have and shows them how to

00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,220
take care of themselves it's essential

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,200
for an organization or collective

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,990
efforts success that clients receiving

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,060
services are empowered there are part of

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,770
the decision making process and are

00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,390
allowed to guide the direction of the

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,920
decision making process so that it might

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,970
help recipients in the most appropriate

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,700
manner this is also the most affordable

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,140
and sustainable model of implementation

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,860
for a small community such as a

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,970
subsidized housing block according to

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,260
research conducted on

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,909
community-based wireless network

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,370
sustainability is considered to be a

00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:32,080
critical issue when addressing lack of

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,090
Internet access and the best model for

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,480
continued success of the network and the

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,980
community accessing it is through

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,299
network model that the users themselves

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,289
play an active and participatory role in

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,090
wireless mesh networks enable a

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:48,190
continued community-based approach that

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,110
fosters social interaction and this

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,020
social interaction enables continued

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:56,860
social support and these wireless mesh

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,929
networks they're catching on in st.

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,940
Louis Missouri the wasabi net project

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:04,000
established a publicly owned to maintain

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,150
wireless network internet cooperative in

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,390
one neighborhood the coverage area is

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,070
it's small but wasabi net has been very

00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,750
successful in securing grant funding for

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,309
its initial deployment of wireless

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,900
services as well as the provision of

00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,640
desktop computers for low-income

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,380
families so they can have the internet

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,370
as well as the computers to access

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,900
another example is a 51 open which is a

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:33,159
community wireless networks serving the

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:35,650
East Bay region of San Francisco and a

00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,390
really great story is in 2006 the

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,080
champaign-urbana community wireless

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,460
network a coalition of developers and

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,679
community volunteers partnered with

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,110
southern california's tribal digital

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,669
village to establish a wireless mesh

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:54,280
network covering the Mesa Grande

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:56,740
reservation home of the KU my tribe the

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,480
network has supplied the reservation

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,510
with much needed access to information

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,809
and services the reservation is a ninety

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:08,049
percent poverty rate its remote location

00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:11,740
bars postal service and cellular phone

00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:14,260
coverage so getting wireless internet at

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,760
least to them was a much needed

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,850
implementation so they could connect

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,700
with the outside world and access social

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,470
services if they need and lastly the the

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,200
most relevant example I could find other

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,120
community-based wireless network can be

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,549
found in Michigan where the previously

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,990
mentioned digital Justice Coalition

00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,870
installed a wireless mesh network in one

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,800
Detroit Community the project used open

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,190
mesh wireless net

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,180
working to provide affordable internet

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,890
access through a shared infrastructure

00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,330
this easily implemented affordable

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,790
network as a real example of how

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,010
communities can use technologies and

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,170
business models to extend internet

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,650
access and improve improve community

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,870
cohesion this is key a key part of

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,100
having a wireless mission network is

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,110
that the community really does come

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,610
together around it they work together on

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,140
learning how to implement it they work

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:13,990
together on how to maintain it it

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,610
becomes a community effort the digital

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,190
justice coalition found that this

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,840
wireless mesh network exceeded their

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,200
expectations and that the implementation

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,840
was fast and problem-free and an

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
interesting finding from the DJ see was

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,280
that the community engagement was

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,870
actually more dependent on familiarity

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,620
with neighborhood collaboration and

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,150
actually with technology itself a key

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,160
lesson gained from wireless network

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,410
implementations is that success for

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,760
these wireless networks came from a

00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,410
devoting the majority of time and

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,780
resources to community engagement and

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:50,350
development with technology used as a

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,380
backbone and tool support wireless mesh

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,360
networking is an excellent model

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,790
requires minimal resources and banks on

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:04,030
a high rate of socialization and civic

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:06,730
participation remember I had discussed

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,830
cars and railroads and how they helped a

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,600
certain group of people and not and not

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,490
another just by the sheer chance of

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,610
location where they decided to build a

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,580
road over the side of a railroad tracks

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:20,830
there's a significant difference between

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,110
even the technology of these analogies

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,390
compared railroads cars and internet and

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,280
computers computers in the internet

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,830
differ from railroads cars and even

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,480
Telegraph's or telephones and that

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,640
individuals do not necessarily have to

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,210
be tied to the makers of these

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,480
infrastructures and services many of us

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,070
certainly are in this digital age we pay

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,520
for access to the internet through an

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,260
ISP or telecom and we trade liberties

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,070
for free services such as email or

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,540
social networking but the biggest

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,910
difference between these

00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,620
historical technological inequalities is

00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:01,360
that we as a people now have a choice

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:03,700
over what we can do we have control over

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,710
the means of production we have control

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,330
of our software and we are beginning to

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,060
have control over actual hardware

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:13,410
through 3d printers and similar devices

00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:19,020
and the free and open framework

00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:21,640
established by free software activists

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,410
helps build communities as seen through

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,930
the efforts of online information and

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,510
software collaboration such as Wikipedia

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,400
it's a great example and computer

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:34,480
recycling and open mesh network building

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,800
if we don't use collaborate the

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,500
collaborative framework if we don't use

00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,690
this free and open framework we will not

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,560
achieve digital justice because as John

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:47,290
Rawls said social justice is the first

00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,000
virtue of social systems and we're all

00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:55,120
the part of the social system we call

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,560
modern society the free collaborative

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,270
framework set forth by the free software

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,960
movement fits well into the established

00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:03,310
ideas about community development so

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,840
right here that Community Development

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:09,720
terms run around quite a lot I'm sure

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,890
you do it's it's a buzzword for sure

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,660
community development is an aim of

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,220
social justice and requires community

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,650
involvement when working with internal

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,800
and external influences like free

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,990
software community development is a

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,110
multi-faceted comprehensive approach to

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,940
community change Community Development

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,040
aims to increase social capital not

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,100
yield maximum economic return for

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,720
shareholders the community development

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,610
framework encourages using local

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,350
resources in a way that enhances

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,300
economic social and political

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,870
opportunities while improving social

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,830
conditions in a sustainable way

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,680
community development frameworks are

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,780
always implemented to increase social

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,490
capital for the disadvantaged to

00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:55,870
overcome crisis or just to strengthen

00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,730
the community many social scientists

00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,290
psychologists anthropologists and

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,540
journalists argue that technology is

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:04,780
beginning to isolate us in different

00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,429
ways many of them go by the mantra that

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,529
the more digitally connected we

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:11,950
are the more socially disconnected we

00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:14,230
become I don't believe this is really

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,909
true I believe that we were just

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,860
changing the way in which we communicate

00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,899
and technology is actually giving us

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,899
more opportunities to broaden our social

00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:27,129
connections I can log onto IRC and talk

00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:28,419
to somebody in China if I wanted to this

00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:30,159
will not have been possible without

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:35,139
having a computer and an internet

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,139
connection recent research is suggesting

00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:40,419
that I might be correct in my humble

00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:42,399
assumptions studies are showing that

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:45,070
technology is not as socially isolating

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,690
as we think it is just take the surge in

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,749
popularity of social networking in

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,190
recent years as an example people are

00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,440
beginning to realize and few computers

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:57,399
and technology are an extension of

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,169
ourselves and there are tool used to

00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,639
communicate with one another and a more

00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:05,259
efficient manner with this movement

00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,850
toward becoming more digitally connected

00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:08,619
we are reminded that there are billions

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,230
of people without access to a computer

00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:13,119
in the internet i dont rember that exact

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,259
percentage but i think it was 29.5 or

00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,999
something like that of people that are

00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:20,259
actually have internet access and that's

00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:22,269
a significantly small number and the

00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:23,799
ones that don't have access to the

00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:27,399
Internet are the ones that are isolated

00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:30,039
not us it's our responsibility to bridge

00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:32,259
the divide so that this class system of

00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,940
digital haves and have-nots does not

00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:35,940
continue it does not grow

00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,239
we as the technologically knowledge

00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:49,570
knowledgeable many of you in here I

00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:51,459
believe are are responsible for creating

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,369
the engines of change for digital

00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:56,109
justice we do not have to go out and

00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:59,499
create a wireless mesh and network or

00:27:56,109 --> 00:28:02,440
found a computer recycling nonprofit to

00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:04,959
work towards digital justice but we

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,359
can't do very small things such as using

00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:08,820
free software exclusively supporting

00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,539
free software projects through code

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,249
contribution documentation bug reporting

00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:19,329
education and even money money is good

00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:20,709
for free software it does help we should

00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,509
reward those that contribute to free

00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:25,809
software projects that we continue to

00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:27,759
have free software we should support

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,249
free formats and boycott products that

00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,139
do not respect our freedoms we should

00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:34,569
educate the public on the reality of the

00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:37,569
digital divide and that it is as issue

00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:39,729
of social justice and the dangers of

00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:41,829
so-called free services that exchange

00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:45,489
liberties for no cost applications and

00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:47,499
services if we do have the time we can

00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:49,239
start a computer recycling operation or

00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:51,759
create a small computer lab at a local

00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:54,369
church or even upgrade an existing one

00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,929
with free software we can help our

00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:58,289
neighbors with their computer lowes via

00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:00,369
free software open format alternatives

00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:03,759
there are many different things we can

00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:05,199
do but what we cannot do is sit by idly

00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,219
while those who do not have access

00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:10,690
continue to become more disconnected the

00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:12,609
free framework of sharing information

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,619
and collectively owning and contributing

00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,690
to it is key to the digital justice

00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:19,690
concept that all individuals should have

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,819
equal access to media and technology and

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,629
it is the only way that digital justice

00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:27,459
can be achieved if we allow major

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:29,259
corporations that refuse to share their

00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:30,969
source code or kurose into coerce

00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,519
individuals into trading basic rights

00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:35,049
and liberties for no cost services to

00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,449
continue their stranglehold on the world

00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:40,839
economy will never achieve digital

00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:42,489
justice and equality for everyone if

00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,859
this becomes more common and I believe

00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:48,989
it will the case for a free framework

00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:48,989
and free software will be even greater

00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:55,359
I'm standing up here today because I had

00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:56,230
a computer in my house and when I was

00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,790
very young

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,090
and also had a computer in the classroom

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,400
and the first grade the computer this

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,010
computer my school my teacher it really

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,660
empowered me it powered me to become

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,950
interested in technology and my

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,110
education and I'm here because my dad a

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,760
hard-working Forester decided on a whim

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,309
to get a computer for my sister and I

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,570
back in the early 90s so we could

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,100
harness the power of the knowledge and

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,160
knowledge of the nascent world wide web

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,049
and educational software my father

00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,270
doesn't know this but to me it's the

00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:33,520
most important financial choice and

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:35,440
decision he ever made technology it's an

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,750
incredibly empowering tool if it is

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,929
utilized properly and that is for the

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,390
common good it's our responsibility as

00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:45,059
technophiles geeks nerds academics

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,950
engineers programmers designers

00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:50,559
advocates and anyone else interested in

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,690
digital justice to advocate for those

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,490
that are digitally disconnected to fight

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,429
for free formats to fight for free

00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,929
software in fight for a free web because

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,630
it's rapidly becoming the backbone of

00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,110
our society some might argue that it

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,110
already is

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:22,450
and what good is knowledge and education

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:24,250
if we don't share it right I have

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,650
witnessed through my volunteering and

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,780
being involved in community projects

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,380
what collective action and free software

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,700
can really do for people and communities

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,230
it's a really wonderful and touching

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,929
feeling to see somebody interact with a

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,280
computer for the first time to help see

00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,429
someone give it over their fear and

00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,470
mystery of technology to see a newly

00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,850
formed or veteran nonprofit or advocacy

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,370
group get computer equipment that they

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:51,760
really need so they can go and complete

00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:53,530
their mission and help other people or

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,150
see a family get a computer for their

00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:01,419
child so they can have an economic and

00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:03,610
educational advantage so in closing

00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,409
before we have questions I ask that you

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,419
join me in the fight for digital justice

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:10,390
I believe the future of our society

00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:12,760
depends on and I'll close with a quote

00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,909
from late historian howard zinn that

00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,890
said small actions when multiplied by

00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:20,039
millions of people can transform the

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,039
world

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,220
so if anybody has any questions throw

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,220
them at me

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:44,130
absolutely yeah and you mentioned North

00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,090
Africa you know I think things might

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,100
have been a little bit harder to shut

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,380
down if it was more decentralized and

00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,640
they weren't using proprietary

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,710
frameworks like Facebook and stuff like

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,370
that I've been I know that they use

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:59,100
utilize Twitter which medium to

00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:03,060
communicate but it's difficult to

00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:06,390
explain to people the negative aspects

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,130
of software as a service or services

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,120
that you know trade liberties to use a

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,250
software you don't have full control

00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,020
over then to me that stifles

00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,920
communication although it's as you

00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,790
mentioned it's open and you can

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,350
communicate but who truly owns your

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:23,430
communication that's that's something

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:25,260
that we all should should be cognizant

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:29,400
of and what other people know about as

00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:36,690
well thanks for your anybody have any

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:38,760
other questions yes pay for wireless

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:43,620
okay i know i'd mentioned several

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:49,800
several different ways what's what oh

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:52,350
sure you can contact an internet service

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,850
provider there they might not be willing

00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,130
to work with you some are some aren't

00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:58,200
you just approach them say i'm trying to

00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:02,250
set up a wireless open mesh network and

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:07,710
share is that would show that switch

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:10,980
your questions it's it really depends on

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:14,520
the area you asking me personally what I

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,990
think should be done or I mean I think

00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,790
there should be free basic internet

00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,170
service for everyone yes I think that

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,060
there should be a tax for that but

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,310
that's my personal opinion now other

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,800
people are getting around that loophole

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,200
with setting up open mesh wireless

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:33,080
networks because they can't afford you

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,080
know connection sure

00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:40,900
again it depends on which framework

00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,270
you're using if you're using open mesh

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,250
wireless networks several open mesh

00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:47,380
networks they have set up to where they

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,180
have advertising on each web page and

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,190
they gain advertising revenue from that

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,600
or they have a grant they get from a

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,120
foundation that pays for internet access

00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,310
for you know five years or they set up

00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,480
business models around that so there are

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,190
different ways that you can pay for it

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,850
to me that's the best way than having to

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:05,560
tax somebody or write grants is to build

00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,750
into the open mesh wireless network

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,390
framework from the start a way to pay

00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,980
for it sustainably and one of those ways

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,990
is through advertising I've seen that

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,970
done quite a bit you know you have a

00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:18,520
login page that you go to right and

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,990
there's ads there and that's how you pay

00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,470
for the internet or you can charge

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,830
people a dollar fifty cents you know

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,880
they live in a subsidized housing block

00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:30,580
so there are different ways you can pay

00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:35,230
for things taxation is it's an extreme

00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:37,540
measure to go to but I think the more

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,030
grassroots ways of doing it are probably

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,190
more effective but more efficient Center

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,190
your question yeah

00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,490
oh sure

00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:07,620
no that's fine thank you for your

00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,620
question

00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:22,640
yeah sure yet I apologize for not

00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:24,289
repeating the question basically there

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,140
has been the communication about how to

00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:28,489
extend internet access to people in

00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,199
communities different methods of doing

00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,969
that you're saying that there's a

00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,199
necessity for this just because they're

00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:36,140
the sheer amount of people that have to

00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,900
dial a phone number and that's that's

00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,279
one of the reasons that I feel that that

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,929
this concept of digital justice is so

00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:44,359
important because social services are

00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:45,650
all moving towards the Internet not just

00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,019
I mean even social service with just

00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,189
anything yeah oh do you have a web sites

00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,269
one of the first things people think of

00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:52,900
you know i'll just look you up on the

00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:55,900
web if you don't have that than your

00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,900
question

00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:15,710
it yeah so the question was is how

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,710
secure our free open networks is that

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,570
hmm

00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,539
sure

00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,609
right so how secure is our the network

00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,300
so the open mesh I mean it really

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:58,500
depends on how the network is set up

00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,599
some communities that will have login

00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,339
information you know so it's restricted

00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,940
to the housing block that were at the

00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:07,800
wireless mesh network is set up so it's

00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,260
really up to the people that are

00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,030
maintaining it so you could have a very

00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,760
unsecured network or a very secure

00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,190
network but again that is an issue of

00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,990
like Liberty you talk about your on that

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,220
network so your your traffic is going

00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,200
somewhere and somebody could sniff those

00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,210
packets for sure it's definitely

00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:31,770
something to consider I'm talking about

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:33,420
open 10 we mesh networks me not

00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:37,050
necessarily I would see what the people

00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,670
would want to do first see what they

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,170
would like explain to them the issues

00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,640
involved and if they feel that they're

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,819
comfortable with having that and let

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,540
them have that again I'm coming from a

00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:49,410
social work perspective so we always

00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,300
communicate with individuals to see what

00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,339
their needs are and go with what they

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,490
want even if it might not be the best

00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,490
choice

00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,500
sure

00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,920
so how do we get people to see the value

00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,990
of the internet the importance of the

00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,630
internet and our daily lives yeah it's

00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,130
so that's a really great question I mean

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,720
some in some ways it's just when

00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,730
somebody hits a roadblock they realize

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,590
you know oh I didn't need an internet

00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:18,220
access at this time or they see a friend

00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:20,020
that has a computer but the best way to

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:28,860
do that is it's that's kind of difficult

00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:28,860
I mean you could sure absolutely

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,420
yeah only thing I could think its

00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,150
advocacy like you're talking about

00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:30,440
reaching out into communities showing

00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:31,940
them the benefits of net access but I

00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,680
mean to me it almost has to come at an

00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,970
individual level you know personal

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,890
individually will have to realize though

00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:40,730
I do need a computer you know i do need

00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:42,350
internet access that what I'd start talk

00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,790
about costs and athens you know a lot of

00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,070
people do want it but they just can't

00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,560
afford it too expensive when you're

00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:51,110
living on public assistance you know you

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,360
can't can't get by you got to pay other

00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,120
bills it's hard to pay fifty dollars and

00:46:53,360 --> 00:47:00,440
forty-five dollars a month for internet

00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:02,530
it's just too too expensive comment or

00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,530
question

00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,900
we got to take a quiz or something right

00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:10,900
to kind of test yeah

00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,570
your question is are there lobbying

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,830
organizations around that protect you

00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:21,270
know like look for open source interest

00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:23,900
yeah there's a vons hero foundation

00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:27,330
they're a very active organization the

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,260
electronic frontier foundation eff eff

00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:33,210
dot org they're very very involved in

00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,310
internet civil liberties protecting

00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:37,200
people they go to court for like

00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,630
copyright infringement whatever else you

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,390
can think of and then of course there's

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,130
the Free Software Foundation some people

00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:46,010
might argue how effective they are but

00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:50,700
they are a organization that is

00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:53,850
representative of free software but

00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,740
there's no particular like a lobbying

00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,390
group that has an office in DC you know

00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,490
that's like hanging out like waiting to

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,620
jump on legislation that would be nice

00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:05,400
be really nice but it's just not there

00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:08,250
and you asked about funding I think eff

00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,410
and anybody can jump in here eff and FSF

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,210
they get mostly donations and they sell

00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,430
play products like t-shirts and books

00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:16,560
and other things like a lot of its

00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:17,970
donation and grant based work but there

00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,430
are organizations out there that are

00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,740
working towards or this eff is probably

00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:25,110
the best example I can think of

00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:29,550
personally anybody's going to chime in

00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:35,540
as anything else open source for America

00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:35,540
yeah yeah sure

00:50:35,759 --> 00:50:48,160
cool I wasn't familiar with that open

00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:53,160
source for America okay great any other

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,160
questions comments throw things at me

00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:03,299
okay oh yeah another sure

00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,790
yeah so grassroots can hold you back but

00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:57,190
it could also be a great thing because

00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,720
it's it's very honest you know you can

00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,190
do a lot with it the more you grow the

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,990
more you become tied to maybe grant

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:04,810
people are funding you free grant so now

00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:06,820
you got to answer to them right so i

00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:08,290
think it's it's been incredible the

00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,570
amount of work people have done together

00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:13,000
to have a completely free operating

00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:15,520
system that runs well you know better

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,380
than some proprietary stuff just by you

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,390
know volunteer work some get paid some

00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:22,210
don't but just the sheer aspect of

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:23,800
sharing and that's what I like for

00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,120
everyone to come today away with

00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,740
something the concept that you know

00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,990
there are people that need help and you

00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:33,480
can use free frame marks to do do these

00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,480
things sir

00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,020
yes read the word about computer

00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,670
donations and look for organizations in

00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,130
your area don't ever throw a computer

00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:00,490
away mail it somewhere if you have to we

00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,490
have another question

00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:59,249
no I yeah that's semi be good

00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,099
yeah that would be interesting to find

00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:09,630
out because from my imperson to you that

00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:12,490
it's it could kind of fallen off yeah so

00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:20,609
right yeah that's it but yeah be

00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:20,609
interesting to find out yes sir yes

00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,719
right

00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:36,160
so it's allegedly but i recently found a

00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:38,829
loophole that i'm going to try to get

00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,869
through and this is a question about you

00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:42,309
know again university is in a town you

00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:44,200
know there's a lot of stuff they

00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:47,049
normally have computers to stack on

00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,210
pallets I just like go off to be

00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:54,640
recycled or surplus sold at auction you

00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:56,589
know that kind of thing got it so there

00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:02,970
is a form may be at the universe where

00:54:56,589 --> 00:55:02,970
are you you're in Athens okay there is

00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:06,789
there's a form that you know they have

00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,890
different charitable organizations we

00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:10,900
have to prove that we're serving a

00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:13,240
certain kind of population so we might

00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,380
have to do is like means test people to

00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,690
like check to see what their income is

00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,069
but once we do that we get some data we

00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,599
can throw it to the University and then

00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:22,089
we can get access to all those computers

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,589
are there that would solve our donation

00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:27,220
problem like you're having need

00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:29,859
donations right if there's a university

00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,539
or Community College near you contact

00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:33,309
them and see what they can work out

00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:35,829
especially since you're under a 501c3

00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:38,140
that always helps you only have to be a

00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:39,910
501c3 nonprofit to do that kind of thing

00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,210
it qualifies a charitable organization

00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:45,900
but let me get your contact information

00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,900
before you leaving

00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:02,010
we did a small small open mesh in a

00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:05,520
low-income housing community did yeah so

00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:07,020
did we do thank you for that d have we

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,950
implemented open mesh wireless network

00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:12,420
yes we have very small but it's been

00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,760
fairly successful something I don't know

00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,550
if you're involved but yeah we did we

00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,230
got some actually the Clark County

00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:21,780
School District actually approached us

00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:24,540
about doing that and we set up a small

00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:32,430
small one but I would like to see it

00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:33,630
done more so we found individuals within

00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,400
the housing community that were

00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,990
interested in becoming leaders in the

00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,110
community they were already more likely

00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:42,660
leaders themselves anyway show them how

00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:44,790
to set up the network maintain it and

00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,740
they became the community liaison for

00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,860
open mesh wireless network so exactly

00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,090
what I talked about you teach people

00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:52,470
it's very very simple maintenance you

00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:53,970
know something really goes wrong they

00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:58,200
can always contact us you know we're in

00:56:53,970 --> 00:57:00,330
the community to help so but it's a very

00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,980
very small one I haven't heard much

00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,430
about it since then I think there's no

00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,140
funding for it no to continues just one

00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:09,240
mm-hmm yes it's one connection but I

00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:12,260
think it's a larger more business line

00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:14,520
so you have higher bandwidth you know

00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:16,050
everybody within like a certain part of

00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,400
the housing community gets access to

00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:19,590
that cloud because it's only going a

00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,440
certain way you put more wireless mesh

00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:24,360
where outer is you can expand it more

00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,990
that's the beauty of it turn it on and

00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,990
it just kicks it over

00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:44,930
okay thank you all for coming hey drew

00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,940
thank you I appreciate

00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,580
what about this I can help you like it

00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:10,350
we have the same problem or whatever

00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,350
level to do you gave me I found

00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:16,720
let's put the word out

00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,720
you

00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:31,309
as a service leader in cloud computing

00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,900
all we do is hosting computing to us the

00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:34,849
cloud is just the next generation of

00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,799
hosting and if someone who's been in the

00:59:34,849 --> 00:59:38,750
hosting industry for 12 years we feel

00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,920
we're in a unique position to really

00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,049
help bring these two worlds together

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,390
these different sets of technologies and

00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:46,700
to help companies embrace this new world

00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,710
and this great new tool that allows

00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,319
faster innovation not only is it about

00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:56,329
us being responsive and accountable but

00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:59,089
it's about us doing more for you whether

00:59:56,329 --> 01:00:03,079
less an OS that works the way that you
