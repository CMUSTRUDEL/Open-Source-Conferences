We all know Linux goes hand in hand with DIY.  Just as tech on TV is ridiculous, building a tiny home in real life isn't the same as on TV. I built a house from foundation up, 440 sq ft, fully permitted and approved by the local county. Going from IT Pro to self contractor require the same structured thinking.

those dimensions in the unit I'll have

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,080
to get a special wide load or tall load

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,320
or heavy load permit which are extremely

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,139
expensive so most tiny home on wheels

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,480
are built in a very specific form factor

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,810
which is extremely limiting when your

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,210
entire width is 8 feet and you know when

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,010
you factor in a couch if when you're

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,820
sitting in it it is 3 feet and then you

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,670
need space in front of it so 8 the what

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,230
you see on TV is actually a very extreme

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,960
niche which I don't think is applicable

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,550
to hardly anyone but it makes for good

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,250
television which which is why you see so

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,739
much of it timeline we found the land

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:49,590
and put a offer in right before

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:52,469
Thanksgiving there was 60 days of do due

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,149
diligence which one of the biggest ones

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,370
for our due diligence I'll get this in a

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,350
minute is finding no deed restrictions

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,969
which are basically restrictions that

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,879
previous owners of the land placed on

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,330
little placed on the land which D which

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,490
is legally binding on what I can do with

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,650
the land that I currently own so a

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,770
previous owner can dictate what you as

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,830
the current owner can do with the land

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,290
clothes on the land in January and by

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,520
March had the driveway and foundation in

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,920
our driveway is 12 feet wide by over 300

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,579
feet long and because of budget reasons

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,130
we went with gravel we got close to 200

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,970
tons of gravel which fortunately for us

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,720
we are less than 5 miles from a concrete

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,390
recycling plant so we can get it for if

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,299
I remember right it was $400 for a 20

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,630
ton load delivered which is an extremely

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,450
good deal we had to the driveway we had

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,470
the drywall and paint done by July and

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,810
for most houses the drywall putting the

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,570
drywall up is typically half way through

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,070
the building process because the paint

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,409
that finishes the floor is the cabinet's

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,570
the fixtures all that takes just as much

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,930
time as it does to frame the house and

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,500
put the exterior put all the insulate

00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,180
we had to move in in July when we moved

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,730
in we didn't have a functional kitchen

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,020
didn't had time ran out of money

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,480
bathroom fortunately did function ended

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,610
up using a laundry sink as our kitchen

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,930
sink and we did have the stove one

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,630
refrigerator but no cabinets new

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,140
countertops and we did that for almost

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,930
six months and then finally in January

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,190
of 2008 our kitchen was installed and

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,290
and we get it certified and permitted by

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,150
the county and and they gave us our

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,890
certificate of occupancy which means we

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,890
could finally gain insurance on the

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,410
house insurance will not insure a house

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,180
without a certificate of occupancy

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,850
because well they need some insurance

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:03,050
that you built it up to the local code

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:06,209
finding the land was rather challenging

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,980
the you gotta you gotta locate it you

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,250
got to find the utilities and then the

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,660
deeds and restrictions the utilities is

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,650
a big one this so a lot of people don't

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,600
realize is where you put your house can

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,560
dictate dramatically the costs of the

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,140
utilities in my case I to connect to

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,100
Duke power I paid a thousand dollars to

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,560
connect to the city water and paid three

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,780
thousand for my septic now if I had

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,519
built any place that was much further

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,489
off the road it could have been thirty

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,370
forty thousand dollars for just to bring

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,010
the power in and so for me there was no

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,930
upfront cost because I power right at my

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,540
driveway though those utilities finding

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,390
a property with utilities readily

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,320
available is a huge factor we happen to

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,900
have 3.41 acres of mostly former

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,120
farmland the deeds and restrictive

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:09,000
covenants is most deeds if you find it a

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,040
deed or a covenant basically it was put

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,850
in by most likely a subdivision

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,970
developer and they they can state

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,799
basically whatever they want and back

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,330
down the 50s the covenants actually said

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,610
that you know this is why this

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,250
neighborhood is for white

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,280
people only and that's how they kept

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,479
segregation going the developers would

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,460
put those rules in and those who are

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,800
enforceable up until the sixties when

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,629
that was deemed unconstitutional but

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,639
some of the restrictions you'll see is

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:39,199
you know you must have three thousand

00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,319
square feet of heated square footage

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,719
must be tube two floors that must have a

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,419
drive must have a garage it must be

00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:50,300
brick it must must must must must all of

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:52,219
those must can drive up the cost so if

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,590
you can find property without be

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:57,379
restrictions you can now suddenly have

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,439
the freedom to do what you want within

00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:02,449
the county's rules and these deep

00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,840
restrictions are put there by a previous

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:08,240
owner and typically a deed will specify

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,139
how you remove it and most are you have

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,210
to contact either the original deed who

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,669
who wrote the deed or their descendants

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,379
if that D was put in one hundred years

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,650
ago you would find the living

00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:25,279
descendants of that person and they have

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:33,620
to agree for a new covenant to get one

00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:38,750
in place yes so it is typically enforced

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:41,919
by your neighbors and if your neighbors

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,029
don't care then yes but if you built

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,529
knowing there with the deed restriction

00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:49,219
and maybe you had neighbors who didn't

00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:51,620
care at the time but a year or two down

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,719
the road you pissed them off they and

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,219
they look at their covenants and go oh

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,699
you weren't supposed to build that they

00:05:55,219 --> 00:06:02,210
can then sue you in court in civil court

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:05,360
when and you now have to make the

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,460
modifications to bring up to the

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,779
covenants this is how HOAs power is

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,199
through the covenants without a

00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:16,099
covenants HOAs have no power and that's

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:20,719
I have a particular thing for HOAs for

00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:22,580
this very reason so this is what the

00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:26,300
property looked like in December on this

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,460
is standing near the very back and up

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,130
towards the middle is our where the road

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,459
and our driveway is we have we only had

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,620
50 foot of road frontage and our county

00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:38,740
required that we put

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,980
20 foot driveway so where it met the

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,050
road we had 20 feet and our County

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:49,360
allowed us to do gravel all the way up

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,620
to the road now this is what it looked

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,810
like in February and this is actually

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,430
our grading contractor he's the one who

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,310
put in the driveway and the foundation

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,310
and so that that's the path of the

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,260
driveway you can see my car parked up on

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,750
the road because I obviously couldn't

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,730
get it back there and that's what it

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,820
looked like after he so he scraped away

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,940
the topsoil to get down to the bare clay

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,830
and I requested that he put in it's

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,710
called geotextile fabric it's a very

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,590
strong fabric that they put on top of

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,690
the dirt but below the stone and it

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,620
keeps the stone separated from the rock

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,570
or the dirt and he said that if I hadn't

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,570
on that way he would he would had about

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,190
doubled the amount of stone because the

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,960
mud was so squishy it would have just

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:40,660
been all compressed down into the mud

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,540
and this is I laid this out on the house

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,530
so this is the corner with our concrete

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:50,080
stoop I later replaced that with a deck

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,600
and the dimensions that the house is 22

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,800
feet wide by 20 feet deep that is

00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:00,190
smaller than most people's garages and

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:04,690
so one of the things I did is I went

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,280
ahead and dug the trenches and this

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,470
particular trench is for the water line

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,930
running along the driveway and while I

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,050
had the trench open I went ahead and put

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,210
in conduit for I got now I pull up by

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,220
the driveway which has power in Ethernet

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,530
to it so I can run cameras access points

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:27,550
and whatnot yeah I have an access point

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:29,230
just for my yard so here I put this is

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,400
the foundation the particular foundation

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:35,560
that we chose mainly due to cost is it's

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,750
called a monolithic slab so the footer

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,170
which is the white part which supports

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,290
the weight of the walls is in the same

00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:47,230
poor as the slab and so it's slab on

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,000
grade it is about the cheapest way you

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,430
can put in a foundation

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,430
this size and you'll notice the shipping

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,560
container about a few about a week after

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,180
this picture was taken the shipping

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,530
container was broken into and I had

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,420
about two thousand dollars worth of

00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,890
tools and material stolen out of the

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,870
container that that event delayed the

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,780
entire project by over a month because

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,610
after that happened I was unwilling to

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,650
have over ten thousand dollars worth of

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,020
lumber and building materials delivered

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,430
to the property without some type of

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,780
assurance that this wouldn't happen

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,320
again

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,090
and so this is right here this is I

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,700
basically jacked up the container

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,710
because I had to level it those jacks

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,120
each are capable of supporting 20 tons

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,670
they're called railroad jacks they have

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,200
a very small foot so you can go

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,880
underneath the container while still

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,880
sitting on the ground and I'll Jack it

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,080
up the container by itself is 8,000

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,120
pounds empty the container itself cost

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,940
about 2300 delivered and that was at the

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,500
time so paying for a house like this and

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,330
this is something else that doesn't get

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,070
very widely talked about in the

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,890
especially in the tiny home shows they

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,240
almost never talked about financing and

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,640
so they leave you with the impression

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,920
that all these people have 80 thousand

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,620
dollars cash to drop on a tiny home on

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,270
wheels so a couple different ways of

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,600
paying it some of the big ones are

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,070
obvious is cash loans and mortgage and

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,980
other types of financing that would be

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:18,670
friends family or personal lines of

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,550
credit I paid for I paid for the land

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,050
cash I paid for about half the building

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,410
cash and then I took a personal amount

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:30,640
of credit unsecured to pay for the rest

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:33,930
of the building so this is what it

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,250
looked like in March and in the delay I

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:40,620
set up and there'll be picture of this

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:43,000
later I set up a solar panels to power a

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,270
camera system that was installed inside

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,080
the container and I had to go solar

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,300
because I I didn't have even a temporary

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,710
power this come at this time the power

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,740
company was running about eight weeks

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:59,440
behind so I was to do the construction

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,790
part I was running on a generator but

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,610
you obviously you don't want to leave a

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,220
generator running too

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:09,050
4:7 so the cameras themselves the

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:11,779
cameras the server were all powered via

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:15,950
a solar panel and a bank of batteries

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:20,570
and all had pictures of that when you

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:23,839
lay out a driveway or anything it's good

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,610
to pay attention to slopes and I don't

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,800
know what I was thinking but I didn't

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,050
quite pay attention close enough so I

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,120
unfortunately put our driveway in at the

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,000
lowest spot of the entire property and

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,860
this is after one of our nice afternoon

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,160
showers where we get about an inch of

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,079
rain in 30 minutes and that results

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,200
about in 6 or 8 inches of standing water

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:50,720
that mistake cost me over $10,000 to fix

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:55,100
later and extra trenching grading piping

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,140
and putting in a retaining pond so some

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,589
of these mistakes can really do cost you

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,180
a lot of money so this is setting up for

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:07,790
the putting the gable ends on the walls

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,079
for mine I went with the walsim selves

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,910
at 10 feet which is taller than a

00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,589
standard standard houses but with

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,529
eight-foot lumber I built with 10

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,060
because being a smaller physical square

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,190
foot I wanted to give some more vertical

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,949
to help make it feel better and then in

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,890
the main area where the kitchen and the

00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:27,290
living room are I've altered to 16 foot

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:32,240
so it would be taller than these

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:34,160
ceilings and one thing when you build a

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,540
project like this there's always the

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,940
regrets of what you should have done

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,839
what I've shipped so what you see here

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,579
is the two gable and stacked on top the

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
front Gable wind has the windows I

00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,199
should have put a gable I should have

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,089
put windows on the back I didn't and now

00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,160
it's ungodly expensive to do it now

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,410
where then they would have cost less

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,370
than 200 bucks but now it's a couple

00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:00,709
thousand to do it so this was talking

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,949
about with the solar panels I did four

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:06,699
solar panels at 250 watts each forth out

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:09,740
for total thousand watts of solar

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:13,940
coupled with batteries that I got on a

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,840
heck of a deal I got 32 batteries for

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,330
less

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,160
and 600 bucks and they were still had

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,400
factory warranty basically what happened

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,950
was a local news station their batteries

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,140
had expired in their UPS so they had a

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,750
company come out and put new batteries

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,170
in their ups and this is one of the you

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:35,630
know powering a TV station six months

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,250
after that they after the new batteries

00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,170
they got new equipment which made a new

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,790
higher power demand and so they had to

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,600
get new battery they had to get a new

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:47,570
UPS and so the gentleman who installed

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,070
the new UPS said it's it be ashamed to

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,470
have to scrap all these batteries and

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,990
say we're only six months old so I got

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,270
them for less than the scrap value I if

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,400
I wanted to I could have paid 600 to him

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:02,330
drove them to the scrap yard and got 800

00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,980
of them but I kept them total weight was

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:09,200
about three thousand pounds of batteries

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,550
on the 32 of them permitting we have we

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,270
got a building permit from Spartanburg

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:16,430
County which is our jurisdiction when

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,010
using their property stay out of the

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:23,630
city limits cities almost always impose

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:25,220
restrictions on size setbacks and

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,020
various things which just makes building

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,960
a lot more complicated more expensive so

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,510
stay out of the city limits we had to

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,020
get a DHEC septic permit which is the

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:39,200
South Carolina Department of Health and

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,390
Environment something like that and that

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,650
they're the ones who they in South

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,440
Carolina you're not required to get a

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,520
perk test or a percolation test

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,690
basically what they do is they come in

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,510
with a hand or hand pour sampler they

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,150
sample down to sixty inches and lay the

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,890
dirt out in a line as they find it so

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,220
you can see the different layers of the

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,990
clay and the guy would take the

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,690
different layers rub them between his

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,910
fingers to find how gritty it was

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,010
compare the color to a book he has and

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,510
based on that information because yet

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,830
you can put a septic tank here it will

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,150
work up to performance so that in states

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,950
and jurisdictions that require a

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,420
percolation test that could be a

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,880
thousand dollars because you have to

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,580
bring someone out with a backhoe you've

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,160
got to dig a hole that's four foot it's

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,990
got to have a shelf to

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,230
you can step up and out it's got to be

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,730
this why this deep this high so that's

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,860
another thing to look at which will

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,980
cause prices to you know the cost to

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,290
drive up there's land use ordinances so

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,480
in our case there was very minimum but

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,370
they basically drill down to you know

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,019
you can't build a house you know one

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,089
foot away from your property line

00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,370
you know if they think things like that

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,319
which having three and a half acres you

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,480
don't have a problem with and then yet

00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:00,019
we had to get a driveway access permit

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,660
from the county and are in our

00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:06,350
jurisdiction our area the signs are

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,199
marked with different logos it'll be the

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,149
state crests or the county crest or even

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,160
a city Chris and basically who's ever

00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:15,079
crest that is that's who owns and

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,329
maintains that road thereby that's who

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,480
you have to give permission to put

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:22,790
basically a driveway on that road and

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,889
sometimes they can have Spartanburg

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,459
requires us to put in a twenty inch

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:31,910
concrete culvert under our driveway in

00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:34,220
that they it has to be concrete high and

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,899
it's got to be 20 feet so that these are

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,370
various restrictions that the counties

00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:43,189
can put on or state or city on so this

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,189
is what it looks like in April did let's

00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:49,310
get the sheathing it's got the roof

00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:51,860
framed out and there's a nice red clay

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,310
mess all around and we're still dealing

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,899
with some of that now and here just more

00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:02,300
framing again this what looks like an

00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:03,470
April the scaffolding so I should have

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,230
did a little more research

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,829
when you rent scaffolding they charge

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,360
it's close to $100 a week however if you

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:17,110
go we got that we get this particular

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:20,390
unit it is 16 sorry it is 12 feet tall

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:24,289
get it at Northern Tool for $500 for the

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:27,400
entire set which we and I the

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,950
scaffolding for over three months so

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,480
saved a ton of money by returning the

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,980
rented scaffolding F for a week and

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,350
going buying the scaffolding here's with

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,970
the received anon

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,470
and you can see our little storage

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,510
closet on the back which is where we

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,010
keep the hot water heater we have a

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,460
tankless hot water heater which is

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,809
plumbed in with propane we don't do it

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,780
we don't have gas service at our house

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,429
one of the most frustrating things with

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,160
building the house is dealing with

00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:04,789
contractors and I and on the Upstate of

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,350
South Carolina it is a very the density

00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:08,840
of new houses it's very high they are

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,419
there's a constant demand for new houses

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,419
and most contractors that are good are

00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:16,580
almost always busy booked up months and

00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:19,250
months of vans and when you have a

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,799
smaller job like oh we only need a

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,650
twenty by twenty two-foot concrete slab

00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,030
poured it's not worth it to them for the

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,400
most part to come out and deal with it

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,440
when they can they can drop my job and

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,120
go do another job that pays five times

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,070
the money because it's five times as big

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,280
so dealing with contractors was

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,690
extremely frustrating and that is one of

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,929
the things that drove me to do most of

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,850
it by myself is because I couldn't get

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,350
anyone to come out and do it you know I

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,429
even if I paid them now I couldn't get

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,409
them so in in even today one where we're

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,809
thinking we're doing the plan to build

00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:56,110
the main house soon and again dealing

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:58,520
with contractors and architects

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,950
I was talking with an architect two

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,929
weeks ago and they said sure we'll build

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,120
your house but it'll be in a year and a

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:08,059
half when we can finally start on it I

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,679
mean before they'll even commit to

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,789
saying they'll build it it's you know

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,830
they'll put you on the schedule for a

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:18,049
year and a half out so this is in May

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:21,200
and moving time moving into the house is

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:24,020
less than 60 days away at this point you

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,480
can see the bathroom is framed here on

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,179
the upper picture and the bedroom is

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,289
framed on the lower picture and above it

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:34,730
is a loft when I first was planning it I

00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:37,220
wasn't sure what I was going to do with

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,840
the area above the bathroom I wasn't

00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,260
sure if I was gonna vault vault ceilings

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,309
or what but after looking at the space I

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,770
realized that for only about you know

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,750
$300 in lumber I could build me a loft

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,580
that is that still has enough space

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,270
where I can stand up in it

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,580
we

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:59,020
sleep up there we only use it for

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,700
storage and a low Bextra lounge space

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,700
also when you talk to your permitting

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,250
agent agency don't tell them that anyone

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,960
sleeps up there because they were to get

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,410
it inspected you got to have a stairs

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,110
that is three feet wide which would take

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:19,190
way too much space so sometimes it's a

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:21,920
gentle gentle lie to the agencies so

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,270
this is after the type X's was on and

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,830
the door was installed this was a very

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,710
happy moment for me because at this

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,050
point it was water-resistant so means

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,790
the inside was mostly dry and the

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,860
biggest thing is it was now secure

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:39,350
it was now lockable which was a big deal

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:41,090
for us here's a little bit of networking

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,040
these are network cables I put in the

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,730
black ones being exterior-grade Ethernet

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,600
it really ones being cat six we have

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,090
four cameras installed on the exterior

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,180
f4 of the house and they basically look

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:59,090
on each side there are no cameras inside

00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,470
and I put in a network drop about every

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,180
place I could possibly think I could

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,150
ever need a network drop so there's one

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,510
behind the TV there's there's two by the

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,340
couch there's one by the bed there's

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:13,250
there's a bunch upstairs in the loft

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,900
there's even a Ethernet installed into

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:20,270
the ceiling so I can mount my access

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:22,340
point and all of the wiring inside the

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,380
cabinet is or inside the walls is

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,240
stapled just like you would do an

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,890
electrical cable so this is a we still

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,110
in Bay and you can see the plumbing for

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,420
the laundry we ended up going with a

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,820
stacking washer and dryer so even though

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,140
when 440 square feet we get a full size

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,640
washer dryer we get a full-size

00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,780
dishwasher we got a full size sink a

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,780
full size stove and a full size

00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,780
refrigerator and we still have pretty a

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,240
decent amount of kitchen space and given

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,860
the given it's only 440 square feet I

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,330
think it's amazing just how much kitchen

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,000
we actually did manage to squeeze out of

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,040
it for the plumbing I went with all pecs

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,030
because it is a lot easier than

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:05,570
soldering copper and pecs is extremely

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,140
durable and when it freezes it does not

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,030
burst

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,340
because there's a little bit of give in

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,280
that plastic pipe so it will expand and

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:17,780
not bust which can be a huge help if you

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,490
run water lines underneath yes they will

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,980
freeze you will lose water but you will

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,000
not have a giant repair bill because you

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,280
had water spraying all over your house

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,500
one of the mistakes I made and my

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,400
inspector is so helpful and pen painting

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,940
pointing it out was you were you are

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,810
required 18 inches from where you put in

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,300
the the water the drain line from the

00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:47,810
clothes washer you have 18 inches from

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,640
that point to the trap at the bottom

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:54,680
because they've a washing machine can

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,540
force water out so fast that if you

00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,910
don't have those 18 inches water will

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,440
come spilling out and so I didn't

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,630
realize that at first and I put it up

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,070
higher and I ended up having to cut out

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:11,390
work and redo it

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:13,520
to get it lower to pass code and again

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,250
there was multiple inspection points

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,090
there was an inspection of the before

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,330
report concrete I had to get a termite

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,740
company to come in and put down a

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,540
termite repellent underneath the

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,550
concrete slab and I had to have a

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,440
certificate from the termite company to

00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,080
show the inspector that that Apple that

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,120
product was applied and what product it

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,160
was because it that product itself was

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,440
being of wood had to be approved by the

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,180
county there was an inspection of the

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,310
concrete slab after it was poured it was

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,250
a inspection of the framing there was an

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:48,520
inspection of the wiring there was an

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,350
inspection of the plumbing there was a

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,120
expection of the insulation there was an

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,800
inspection when you were finished there

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,600
was an inspection of the roof and all

00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,150
these inspections have to be scheduled

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,690
and you require at least 48 hours notice

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,190
before they show up my problem is is I

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,830
would have to schedule these during the

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:10,100
work day and they don't call you to give

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:12,740
you notice that you're coming and so and

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,760
they have to have free access to the

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,710
structure to be able to do these

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,780
inspections so doing the logistics of

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,450
getting to meeting the inspector during

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,870
business hours

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,190
was challenging to say the least

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,470
utilities we have city water grid power

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:29,070
coax internet from charter and a septic

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,680
tank again I already told you that we

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,930
went with grid grid power because we

00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,230
paid nothing upfront for it yes we do

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:41,060
have a power bill but in order to go off

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:44,460
the grid is a you have to change how you

00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:49,320
live your life no air no air

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,660
conditioning no big propane tank and

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,220
propane tanks Oh propane is extremely

00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,290
expensive it's something dollars a

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,300
gallon and when you have a thousand

00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:00,540
thousand gallon tank it's rather

00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,940
expensive forget it filled or for this

00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,100
so or if you do want to go off grid and

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,560
keep having your normal things like your

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,090
dryer your stove your dishwasher your

00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,940
air conditioning you have to spend a ton

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,430
of money upfront to gain the inverters

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,660
or solar panels and the batteries and

00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,080
the batteries don't last forever they

00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:23,250
last for five to ten years so it's spend

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,200
50,000 60,000 upfront or pay you know

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,640
fifty sixty two bucks a month from my

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,130
power bill I pay for the power bill and

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,710
for the wet we had the choice of a well

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,560
or a city water connection the city

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,480
water connection is was a thousand

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,270
dollars and it's guaranteed that I will

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,180
get water after I pay for that with a

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,220
well you're not guaranteed anything they

00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,860
can come drill and they can drill drill

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,620
drill drill drill drill and never find

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,800
water and so you have and you pay them

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,000
for every foot they drill and if they

00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,500
don't find water they have to go to

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,880
another location in drill drill drill

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,350
drill drill and so you can you can that

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,100
about the minimum that I've read was

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:09,660
about five thousand four well and it can

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,040
go all the way up to twenty thirty

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,890
thousand depends on how deep they have

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,770
to go what type of conditions do they

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,960
find if it's real loose rock they may

00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,640
have to put in a con they have to may

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,070
have put in a steel sleeve which then

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,620
you're paying per foot so in our case

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,500
city water was the most cost-effective

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,030
solution and when I chose the property I

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,580
made sure that I would be able to get

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,370
real Internet

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,990
and so right right by our driveway there

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,080
was a nice charter line that ran on the

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:41,660
power lines so I knew immediately that I

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,900
would be able to get real internet not

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,550
not that satellite internet so this is

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,820
what it looked like in June we went with

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:52,250
a metal roof I like the look and it's

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,340
also extremely durable that particular

00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:57,679
metal roof has a class 4 hell ring which

00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,910
means it can with stain a two inch hail

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,340
stone without breaking one thing that's

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,090
interesting about metal roofs is after a

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,730
hailstorm

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,410
it may be dented but your instruments

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,150
will not pay to replace it because it's

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,700
not structurally damaged it's only

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:16,190
visually damaged unlike with an asphalt

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,770
shingle roof it is structurally damaged

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,870
after a hail storm but not a metal roof

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,270
the metal roof should be good for close

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:26,960
to 100 years and then the siting I went

00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,550
with Hardy board cement board you don't

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,880
have to paint it it doesn't rot it

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:35,330
doesn't decay almost effectively zero

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,970
maintenance and then for the trim I went

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:41,330
with PVC or metal I have no exposed wood

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:43,460
I have nothing to paint ever all of it

00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:46,220
has factory images I wanted something

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,400
that I did not have to do maintenance on

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:52,130
ever and the cable you see that going

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,570
across is going between the house and

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,250
container and this is holding up

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:58,040
Ethernet so that I could have a camera

00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:00,020
on the front door of the house and it'd

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:04,910
be recorded and powered from the

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:07,040
container I did all the electrical here

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,110
I made a mistake and I should have went

00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,179
with a bigger panel

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,300
it's very cramped in that panel in that

00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:16,940
panel is now full it's a 200 amp service

00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,790
from Duke and you can see all the wires

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,570
that we ran in the ceiling running in a

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,570
such a square

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,700
such a small square footage means

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,350
everything is real dense there's a lot

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,860
of wires in a very small area and

00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:33,200
because a lot of the the city codes in

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,750
the the permit the National Electric

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,840
Code states that you must have certain

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,790
things be met first is all those

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,350
breakers with the white labels those are

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,510
arc fault ground fault which are

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,059
required in bath anywhere where an

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,159
outlet is

00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,499
water like a bathroom and kitchen and

00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,059
that's the GFCI and the art fault is

00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:54,299
required in any place someone would

00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:56,490
sleep so living room and bedrooms an art

00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,710
fault is basically if you screw in a

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,970
nail or something like that that does

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:05,039
not short it but maybe it causes a

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,570
little bit of arcing it'll trip the

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,999
breaker basically what it does is it

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,879
looks at the sine wave of the power

00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,610
that's that's going out to the outlet

00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:16,289
and back the breaker is and is analyzing

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,470
it and it cut if it's out of Tolerance

00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:21,899
it'll cut it off same with GFCI it sends

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,850
power down the positive if the if the

00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:26,519
same amount of power does not return on

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,340
the neutral power is leaking somewhere

00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,860
and so the ground fault would trip those

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,549
breakers are 60 bucks a pop so when you

00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,019
have to have six in our case I didn't I

00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:39,179
didn't quite understand just how

00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:40,740
expensive those breakers were that was a

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,860
bit of a shock when I had to go buy that

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,809
many and the National Electric Code also

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,720
demands that even though we had a small

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:52,740
kitchen we need to have two separate

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,029
circuits each at 20 amps and same thing

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,070
in the bathroom yet have a 20 amp

00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:58,919
breaker in the bathroom because of hair

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,480
dryers and other things so the National

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:05,279
Electric Code you have to understand the

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:09,299
codes enough to pick out the highlights

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,369
of what up what is political to you and

00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:14,429
this what looked like in June we are

00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:17,100
less this picture was taken less than

00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,590
two weeks before we moved in we cut it

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,899
extremely close and was very stressful

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,820
and our wedding reception was right

00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:28,769
around the same point because we were

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,840
crazy this what looked like in same

00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:33,019
thing in June with more insulation and

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,580
the bathroom installed we went with a

00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:40,139
four-piece bathroom surround with the

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,909
bathtub being extra deep and after

00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,320
living with that window I would highly

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:45,330
recommend if you can ever put a window

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,129
in the bathroom particularly in the

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,080
shower area it's very nice in the

00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:52,320
morning to have that natural light I

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,869
really do like that and this is what it

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,220
looked like pretty close to moving we

00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,539
didn't have all the insolate we didn't

00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,910
have all the siding down we didn't have

00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,280
the face

00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,860
we didn't have this off it's done but we

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:06,490
had air conditioning we went with a mini

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,590
split it's 18 thousand BTUs which is

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,920
roughly a ton and a half and I installed

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,990
that I did have to contract a company

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,110
I'm an HVAC company to come in spot

00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:22,000
about lines and vacuum before the freon

00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:24,430
could be released and this is the

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,630
drywalling another company did drywall

00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:30,130
getting drywall right is an art and

00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:33,010
anyone who's done it knows just how

00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,990
difficult it is and unfortunately our

00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,180
drywall contractor wasn't all that good

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,760
and we ended up with a pretty crappy

00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,880
product which is going to cost us when

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:47,890
we do have to go fix it later

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,330
and here's painting my god I didn't

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,550
realize how much I hated painting until

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,380
I had to paint this place that is one

00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:56,410
thing I wish I could have paid someone

00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,350
else to do being 16 foot vaulted

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,390
ceilings was real fun to paint doing

00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,010
that much trim work and that much detail

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:07,210
I don't have the patience or the skills

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:08,620
for that and I'd rather I wait I shoot I

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,790
wish I could have paid someone else to

00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,830
do it but at the time money was

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:17,190
extremely tight so that wasn't an option

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:19,660
this was a glorious day I'll tell you

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,820
finally getting the permanent power

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,490
installed to the house I could turn on

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,630
that air-conditioning unit again this

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,310
was July it was a very hot muggy July

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:33,850
and once we get that air conditioning

00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:35,680
turned on it ran for a very long time it

00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,690
felt good

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,470
and so this is right around the time we

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,380
moved in you can see no landscaping was

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,820
done we got the propane tank installed

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,570
there were some siding that wasn't done

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:51,550
and the porch wasn't done

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,650
we were never and this is after we moved

00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:57,160
in we had never thought about putting a

00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:00,370
porch I'm glad we did it looks the house

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,230
looks a lot better now that with it but

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:04,270
the reason we ended up having to put the

00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,100
porches and is because before the

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:09,280
drywall went up we had a way that bad

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,530
afternoon storm real strong winds and I

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,020
was inside the house I could watch the

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:17,410
front wall because it's 16-foot tall it

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:21,310
was flexing in and out by over an inch I

00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:25,230
was like oh crap that's how good so I

00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:29,350
was like how can i reinforce this wall

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:32,650
and not and do the least amount of undo

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,270
of my current work and there's all types

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,130
of bracing all types of steel that you

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,950
can do inside but all of that has

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,580
consequences with the finishes and cost

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,730
and delay so I was like oh I'll do a

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:50,800
porch and so Wow before I put the siding

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:52,750
up I put the header up and basically

00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,030
it's it's already pre screw it's already

00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:59,620
drilled into the wall and they were when

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,920
we first tried to get insurance on the

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,310
place after we'd already passed a

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,930
certificate of occupancy so the county

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,130
passed it like this they were fine with

00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,560
it they didn't care about this the

00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,780
insurance company came around they sent

00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,370
an agent out and they said all this

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,360
house ain't finished we're cancelling

00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:21,460
your policy you have a week and so I

00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,990
scrambled and I eventually found State

00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,929
Farm there was a local insurance

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,520
adjuster who I showed the pictures to

00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,200
and I explained the situation oh yeah I

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,840
can write a policy for that here we go

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,429
and less less than an hour turnaround I

00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,100
had a new homeowner's policy because I

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,050
after spending $30,000 30 40 thousand

00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:44,500
dollars on this my nightmare the entire

00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,970
time was I'm gonna come home and I'm

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,200
gonna come to this structure and there's

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,470
gonna be nothing left because it burned

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,280
down and I'm out all of my money so I

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,720
did go with the homeowners insurance

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,730
policy it was actually it's pretty cheap

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,070
so we're now in October so we've been in

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,190
the house for a while due to finance

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:06,310
finances I a lot of these projects on

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,890
the outside had to wait until I could

00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:11,650
rebuild the cash to be able to pay for

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,680
all this because I had maxed out the

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,380
line of credit at this point so you can

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,830
see that the AC lines aren't covered the

00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,700
the the boxing the frame for the fascia

00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:26,900
and the soffit is fed

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,030
and here you can see with it all wrapped

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:33,080
in metal so again there was no exposed

00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:36,860
wood and yeah it's a minute it was a

00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:41,030
mess so much mud in the house from the

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,440
dogs so this is in November we

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,930
originally went with the laminate

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,550
flooring I will warn you the inexpensive

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,050
laminate flooring that you find for less

00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,390
than a dollar a square foot is

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:55,760
absolutely utter when it comes to

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:58,310
water within one month we had the

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,520
laminate flooring around the front door

00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:04,250
was swelling and bubbling and rippling

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,420
and so I had to bite the bullet and I

00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:13,220
had to rip all of it up and here you see

00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:16,550
we chose to go with a garage epoxy paint

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,760
directly on the concrete the gloss

00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,790
didn't hold up as well as I would hoped

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:27,200
it's it's now matted as times gone on

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:29,420
but it's real difficult to grasp what

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,270
had to happen to take this to do this I

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,210
had to move all the kitchen contents out

00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,410
and put them where well they all got

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,860
stacked in the living room and around

00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,630
the bed and so for for a while this for

00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:45,770
the setup and the drying of this we were

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,790
it was extremely cramped so this is what

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,010
it looks like after the kitchen got

00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,990
installed this was a happy day and I

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:53,060
finally have this you can see our

00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,790
stacking washer and dryer or kitchen

00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:58,160
cabinets and the island was actually an

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:01,400
interesting find Costco was selling

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,110
those for 200 bucks as a workbench for

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,600
garage I'm going this is too freakin

00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:11,630
nice to be in a garage it's got a nice

00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:14,480
wood top and big heavy steel frame so

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:18,040
that became our island because the space

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,630
is being an L it's rather big and and

00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,060
the island helps tie it all and together

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,370
and again all the appliances are

00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,190
standard full-sized residential

00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:30,320
appliances there's no special tiny tiny

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:34,180
things I actually do enjoy cooking and

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:38,650
so I needed the full-size appliances

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:44,440
I love the subway tile backsplash in the

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:46,359
kitchen and now and this is January 2008

00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,470
and I can finally start doing some of

00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:53,289
the exterior work and I did not want any

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,849
shrubs or wooden mulch up against the

00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:57,520
house wood mulch up against the house

00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:02,410
attracts termites and the shrubbery

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,990
itself can because it's shading it can

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:08,230
cause mildew and stuff like that to grow

00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:10,359
on the siding and also again being

00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,640
terrified of fires and being have a

00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:15,130
giant grass meadow which burns really

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,069
easily I wanted to have a non Bernal

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:20,950
Bowl buffer so I have a 4-foot buffer of

00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:23,170
rock all around the entire exterior of

00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:28,690
the house to serve as a little bit of a

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:31,180
buffer and this is part of the fixing

00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,250
the mistake of the drainage I had to put

00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,289
in a retaining wall which you see on the

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,900
side of the house I had to put in over

00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:41,650
600 feet of piping to help direct the

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:45,460
water away from the house and away from

00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:49,690
the driveway and here's building the

00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:51,640
porch I weigh oversized the lumber I

00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:56,260
went with 8 by 8 pressure treated wood

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:58,630
which is just ungodly huge in reality I

00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:02,170
probably could have got away with four

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,500
by sixes and so this is what the deck

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,760
looks like after we'll mostly finished

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:10,480
ended up going with a composite wood

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:13,450
decking so it is actually recycled

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,690
plastic and recycled sawdust that they

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,690
form and press it does not rot you do

00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,670
not to paint it in it's virtually

00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,760
maintenance-free and it's got a nice

00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:28,869
hidden fastener system but it's not

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,970
cheap and this is again June so we've

00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:33,359
been in the house for pushing a year now

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,829
and we finally get to finishing the loft

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,010
finding our way up the loft was rather

00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:43,059
interesting because I wanted something

00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,260
that was out of the way and there was

00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:45,309
you know of course you could have looked

00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,030
at building something or having

00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,980
something custom-built

00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:52,160
Allisyn actually ended up finding this

00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:55,730
ladder from warner it's it meant it's

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,790
meant to put in a old house as well it's

00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,120
a attic access ladder but it's what's

00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:06,650
cool about it it doesn't fold out it

00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:08,960
slides up and it's narrow so it doesn't

00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,860
take up a lot of space and got it for

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,160
less than 200 bucks

00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:16,100
so and then for the railing we did wires

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,920
this is a utter mess this has been

00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,300
cleaned up now so remember those

00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,820
batteries I was talk about over here oh

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:26,390
they are there's some of the batteries I

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,880
ended up doing a whole house UPS and it

00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,650
backs up my refrigerator the lights the

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,830
a/v equipment the controller the

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:37,280
tankless water heater for about eight

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:41,990
hours and they switch fast enough that

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,030
computers don't realize that it's under

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,590
five milliseconds so the computers are

00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:49,490
fine with it

00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:51,110
but yeah that that has been fixed so

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:56,260
this is what this would look like an

00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:58,520
August finally got the window trim done

00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,440
we live for close to a year without

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,500
window trim or without the trim around

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,150
the windows and it does make it look a

00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,790
lot more complete getting the window

00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:10,940
trim and so there's our bedroom you can

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:13,160
see is on the other couch and we also

00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,960
made a run to Ikea and got some

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,580
furniture and I get a great because they

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,080
should do make furniture for smaller

00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:24,830
spaces and this one looks like today I

00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:27,920
am slowly trying to replace our grass

00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:30,740
with something non grass so right now we

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,000
have 16 apple trees - pear trees five

00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:38,900
pecans six grapes bunt probably 20 berry

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,760
bushes you know and a garden that's in

00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,670
the back that's about 10,000 square feet

00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,820
it's a hundred by 100 so it is 20 times

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,840
the size of my house I know I'm crazy

00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:51,740
but we'll have a lot of corn and

00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,420
watermelon this year and I'm and between

00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,180
the trees again I don't want the grass

00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,630
so I've been replacing it with wood

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:02,420
chips and perennial flowers

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:05,810
so total cost the land was twenty seven

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,060
thousand five hundred for 3.41 acres of

00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:11,980
forest Farber County

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:15,020
I am only five minutes from eighty five

00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:17,270
everything else the house and all the

00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:22,070
construction costs fifty thousand so

00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:25,160
total in were at seventy seven thousand

00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,760
dollars which is what we were appraised

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,980
for

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,800
I think the appraisal is a little long

00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,900
because how they appraise the house as

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,700
they compare it to comparable houses on

00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,890
the market at the time and so they

00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,810
compared us to two houses one house was

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:46,010
built in 1928 and was 1,100 or no it was

00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:48,260
900 square feet in a really rural area

00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,140
near a rural than us and the other house

00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,600
was built in the 40s and was 1,100

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,490
square feet when you try to appraise a

00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,710
440 square foot house there's not many

00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,570
comparables but we were appraised at

00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:03,560
77,000 I think it's actually more than

00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:05,960
that future plans so again we have the

00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:10,790
three and a half acres we are we have

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,840
started I've done the building and I

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,360
know I don't want to build the main

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,960
house myself because I know how much

00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,170
work that is

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,670
so we are contracting that out and we

00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,680
started that process and we hope to

00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:24,470
start construction this time next year

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,450
the beauty with having this studio now

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,910
on the same property is we can put it up

00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,070
for rent being only five minutes away

00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,410
from two major hospitals that employ a

00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:36,140
lot of traveling nurses traveling nurses

00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,630
get a disposable per diem income for

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,180
housing that in most cases was well over

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,890
two thousand dollars a month so I will

00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,740
be able to rent by fully furnished or

00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,900
util is included all the way down to the

00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,820
linens and dishes furnished for about

00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,020
sixteen hundred a month which will more

00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,780
than cover the mortgage for the main

00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:56,660
house so within five years

00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:00,020
I should be debt-free mortgage free rent

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,090
free uh no my house and have $1,600 a

00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,540
month and income to pay for everything

00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,290
else

00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,290
woo

00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:15,009
so here's more information how to

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:18,730
contact me when this video is posted to

00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:22,089
YouTube I will also post that link to

00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,819
that Google draw the photos folder which

00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:32,230
has three hundred plus photos of the

00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:34,480
entire process yes I was fortunate that

00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,400
they they did not adopt a new coach

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,289
while the process was going on

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,299
typically a building permit is issued

00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:45,579
for a year duration and you were

00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:47,859
typically locked into the codes that

00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:49,720
were applicable when you applied for

00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:51,490
when you were issued your permit it

00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,079
so if halfway through the building

00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,299
process if you're still within that year

00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,369
they chained they went to an updated

00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:59,349
like a new electrical code you were

00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:01,180
still backdated because you got your

00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:08,950
building permit before that I'll come to

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:12,640
you say yes so I didn't find the plans

00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:17,529
myself I did look at a ton of plans to

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:21,190
get a layout I purchased a software home

00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:23,950
designer it is for Windows it was about

00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:26,140
120 bucks but it allowed me to draw out

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,299
the walls place the different stuff

00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,700
within the within the structure so I can

00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:32,170
see our IES a queen bed is going to fit

00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:39,339
here with two feet of space on either

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:42,579
side yes those are my neighbors and if

00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:44,769
you go to the craft tea share we brought

00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:46,869
some of his honey to share with everyone

00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:48,759
he's got about eighty hives he gets

00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,559
about 200 gallons a year and sells it

00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:59,619
for about ten thousand dollars a year

00:45:50,559 --> 00:46:01,630
not bad for a hobby so I would probably

00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:07,990
not have been able to get a contractor

00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:09,430
to build a house this small and so I

00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:13,509
would have had to go into a bigger house

00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:16,210
a bigger house without land would

00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:17,710
probably pushing a hundred thousand so

00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,390
one hundred and twenty something with

00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,730
the land but I would end up with a

00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,500
bigger house much more than I want

00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,240
and said about the only way I could

00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:44,770
truly get what I want was doing it

00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:49,660
myself price and foot and this is also a

00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:52,630
very small space so I knew that Gigabit

00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:56,140
Ethernet would be fine probably for the

00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:58,630
life of the house again it's 440 square

00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,400
feet probably in the future it's only

00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,170
going to have an access point I mean

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,000
especially after I rent it out there

00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,920
none of the renter's are going to be

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,900
plugging something in in the main house

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,850
I will be putting ether will be putting

00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,480
conduit in because I'll be running fiber

00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:20,560
to various locations where I want more

00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:23,740
than one gig yeah yeah I didn't run any

00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:27,310
coax because I knew I'd never be

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:32,610
subscribing to cable TV service so I

00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:35,610
didn't bother running coax inside yeah

00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:35,610
yes

00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:50,110
finding finding the actual codes is

00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:51,760
extremely difficult so there starts all

00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,520
the code start at the national level and

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,440
then each jurisdiction will modify them

00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,540
so there's the national building codes

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,550
then there's the south carolina building

00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,830
codes which they'll take the national

00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,600
codes and go these things are not

00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,310
applicable we're removing them but these

00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,730
are applicable so we're gonna add new

00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:12,220
rules then the county can add new can

00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,990
also change the codes and the city can

00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,760
change the codes I was fortunate I

00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,860
wasn't in city limits and my County did

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,210
not change the rules they adopt they

00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,910
straight adopted it from the state

00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,770
however to get the actual text of the

00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:27,160
codes even in an electronic format would

00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,210
will be over 200 dollars per code so

00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,470
that's two hundred dollars for the

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,150
plumbing code that was two hundred

00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,800
dollars for the electric code it was two

00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:36,099
hundred dollars for the for the framing

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,460
code so there are

00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:42,430
sections of the code in various places

00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,559
where people using my citations but

00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,960
honestly where I got most of this was I

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,400
love this old house growing up and I

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,400
watched I've been watching this old

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,799
house probably since 95 and seen pretty

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,710
much every episode and so a lot of it

00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:59,410
was just learned knowledge about you

00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,250
know that walls are 16 16 inches on

00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,430
center

00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,470
outlets or I think it's 16 inches high

00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,140
off the ground out lights have to be

00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,779
every six feet you know or every 12 feet

00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,400
and you know a lot of them was just

00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:15,099
learned knowledge over time because I

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,869
couldn't I could not access the codes

00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:19,299
even if I wanted to because I certainly

00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:26,170
wasn't gonna pay $200 to get access to a

00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:28,390
PDF yes the cameras I use are the BIC WA

00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,740
T which are these are actually my home

00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,579
surveillance cameras that I brought with

00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:37,240
me I am falling out of love with the BIC

00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:40,839
WA T cameras I think they were good at

00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:43,299
the time when I when I got them but

00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:45,960
there are better cheaper options now if

00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:48,480
you find an MBR software that you like

00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:52,630
I'm testing a new one that's open source

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,730
then once you go to a non-bender MBR you

00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:58,930
can you can gain access to a huge

00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,819
plethora of cameras the one I'm finding

00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:05,559
right now that I like is it's like H I K

00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:09,819
something else 150 bucks for a outdoor

00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:12,579
POA camera that's got five or six times

00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:15,369
the IR range that these cameras have for

00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:17,019
only $20 more because these cameras 130

00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,210
bucks which i think is outrageous for

00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:26,740
what you get for them and so I'm moving

00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:28,359
away from them to something else very

00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:31,119
actually very little I would do the

00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:34,150
odds-and-ends project with my dad but

00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,130
again most of it was just watching this

00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:41,000
old house which I can't say how much I

00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:52,880
love this old house did you have no one

00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:55,010
I did all the framing so I was there on

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,180
site every day that any work was getting

00:50:55,010 --> 00:51:02,360
done I did have my father to help and a

00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:03,850
family friend helped mainly it was

00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,830
mainly with the physical labor

00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:08,150
stained standing up a 20-foot wall

00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:11,470
that's ten feet high

00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:13,910
if there's a lot of weight and it's it's

00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:17,360
impractical to do by yourself so I did

00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:29,570
have some physical help a little bit

00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:32,180
from the father-in-law from the wife so

00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:34,010
most I'm fortunate that my father did

00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,480
have a lot of tools and I basically

00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:39,800
cleaned his garage out of tools and as

00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,350
time has gone on and I've gotten more

00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,450
financial resources I have replaced his

00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,840
tools with my own and returned his back

00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:51,470
so yeah there's I mean other than a

00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:53,420
sliding miter saw and a drill those

00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:58,430
those were the two main things that came

00:51:53,420 --> 00:52:00,050
in used for the tools so I'm actually

00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:02,060
giving a presentation on home automation

00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,670
where I'll go all into the home

00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:14,200
automation aspects that talk is tomorrow

00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:14,200
I believe in this room good

00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:25,830
on the main house no but our our

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,740
property is zoned for we can put 2.5

00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:30,720
homes per acre freestanding homes on our

00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:33,000
house we have three we got three half

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:38,040
acres so we in theory could put almost

00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,470
11 homes on it so after I built this

00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,630
studio or after I built the main house I

00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,640
have been discussing about building a

00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:55,380
second studio on the property for rental

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:58,530
purposes that's just yeah it's quite

00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:00,510
cozy and as the building inspector must

00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:14,970
say you almost really loved each other

00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:17,640
so I paid cash for the property I then

00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:20,910
got a personal line of credit the

00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:23,790
personal line of credits or the interest

00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,220
they charge is just downright extortion

00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,470
it was twelve percent interest the

00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,880
advantage with a personal line of credit

00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,310
is you don't have to secure it with

00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,380
anything and them it's like a credit

00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:37,050
card so that the monthly payments is

00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,590
proportional to the amount of debt as

00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:43,200
soon as I get the building inspected and

00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:48,390
insured I refinanced it into a home

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:51,330
equity loan at 6% and moved all the debt

00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:53,010
out of the home equity loan and into the

00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,170
resort out of the personal line of

00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:05,070
credit into the home equity loan thereby

00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:06,840
dramatically lowering the interest so I

00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:10,550
worked it out with my employer that I

00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:14,160
would work four days ten hours each I

00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:17,100
would I would get off work at 6:00 I

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,100
would go go to the building site work

00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,260
until about 10:00 drive an hour to the

00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:25,350
apartment get home about 11 o'clock and

00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:28,430
turn around and wake up at 6 a.m. to go

00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:31,350
to work I did this for three months and

00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,850
it was extremely exhausting and and I

00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,150
took Friday Saturday

00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:39,450
I took Friday off and I worked all day

00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:43,230
Sun up Sun I stopped sunset Friday

00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:45,600
Saturday Sunday and Mantid from from the

00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:51,000
time when the first stick of lumber went

00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:54,360
on to we moved in was four months yeah I

00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,130
know I was crazy I didn't realize I

00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,970
don't quite realize what I signed up for

00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,970
until it was too late

00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:10,680
so the insulation I wish it could have

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,680
done better and I know a lot more about

00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:17,130
insulation now than I did then I did go

00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:20,250
with fiberglass your standard and

00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:24,060
required in our area is an r-13 bat and

00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:27,570
a 2x4 that's the minimum I did find a

00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:30,420
vendor that had a ar-15 within it that

00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:33,960
could still fit in a 2x4 base so I ended

00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,360
up it is from Johnson Manning I think

00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,640
it's a company turns out they actually

00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:48,090
manufactured it only only a few miles

00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:50,790
from the house it's all the questions so

00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:55,920
the the power bill would come in at

00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:59,310
about 60 a month propane we feel once a

00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,380
year about every eight months between

00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:05,550
every eight months to a year when we

00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:09,020
fill it it's about 300 the water bill is

00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:12,450
bimonthly so it's about $30 a month and

00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:16,550
45 or 50 for the Internet so overall

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,550
it's pretty reasonable

00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:26,839
so the propane is only for the tankless

00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:29,089
hot water here yeah and one big misnomer

00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:32,480
with tankless hot water heater it's not

00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:33,799
instant but it is unlimited we hadn't

00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,200
say it's not instant is because you do

00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:38,480
still have to remove the cold water

00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,869
that's in the pipe before the hot water

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,390
arrives but you can truly run it forever

00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:47,539
as long as you have propane one thing

00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:49,339
when we first moved in we I like a nice

00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:52,039
hot shower so I bumped the hot-water

00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:55,549
heater up from its default 120 to 130

00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:57,230
made for very comfortable showers but we

00:56:55,549 --> 00:57:00,200
were burning propane faster than I ever

00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:05,420
thought I like what's going on

00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:07,789
and we now keep the hot water at 114 and

00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,529
we went from having to fill the tank

00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:16,190
every three months to every 12 months

00:57:09,529 --> 00:57:21,049
just by turning it down there is but it

00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:25,369
requires a hundred and forty amps of

00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:28,519
power yeah that I mean basically you

00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:34,160
have to have a 200 amp service and then

00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:37,069
it uses well it uses 40 amp breakers and

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:41,180
it will use three to four of these 40

00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:43,099
amp breakers and it's it's the river and

00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,589
and the ticketless hot water heater we

00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:47,420
went with a medium efficiency it's rated

00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:49,609
at 9.8 gallons per minute

00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,420
your average shower is only three

00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:52,160
gallons a minute

00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,420
so it it's we can basically run

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,190
everything in the house with hot water

00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,259
and still have plenty left over I weigh

00:57:55,190 --> 00:58:00,109
oversized it that was my mistake it only

00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:01,279
cost about a grand in in hindsight we

00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:04,730
could actually gotten away with about a

00:58:01,279 --> 00:58:13,249
$300 tankless going down with a smaller

00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:15,739
unit yes so we went our tankless or

00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:19,970
nothing it's a mini split 18 thousand

00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:23,210
BTUs heat and cool heat pump it will it

00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:26,749
will produce heat with a temperature as

00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:29,569
low outside of five degrees it will so

00:58:26,749 --> 00:58:30,750
it'll maintain the inside seven degrees

00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:33,260
while the outside

00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:36,060
five degrees and that's heat pump only

00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,320
the the particular unit we chose it was

00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,590
a mistake

00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:45,870
it will only produce cold or cold air

00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:48,540
down to 58 degrees outside we pay about

00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:50,370
1600 for the unit there are newer units

00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:54,380
there are other units that will produce

00:58:50,370 --> 00:59:01,190
cold air down to five degrees Fahrenheit

00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:01,190
