should be good

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,990
focus on the projector

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,810
that's not my fault though clear clear

00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:33,550
about that one particular thing it is

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,550
technically possible for sometimes

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,100
didn't bring it okay

00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,879
I'm not late if I'm physically here I

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,879
counted it's not

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,700
all right so buzzword bingo blockchain

00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,380
says the guy doing right

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,920
you're silly tours

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,270
cheerfully

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,270
so pair

00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,590
it's not wrong

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,709
we're good issue

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,709
[Music]

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,650
okay now I'm totally ready

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,040
is everybody ready yep cool got all the

00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,040
bloopers

00:03:00,280 --> 00:04:09,790
so with this I don't have that so

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:40,160
so you can check out my shoes my first

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:56,290
website of my tailor

00:04:40,160 --> 00:05:02,110
so this functionality is important color

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:04,250
presentation is just power like orbital

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,510
perspective is when you're trying to go

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,880
regular so if you don't care don't worry

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,280
about this but it's not care about

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,200
anything any idea of use people using

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,910
your site or your software you need to

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:35,540
for example presenting annoying that

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:47,540
github makes gentleman sometimes but

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:49,550
everything you do is for Broncos

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,680
provided video opinions otherwise you

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,050
can but if you can at least do the

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,010
screenshot because otherwise hitting it

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,780
love that people are just going to get

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,030
bored Moodle and this means it's like a

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,620
lot of people also Higgins loving Marg

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,180
you should the motor content this means

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,890
is like a little justice not seeing a

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:08,650
lot of work to do marketing and air

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:12,050
content because is a lot of effort to

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,250
but it's always since I did it they're

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,890
also going to do

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,450
able to give you some contact so if you

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,780
care about what you're doing you want

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,280
think it's not literal remote it's now

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,950
we're gonna go to you it's not a luxury

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,590
you can do it some don't so do well now

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,980
we're gonna go to for differently so

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:35,600
don't do zoo marketing curving and

00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:37,820
building so so first of all to the reso

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,150
is not showing or anything ever done for

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,160
your brand do they do is make your art

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,050
and your design your grant I'm Waterman

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,020
and making what you're doing and make it

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,120
say like the colonel weight Tucker

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,990
displaying presenting your branding

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,210
don't

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,450
so wait 20 years okay you wait 20 to do

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:08,060
so

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:10,790
okay exam about 20 years to do they have

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,430
made how many just raise your hand if

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,520
you think that they have made three of

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,070
these over 10 the only thing that made

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,150
over baka you're all right it's over

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:27,080
over 10 so okay most all right or it's

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,850
over 15 or so like most of the opal are

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,400
this one's actually really great a lot

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,960
of efforts

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,850
it's couple ours this one's actually

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,040
managed in a lot of effort into an

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,560
entire sectional there's a pretty good

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,600
they match the song itself they have a

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,010
higher caste at that resembles the

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,630
people's they're doing the original like

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,100
it's a do that they do some dances that

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,360
are similar that gives some locations

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:56,979
that are good and they're like it's

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:58,780
really solid million so you're gonna

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,610
parity some songs that's fine we're

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,949
making it look so invisitech there's

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:13,539
also a saw a video that they can't stop

00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:16,150
the six there's also a next is so Katie

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:18,610
decided to rebrand their project on the

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,639
K destiny he means to you it's just they

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:27,479
changed the desktop as my so means

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:30,550
nothing in 2008 and we're here we're way

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,039
up to 14 with a glass of plasma five

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:38,110
repairs you okay so the larva pegylated

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,150
2014 and 2004 was the first surgeon and

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,659
they changed the kingdom i actually

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,220
suggesting the use and mmm where they

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,470
have i actually suggested they do this

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,720
because I found remember to clone them

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:58,270
where they acknowledge this by the way

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:59,770
today remember it's an initialism

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,900
meaning it's not an acronym

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,060
where is known so it's a just abandoned

00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,010
though meaning is that so here's some a

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,620
couple bachelors oh it's okay that's

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,230
Apollo West so here's the public

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,170
actually write that part that's Apollo

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,350
West the majority of the time quite a

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,320
lot of

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,910
Desktop is good majority time they do a

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,380
lot of stuff they're polish on the

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,970
desktop is good they're marketing you

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,100
today because like everything to it on

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,600
the website 76 or design and

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,640
presentation Elementary doesn't same

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,740
time they put a lot of effort into our

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,830
design and then they go or no way a lot

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,660
to have to get notice and then there's

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,000
also those who are Western lucky Lord

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,680
where certain traditions but they've

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,350
been doing a lot recently of big

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,590
marketing because there's an issue that

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:49,610
they recognize and fix which is KDE

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,890
connect was one of the best elements in

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:57,440
here at skelux but it doesn't work that

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:59,150
well because oh so you have tried other

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
things so when you go to Italy did you

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,090
go to touch ups did you get try this but

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,470
also you gotta try to sell the line is

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,790
like you're using the murkiness so you

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,250
get every decision is more complicated

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,560
so they simplify it by making Dornoch

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,660
nominees it rages orko use an app stores

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,880
needs a Bachelor in savings if they tell

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,440
their users just go that actually or a

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,970
noisy household and that makes it them

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,070
taunting you you know they're gonna

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,200
consult that is a great idea for what

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,820
process do you know you're gonna be

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,660
validating something that's just making

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,660
several or process

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:24,490
there's a lot of talk about interviews

00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:28,779
because it's that it's something for

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,220
celebrating us so it was a different

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,329
project since we're doing other way they

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,189
were contacting us and reading my

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:38,829
thousand times and we have a much more

00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:40,030
positive or provide reasons is contacted

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,490
by his projects that we

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,470
we didn't know existed until the comma

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,330
so that's like that's a great example

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,500
it's things I'm going to like them to

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,480
know also gloves like to give them I

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,890
know about you see they talk around and

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,870
the more people who talk about your

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,270
stuff your pockets right now the more

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,640
that is people learn it the more know do

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,010
40 kids who tried out one hand so that

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,200
is Friday biggest most important piece

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,390
or one of the things that they can

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,740
probably the biggest e a hurdle or

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,280
people who are doing the open source

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,690
projects is not knowing how to do the

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,700
marketing and now that there is a use

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,650
it's the design and the creative aspect

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,170
or hasn't paid words but there is an

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,550
atheist muscular also and he is a one

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,130
realms course with you can Burning Man

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:27,070
do that but you can also work justify

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,420
outsource that are not and a lot of

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,610
people who are in the community have a

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:36,010
lot of skills that are not necessarily

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:43,060
related development so if they ask for

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:45,040
collaboration is important has very very

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,660
violence to the project they shouldn't

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
be the focus there's a lot of people

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,010
usually uses for these do not only folk

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,720
they do because there's a lot of people

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,720
who do design marketing

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,129
there's key writing down proofreading

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,769
than you love your documentation there's

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:03,649
all kinds so you write down things

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:05,569
you're most usable for your projects and

00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,970
that's where the biggest issue that

00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:09,709
people even know some of it is not

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,899
taking advantage of a community though

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:14,179
even though the whole reason we're in

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,069
this of the community itself because so

00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:19,189
the source aspect is the ground source

00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,869
the community so such as my so marketing

00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:23,569
if you crowdsource that you'll find

00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:26,929
people such as myself are going to

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,609
gently throws their dignity who are the

00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,619
idea of helping a project like for

00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:39,319
example continued on the spectrum a

00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:41,179
promo videos for them until I felt a lot

00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,249
of different projects just doing their

00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:51,319
branding suggestions changing the name

00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:54,169
of certain purposes for example there's

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:54,709
a new endeavor less which is kind of

00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:58,850
awkward

00:13:54,709 --> 00:14:00,619
exactly and there's a lot of what

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,299
they're going to be doing this or the

00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:04,759
project can that I think is probably

00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:08,779
most like the other things and I think

00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:10,189
that's busted and the the thing is I

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,579
think of all those people feels that

00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:15,139
they're one to everybody change the old

00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,329
the whole goal was not very luxe

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,980
everybody's about history xlz waited you

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,079
have so much customers it's not really

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,449
what it was it was a difficult itself

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,569
that's how much customization wasn't so

00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:31,350
versity an extra suppose

00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:33,089
whatever truly a lot more whereas

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,709
endeavors your faces are going to be

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,509
their focus 9f test we're gonna give you

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,339
a lot more options now a lot easier I'll

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,959
do thanks but their focus on the its

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,819
Esparza spelled ROC culture Nami

00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,259
enjoyments all the extras ever and they

00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:45,259
talk now they give some things that

00:14:47,029 --> 00:15:05,879
they're doing or any other ones or their

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,170
deaf development building is called

00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,839
rookie there's like that's just what

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,250
he's doing to do that so you should make

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
that just another bet it's the name of

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,670
whatever you do inches be obvious I said

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,709
I'm gonna try to make it that's another

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,899
piece that you may carry collaboration

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,850
we don't try to make it on your project

00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,259
those name things has a terribly muscles

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,189
brain but everyone bring in like

00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:28,110
something project every time you do

00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:31,319
something clear every time we make like

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,139
a typo in a stall you want to be clear

00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,730
about what it is and know that nothing

00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,220
beyond that pretty says as soon as you

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,620
start making it

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,060
any causal logical order some illusion

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,740
you're gonna be easily doesn't creditor

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,529
I in seven sectors a lot of people are

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,390
just something if it doesn't mr. line

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,550
seven seconds and arranging is important

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,589
so you need to put some effort into is

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,230
contended with the branding is important

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,149
to promote the way you address discovery

00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,040
of what you're doing and how you promote

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,250
it too because that is so you should

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,380
remote you can't ask me what is that

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,029
he's the okay the fundamental one it

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,010
like I have a lot of chaos who has to be

00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,779
blessed or dislike that's okay the first

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,120
a number one question I'm asked as a

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,279
marketer what is the best so since it is

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,020
hat for always that I don't use in order

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,720
to communicate know everything and the

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,640
answer is always don't want here now

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,500
that is there everything there I'm gonna

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,470
use every single platform many days ago

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,300
now to be fair there are a lot of times

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,209
I think I've never really so you

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:41,160
probably said of those but even like new

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:42,660
trendy wins there are the things that

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:47,190
are you know for example is that there

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,899
any people here is heard about work so

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,110
there's there's plort there's a bunch of

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,579
okay that's better so there's there's

00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:03,810
there's a bunch of other ones are

00:16:53,579 --> 00:17:05,520
similar and I can totally understand why

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,290
that test against arm some tasks

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,270
there's a lot amazing tools that I will

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,189
get to instruction yes there's no way

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,530
around it there is the modulation tools

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,780
that I will get two seconds but and I

00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,640
still need to do it because is around to

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,069
a requirement oh that's good

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,309
unfortunately there just no around that

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,010
so let's go the next two nerds even

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,480
tools and motion tools so there's a lot

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,830
of style of marketing there's even

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,620
though the source marketing tools but

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,480
there's there's thousands of you know

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,700
services that you could use to make it

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,100
easier but those are all new stuff an

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,550
event is so next thing than people are

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,910
can't hear analytics is something I'm

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:58,350
glad people are not aware of how to tell

00:17:44,910 --> 00:18:01,110
me which so you know who you're marking

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,730
towards like what they want and what

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,559
traffic and there's no where the data

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,630
doing about how is your content don't

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,610
know exactly the direction people are

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,250
want you to take because a lot of times

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,020
I think that is the time that let's go

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:20,190
it's an unfortunate situation like

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:23,090
they're not the fact that if they like

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,090
something they're not going to

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,420
consideration that way we have to

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,700
address in some way it doesn't have best

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,410
way to do it especially leads to some

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,059
kind of data collection it doesn't have

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,720
to be so a couple can see a lot of likes

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:43,160
as an educational but also some will get

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,160
you a lot of options yourself

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:50,559
so there's volunteering not having this

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:59,590
data because when someone says it's

00:19:50,559 --> 00:20:02,740
impossible we use they downloads for us

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,440
those are excused because let's take an

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,450
example here you don't care doesn't

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,190
so my calendar Amir Amir doesn't you

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,950
Lestat's to the self-admitted project

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,320
without slightly greater noise perfect

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,590
value so without having this information

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,890
you're losing to that ton of value

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:25,070
female crack miss Lawrence - in what

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:27,200
aspect as far as the automation the

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,240
social media aspect of time fixing the

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,540
you can automate - it automated in there

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,980
certain things you can't automate your

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,200
degree there are certain things you

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,090
should not make like don't try to repo

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,450
so weak but there are a lot of these

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,740
edges here anyway so but there aren't

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,810
things you can do in our main with

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,370
beaver is my favorite of interest and

00:20:44,810 --> 00:21:00,710
Lana horse neighs your alternative

00:20:46,370 --> 00:21:05,060
enough so it allows you to create the

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:06,560
same kind of situation of anything so a

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,900
limit for example you post out of this

00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,670
one work logic running a variety of the

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,480
things so if for example you post a blog

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,250
on WordPress

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,230
that's automatically post a tweet using

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,780
the same thing or you have a video

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,790
that's always even you please do it even

00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,590
the same name for whatever platform you

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,430
want and there's even way something come

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:26,350
due any moment and a you know post

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,690
something on you too

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:31,210
it has a specific tag in the idiot

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,429
hashtag or England in the actual upload

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,009
once you kind of date if it has that tag

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,110
him also been or once you have

00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:40,630
visibility project if that video has

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,029
also been shared by someone else like

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,620
another project with your partner then

00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:46,960
share it based on so you can do like

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,139
multi they sell to multigon

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,360
sharing and it's also it's not like a

00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:52,740
social media to be done for all kinds of

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,419
things

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,730
it works with like REST API you can base

00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:01,980
it so the next one but it doesn't it

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,980
doesn't one other great tool and so

00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:17,159
probably the most unknown is fairly

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:19,450
large and that meiotic is Manik is a

00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,039
platform oh please respond he also have

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,960
like a you know hosted version where

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,820
it's premiums there like a fee which by

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:32,350
the way is my good tech is essentially

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:34,029
like open source MailChimp but much more

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,950
than this it does so to media platforms

00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:37,750
of just text messages as all kinds of so

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,279
there's in addition to the mail my

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,500
emails and marketing product is a

00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,019
straight so there's why don't you things

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,350
has nineteen Roenick easily Graces

00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:49,740
require a lot so it's a fantastic

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:53,590
Authority but it does require a lot of

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,360
issues with docker there was actually a

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,149
ravine handle donors with job melodic

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,850
and so there's there was actually review

00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:03,550
boards use eval Manik and and basically

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,650
down wonders they came up with

00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:09,590
and in kinda was sort of budget rapido

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,990
accustomed to using so that's basically

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,360
comes to an end of our talk as far as so

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,370
really fast that basically comes to an

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:22,190
end to the top half as far as I talked

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:25,940
really fast there do my pair you were

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:28,460
taught the day before we desire to use

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,260
trying to help so that's what happens

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,870
but you only get in touch with me

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:40,940
I have monster.com and at Monticello

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:46,660
pretty much everywhere podcasters have

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,660
been living a market and collectives of

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,910
you know their violation what you've

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,970
across there are you can handle bodies

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,860
we lar vard but you were if you've been

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,130
a marketing aspect if they're even where

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:10,520
the people are anywhere you do it so if

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,930
they're on Facebook that's now you can

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,240
do what I do and literally lose nothing

00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,520
every step of our sales and that's like

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,130
totally acceptable platform or you can

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,870
opponent marketing sense but being on

00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,610
every platform is it important to random

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,260
even those instagrams just post random

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,940
video

00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:50,380
lack of your knowledge I think your own

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:51,280
video hosted so fundamental don't ever

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:58,059
promote yourself

00:24:51,280 --> 00:25:00,070
he's never tell you what it is like they

00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,510
might have some random esoteric thing

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,980
that they're looking for they like so

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,740
many different ways he loves the most

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,080
part but you need to know and there's so

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,080
many different ways of doing like the

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,370
probably the best way would be to just

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,010
go when you started me a platform to

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,210
contact podcast content blogs and let me

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,640
know those are making sense of when I

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,549
see an art dancing master promoter and

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,980
and also in terms of like podcasting ask

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,530
how they do the interview so many

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,240
different variables and opportunities as

00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,100
we do that but if you don't ask them to

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,900
do it you're never gonna get there might

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,120
be some more just because well

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,890
statistically you never get to there

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:41,559
might be some random I think don't ask

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:44,730
and I think that be you ask you don't

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:48,010
ask you don't get and if you do ask

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,230
that's like the marketing comfortable

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,960
interesting thing so that's like

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,120
marketing is an interesting thing

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,370
because everyone can do it technically

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,940
speak willing but it takes people there

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,990
are 90 percent of the time willing to me

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,390
turned down

00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:06,390
be percent of the time if you don't

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:15,460
we're going to be shut down and just

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,410
another frustration forty multiple

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:24,460
sellers I will be doing the marketing

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:27,940
for two decades multiple years and I've

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,800
recognized I've heard no as a word

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,920
spoken to me I've had many times where

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,620
ever ever knows as a word spoken to me

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,000
in multiple languages constantly more so

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,000
than anything else I've ever heard

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,559
because if you constantly do sign of my

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
history they're never going to give

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,890
later because good in my era probably

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,100
every time there's something a lot of

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,200
good pretty much you probably know it

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,000
yourself a lot of times people will

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,860
always like contact you for just don't

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,570
like to know do some service for you or

00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,610
default it's always like a lawn mowers

00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,980
been taking care of the second ear Soho

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:07,179
and their default responses no you don't

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:09,309
even think about it you're just like but

00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:21,040
that's something that marketers deal

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:24,670
with every day is battling with yourself

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,650
and forcing yourself to continue by your

00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,970
content think they lose that said tip it

00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:34,270
so I think that the best tennety to is a

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,070
you are multiple veto no you don't ask

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,620
janvier

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,930
that's if you are comfortable they told

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,250
no because you're gonna the best thing

00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,130
to do is crowd stairs mama told me about

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,540
going to be doing it for you

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:47,160
participated there's a lot play about

00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,750
endings of people who won't ever as for

00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,510
example up participated with so many

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,550
communities and they never asked me to

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,310
do it I just chose Evan did it constant

00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:59,490
any work to actually ask for help even

00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,290
let you see the wallpaper they don't

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,540
mean and they don't think about why that

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,700
is such a popular things because they

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:10,050
don't they don't think about does it's

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,280
making a sport and wallpaper sisters the

00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,870
easiest one is there because they don't

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,610
have any opposition to it it's not big

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,430
deal with a couple do it literally you

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,740
know etc line but there's there's no

00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,470
reason not literally anything we wanna

00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,780
ask you something whether you ask or not

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,000
people don't either asking is that you

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,070
can being selfish or something maybe

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,940
there's one or two will want to do it

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:35,340
and I'm doing forget males each other

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,340
out because I all the mobile sources to

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,210
operate help each other around and that

00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,930
is to this particular talk and if you

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,970
have any questions I was open to Q&A now

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,590
alright first what does the mob to

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,870
actually do cuz they've been on their

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,840
website its keyword in it go it's just a

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,370
bunch of hand-wavy blah it's keyword

00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,930
bingo where you where it is and there's

00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:03,360
no idea connection yes

00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:05,890
in the Georgia is a starting platform

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,780
email text messaging social media

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,370
automation it's a really close variety

00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,890
different direct result analytics goes

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:14,110
into it so it's a regular the sense that

00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,390
you do is with a marketing campaign and

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,880
I can check to see like a be testable

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,590
American English class failing then you

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,170
could switch around and it does a lot of

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,150
like talk and plot points on things that

00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,430
they clicked in your email and all icon

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,790
for handlers to that so it's basically

00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,710
mail tuned like plus like SMS type of

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,750
marketing and social media like

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:41,530
HootSuite combined into one and adding

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:44,740
some curious can you think of an a open

00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,690
source project that checks all or both

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:50,350
of the boxes in terms of does good

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,560
marketing that is either not backed by a

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,120
large company or is babyback file

00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,150
sweating words and those independent

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:13,060
marketing long answer is the ones where

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:15,010
is known for long because they are doing

00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,500
- actually you're selling them they're

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:20,140
selling to Socrates value to it I think

00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,310
that's actually I think you're adding

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,130
value to it

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:27,340
like for the most people are people

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:29,890
where they don't ask for money for

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,790
anything other than exercise Cosmetics

00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,370
is like a loot crate's

00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,500
which are admittedly horrible they're

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:46,330
basically like great so like I give them

00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:48,100
extra fiends that's all because I think

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,600
that's the best approach because you

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,920
were you're still giving out the

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,290
software betray that your license and

00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,120
they also do the whole branding aspect

00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,470
with a rebrand things as I say

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,030
significant more convenient for the

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,980
Liberty to use it which is more people

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,960
using it there's actually a significant

00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,390
amount of people using so for instance

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,120
in ratio to passport connection ratios

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,890
or knives FL versus reason where people

00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,810
used and gentlemen money because it were

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,670
not that anything don't feel we're even

00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,170
them aware that it exists and then when

00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,610
they do find out exists they don't

00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,280
understand the difference of these today

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,600
skaters and you still replied but most

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,540
of the time the best part so there's

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,010
basically there's that source but most

00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,310
of the time the best marketing in terms

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:33,360
of open source is powered by some

00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,360
company's marketing team

00:31:38,570 --> 00:32:46,830
so it's some kind of they're doing like

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:48,480
a store Marcel was the last people in

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,920
easily expected to actually do it long

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,670
successful and making something so

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,740
they're using it

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,900
that was seemingly denying a little fun

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:59,210
and skill when you start using it

00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:02,220
that's very still where it started very

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,960
in demand they show you like a sequence

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,000
of where it started and how it was like

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,800
you know garbage a route that one

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,760
eventually got to work I'm a good

00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,720
example of something that is

00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,450
unfortunately a good example of

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,610
something that the community has had for

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,370
very long times and never took advantage

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,110
of a person not that important so

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,180
there's anything you think that is

00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:27,120
seemingly benign and not that important

00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:30,570
is totally benign markets because our

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,220
marketing a presentation it's a

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:36,120
fundamental process the best thing you

00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:40,860
can do and it's a fundamental piece to

00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,930
help reach any kind of you know outreach

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,810
workers or your audience because they're

00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,760
not going to you know spend more time

00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:50,850
and have you acting like normally on any

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,590
anymore then if you have to explain

00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,160
something so if you have a bring order

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:58,530
just your original thing you say if you

00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,930
have a brand new highway description and

00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,550
you say this is what it is if you have

00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:10,080
to be to select the words that you use

00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:13,370
to respond but at the same time punch

00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,370
that be accurate and clear

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:20,490
project ridiculously hard for a demand

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,290
curve modular something that my father

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,750
will work regardless you still want to

00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,030
know as simple and clear as pauses

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,780
there's many people who like myself talk

00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:35,290
about there's many things like that and

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:39,690
my it's any kind of project that

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:43,300
my feel that is worth making and their

00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:45,159
team it will knock sanity and there's

00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,750
also like a lot of high tech schools a

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,280
lot of times where I'll not take

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,720
advantage of those doesn't like I talked

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,919
about for crowdsourcing there's a lot of

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,929
times around talk to projects

00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,790
specifically those ones project felt you

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,110
did and I joined it a long time ago when

00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,440
I was destined to how many times about

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,370
Linux privately time and then I was

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,020
asked them how many times have you

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:09,700
donations and they're like are there

00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:11,860
five dollars here in there twice five

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,700
dollars that's a great man software why

00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,980
people are doing it

00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,390
why but have you asked them what is this

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,610
is a great piece of software why are you

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,890
doing it you don't ask for other masters

00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,450
I don't know HUD will drink it what

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,740
you're doing if you don't ask for it

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,210
they're having a donators don't know

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
that you need that knows you want to

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,270
know that you're doing it for again as

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,860
soon as I get better and young held more

00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:32,050
like they were marketing attention I do

00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,300
with my website and as soon as I used to

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:38,980
tell particular marketing I built a new

00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:40,480
episode of stuff and they get they went

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,370
from getting my thousand downloads a

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,770
week maybe a couple hundred downloads of

00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:49,090
my athletes to a minimum $5,000 a week

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:51,250
between targeting it's not five to talk

00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,910
to $20 a month things just under this is

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:57,520
not a lot $5.00 general but alien

00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,650
comparison tunes five to maybe ten

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,130
dollars and if you don't like ten years

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,390
that's a huge difference so if you don't

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,580
if you don't ask them they're not going

00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:08,580
to do it yes yeah

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:18,819
yeah how do you avoid I know you

00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:18,819
mentioned something about

00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:27,789
a small project on a project in a lot of

00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:30,789
cases who had a legal defense team

00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,789
somebody

00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:45,619
well it depends on well it depends on so

00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:49,430
really the biggest the biggest source of

00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:50,690
small projects or can't afford to get

00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:54,950
someone to help you can set it up for

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:56,329
you already have some region said that

00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,700
we're interesting projects that already

00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:02,150
have something built into it like for

00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,859
example WordPress is a great option for

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:07,160
that because they have built-in convey

00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:09,260
our stuff so if someone is doesn't want

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,790
you have any other data you just go into

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,530
the thing use the email that that you

00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:18,200
trade any time they made a comment or

00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:20,270
whatever you like that is a but the

00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,470
don't have you're not using tools that

00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,200
have builds and up you are features

00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:27,260
acting sometimes is intense that you can

00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,000
just disable the stuff I P so you can

00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,059
actually make it resistant to a cyber

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,609
thing but the idea in the system to

00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:37,069
someone can identify these things for

00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,839
like for the system to be able to

00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:41,450
compromise I mean a major presence in

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:46,010
life so if someone comes back is if you

00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:47,870
don't have some then

00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,480
it's got making a lot of information

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:52,970
like that my jumper has a lot worth in a

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,070
serial disabling carrying like I said I

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:58,250
smell has a really cool feature of

00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,480
disabling like I said the last two night

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,690
research so country but you can actually

00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,340
what it does is almost that last three

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,850
first set over eyepiece and what it does

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,920
then is it tasty exists the left I can

00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:13,490
stay on there for retract and then take

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:19,310
my new IP of the near poor original say

00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:21,140
that combines in total to you have so it

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,250
doesn't actually have information for

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,250
their first it does have a unique

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,430
anything if you turn your IP completely

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,310
off you happen it would that's kind of

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,530
the game deck system but if you haven't

00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:41,870
gone a little bit that's enough and so

00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:43,220
you can avoid that this is gonna do it's

00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,540
it's kind of its kind of like Google

00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,670
Analytics account there's a job to run

00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,950
away to get stolen it's just it's time

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,420
there's palatable analytics down in a

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,690
way to install it it's just a script

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,690
that you

00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:12,820
yes and no no the clients going to

00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:15,160
interact at that size the appliance so

00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,560
there are time to read and you can use

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,240
the API to taste stuff from outside and

00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,760
then pipe it through the API to come

00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,980
down that way automate scripts with it

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,869
and stuff like that but it's not it's

00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,869
pretty mostly a client site users day

00:39:36,160 --> 00:40:38,980
okay that's a good question okay and the

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:43,529
answer is again everywhere people just

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:47,030
turned off so much that I just covered

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:49,080
example if someone says I used to get on

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,910
way easier now after all these

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,350
transforms and I know people and there's

00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,240
that kind of thing thanks underlying

00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,600
you're on these platforms and I don't

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,250
think some people are like refers to you

00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,870
that means people already but if company

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,040
makes me they purchase it because people

00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:06,150
already to give them and that means

00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:08,190
people already so if a source a variety

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,080
so even if you don't use it you're

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,880
making source have on a fact to install

00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,950
your source and zuly versions you

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:18,780
shouldn't believe have an account there

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:20,370
so that people around some sponsor

00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,930
crowdsource and not going to where

00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,240
people are there was one time putting

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:26,340
only serves on the echo chamber like

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,050
suppose there was one on Jake almost

00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,940
specifically named collage I'm never

00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,220
going to live they were looking for

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,750
marketing people things to help them and

00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,490
ever going to higher than advance what

00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,010
happens to little Parker the foundation

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,290
of resumes and then they chose they put

00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,910
out a call for marketers to give resumes

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:47,010
and that shows a few books I don't know

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:49,710
I was not whether the oysters I didn't

00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:58,640
know that I know your Labor's market

00:41:49,710 --> 00:42:00,900
reason I didn't knows because yeah our

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,390
colleagues dismissive it's in their

00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,040
resumes are you doing alarm wailing list

00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,710
before I know just discuss it before

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,060
this particular type of thing what so

00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,279
people have to know that you've had that

00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,769
interpersonal important even though

00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:18,029
even just worst thing that you can

00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:19,349
possibly do is if you even just and

00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:21,599
that's it then you do nothing else

00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,849
except elsewhere that's a thousand times

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,159
better than posting on some random

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:28,159
esoteric mailing list so anything else

00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:41,339
Oh so the cursory analytics I mean I've

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,910
got somebody who's particularly privacy

00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:45,869
conscious but I still every time I

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:49,530
install software

00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:50,490
I see a would like some aesthetic man so

00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,790
here's what we're gonna collect

00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:55,559
I still don't check the box sure yes my

00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:58,170
question is that is there anything that

00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,520
you could do you know marketing like

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:04,530
just going hey like here's why we

00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,569
actually beat this a lot of times read a

00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,180
good fight okay watch thing about like

00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:10,740
that is market is most absolutely about

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,349
presentation so the best thing about it

00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:32,849
is marketing is absolutely understand

00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:38,490
about presentation there's villainy

00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:40,260
Megamind is back for and Supergirl is

00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,480
like like they're arguing back and forth

00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,099
and Megaman says something about how

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,619
Prince you know the difference between

00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:49,020
you and me because why anything it's

00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,900
like super elaborate and that is the

00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:54,270
most important thing super elaborate

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,859
alike and that is the most important day

00:43:54,270 --> 00:44:00,230
because you can be the villain people

00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:00,230
still like they'd like to carry just

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,460
electric

00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,290
you have some kind of vibrant attached

00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:11,570
to those aligning that if you take

00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,280
attack offense in Firefox you go to see

00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,720
everything is called art boss he loaded

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,270
the first time and asked you what he has

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,580
to say today they're lifting each other

00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:21,380
what's this air but asked you buying

00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,560
there's some art you're taking as I

00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,510
choose what to share there's some

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,660
arguments of lexically said anyway you

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,580
know don't you even know how let's say

00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,500
for example you want to meet someone a

00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:37,760
and how you want anyone for lunch as

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:40,849
long as we don't say hey I don't like to

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,070
rely Karl and you know talking about you

00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:44,720
say would you like to meet tomorrow or

00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,060
toxins are still here something like

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,920
that so we've given a community options

00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,240
but both oxygens makes you lives here

00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,560
you could argue that's what so in the

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,390
same thing a presentation you'll make

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,530
when you say choose what to share you

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,720
can argue that's what they're doing here

00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:58,280
but they're still making a complicated

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,320
unfortunate and people don't know what's

00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,400
open sharing even analytics here so in

00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,440
this kind of sensitive entering

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,660
analytics you're upfront about it and

00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,310
you do it in a simple approach that is

00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,290
the best it's the best thing I that was

00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,099
a test

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:15,390
any other questions yep

00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:18,540
Oh

00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,540
[Music]

00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,310
and now we find ourselves a problem of

00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,480
having a super fragmentation where

00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:42,960
people are trying to get information

00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,960
from and today or

00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:02,700
there's multiple factors for that

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:12,790
question right now so the first question

00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:15,130
so the first is having not having if you

00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,600
have anything my dad the content it's

00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,850
not like a specific community core

00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,560
language is just easy he needed contact

00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,000
whatever controls a transfer control are

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,250
going to assume it's because it means

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,720
that you need to have it as a main brand

00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,550
because you are going to the student to

00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,440
maintain any still going to so even if

00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,150
you statistically say unofficial

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,600
something so for example it's just going

00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:36,610
to go to that because especially so for

00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:41,140
example austell list doesn't have to

00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:44,680
elevate but there is a he will still go

00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,750
to it and even if there's any person

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:52,480
who's as far as that projects who wants

00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:53,410
to help in that group so that that is a

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,240
negative thing that you will take

00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,940
control and the people step control just

00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,530
if you have a platform any kind of like

00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,630
that isn't the same sentence which is

00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,340
where if you have a class forming any

00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,110
kind of so there's north isomer make so

00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,180
miles has control over these get as soon

00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,660
as back to me but as far as information

00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:13,540
goes there's and what I mean by program

00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,920
to be proactive for my most important

00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,330
thing and what I think about proactive

00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,650
it I mean you provide information

00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:22,720
something wrong it's not so if you have

00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,579
something that you're working on

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,720
and it's not such a good practice that

00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:28,390
kind of worried about these getting out

00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,560
there just cleared out just go on

00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,730
Twitter and say and I'm working on this

00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:37,950
through the screen without or something

00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:37,950
you know there's a good example right

00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:47,440
there working well while we're on that

00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,690
till the news release nobody's around it

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,089
but in that process seminary but if you

00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,440
look at recently for the past ability

00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:58,480
few months or so men even gear they

00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,300
ability right hand got the thing going

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,190
on blogged everything out by the ramp he

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,900
doesn't like what has been going on the

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:09,010
dynamics whether he's doing it someone

00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:11,109
else is doing it gives in and makes it

00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,819
so much easier works to share the proper

00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,349
information because they're not so here

00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:15,849
it seems is in situation how arbitrary

00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,760
change any mother suppose there's really

00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:20,410
no guarantee so it's a situation that a

00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,490
person doesn't sense there's really no

00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,250
guarantee a

00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:26,920
but it's no president's approach it to

00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,230
them trying to get have official

00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,910
president on everything you can about

00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:37,720
that's the first get up and they also

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:39,130
provided and also another thing is some

00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,900
people maybe people share is your how

00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,640
many people are like for example are the

00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,250
project makes for some things will be

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,410
more subjective for example you have a

00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:49,240
forum every feature is known as people

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,859
are promote moderator considered cards

00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,569
attend that will make the don't hide the

00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:53,319
backward contributing one promoting

00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:55,420
Alfred

00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:57,640
and without making one contribute more

00:48:55,420 --> 00:49:00,279
and one could compare about what they're

00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:02,140
saying is most helpful to that so if you

00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:04,089
give them an attention and credit for

00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,559
the work that your opportunity care does

00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:07,239
not wait to avoid therefore is

00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:10,420
information figuring out sale they use

00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:14,349
will care more about it and therefore if

00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:16,690
you are not available they will go to

00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,549
those different masses in particular and

00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,619
once you give them likely to see

00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:22,719
sometimes recognition don't ever care

00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:24,759
more to make Pennsylvanians if they do

00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,039
seem it around doesn't help to fix it

00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:28,690
too but so that's the best thing is to

00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,839
kind of crowd source that aspect too

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,999
especially if you're really no silver

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,489
bullet to fix it especially if you

00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:38,739
already have some convolution but if

00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:40,089
there's anything unfortunate like extras

00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:41,829
communities that are building around it

00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:45,369
but if there's anything loose to take

00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:48,059
over out to do so as soon as possible is

00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:48,059
there any other questions

00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:21,430
put it on even like I've tested on

00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:23,170
ridiculously low cost hosting and $2.00

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:26,890
a week sounds not far let's go to

00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:28,780
website and it would go perfectly fine

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,810
they lost but website and you have two

00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,490
other sites as well so those were not

00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,410
they were just testing traffic they're

00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,450
not so much as it was most of the time

00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,040
ago everybody we're inclined to put it

00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,610
on digital ocean chocolate or something

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,760
like that

00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:46,590
you're now having any issue whatsoever

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,590
yeah a question yes

00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,180
there's a general compliance that that's

00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:57,470
accepted incorrectly among the people

00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:58,730
marketing to work here would be already

00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:03,340
accepting of the free and open source

00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:05,960
mindset would there be any

00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:10,010
recommendations you would give for using

00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,750
that as a selling if they have an

00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:14,270
embrace to kind of embrace because they

00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:16,010
have to understand well okay they have

00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,300
any breaks or no you want to portes

00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,390
don't have to understand it first and

00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,550
most importantly we're going to market

00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,530
something that joins their first you

00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:26,240
know as a consumable life person you're

00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:28,240
trying to get the audience's problem so

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,560
if they're personally doesn't know are

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,570
you actually an open source market you

00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,970
know participating in collective effort

00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,950
but if you might open source marketing

00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,720
specifically to explain their limits

00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,980
but if you were to market as like the

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,930
source of your goal is not to get people

00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:43,550
already aware my source what the exists

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,750
is going to add an extra barrier to for

00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,790
that understand what's going something

00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,830
that's my with example II when those

00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,420
terminal thing watching today was

00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,950
something that one of the things we'll

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,630
have to know I do it is even watching

00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,510
that video they have no idea what it is

00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,700
but they're interested in what it is

00:51:55,510 --> 00:52:03,560
look how they can use it now season even

00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:05,210
if it is just an everyday source if the

00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,070
percentage over in that sense I would

00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:09,820
say that don't try to go for the over

00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:11,770
these are where the first

00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,830
one of the big hand work if they are

00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:16,810
aware it is definitely one of the big

00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:19,240
concepts marketing in this community is

00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,620
diversity but if when I go for an

00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,410
audience that's just anyone we're

00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,450
creating I would say take it is with

00:52:23,410 --> 00:53:06,340
regard to mopping your marking campaigns

00:52:25,450 --> 00:53:11,650
is the most useful to everybody even if

00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:14,080
that means that you the next step is the

00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:16,360
next step I was first I should do and

00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,340
also try to create a place poisoning to

00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,020
do allowable to find you well how can

00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,640
also promote people to come to you well

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,320
the worst thing to do is when asking the

00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:30,550
boys well how can we climb to the

00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:31,180
website well you just well it's like

00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,000
blogger

00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:36,910
dotnet or so need to get a better deal

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,830
ingrown way if you need to tell you

00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:42,030
about my own get a better domain by the

00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:42,030
way if you do if you have a dot

00:53:48,680 --> 00:54:23,460
if you have anything else if you don't

00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,920
have a good going today don't

00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,080
necessarily have the best really

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,730
necessary but if you only ever talk to

00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,890
the less people know any other websites

00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,030
that you could ever again you've gone to

00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:35,600
have you ever gone to the Debbie's

00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,600
website go

00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,560
like if we go to certain websites it is

00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,540
impressively that's what they put in is

00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:49,380
like an even like a migrant herded by

00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,850
the Intel it's like I've heard

00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,970
that one we make sure it's kind of every

00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:57,030
player market so these particular the

00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:58,260
homeland sites that work for them are at

00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:03,630
least put some effort in because there's

00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:05,340
a ton of websites needed a lot of are

00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,260
not doing much after the time don't know

00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,490
why but you need to change it as soon as

00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,960
possible

00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,070
pretty much happy to talking if you have

00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,600
one of those I think it's just way over

00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,490
to hallway that's do it immediately

00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,900
because we did even if you just go to

00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:19,910
work rescue the template throw it up

00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,910
there that's better that can say my talk

00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:38,300
I was super prepared

00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:58,850
of course

00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:14,420
[Music]

00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:17,529
oscillations

00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:35,220
grandpa I'm gonna be mad

00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,670
I people are expecting me to be super

00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:44,330
tired

00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:45,780
maybe I'll email because it's been about

00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:50,270
a year

00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,270
except they move and I start already

00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,610
important I think it's hard to do a

00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:19,510
changing industry always we have there's

00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:21,550
like 30 percent of what we know and

00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,530
everything else is just like that so

00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:27,010
that's my pepper daddy's want to do this

00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:28,600
one piece shows want to stop he says

00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,640
might've actually would get market I

00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,000
said I figured that way we learn about

00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,970
and know there's no way I could actually

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,610
pick some lame how it all works except

00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:42,220
for it's a daunting task just give up or

00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:43,630
less like basically have that need if

00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,860
you ever want to become a marketer you

00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:50,800
just deal with local laws a lot of

00:57:47,860 --> 00:58:01,860
documentation reading a lot of effort

00:57:50,800 --> 00:58:01,860
never see me

00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:18,609
Universal projects is to use my

00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:29,920
marketing export my heart is full

00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:29,920
because that's how I said from

00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,530
[Music]

00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:05,840
anyone bring out I said could be

00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:09,640
selection on Photoshop and every we

00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,640
actually have one person budget go oh

00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:17,650
there's something very often escalate

00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,650
