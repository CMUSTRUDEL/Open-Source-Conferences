	00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:27,619
good morning my name is Nolan Alaia I if

00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,529
you haven't if you don't recognize this

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:32,660
out of my voice I host a weekly talk

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,180
radio show called the ass Noah show and

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,170
I'm the owner of ultimate technologies

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,820
and we're a contract IT MSP and so

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,739
essentially what that means if you're

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,809
not familiar with the term is that there

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:49,280
are places like small hospitals or small

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:51,229
law offices that employ us to manage

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,699
their IT infrastructure because it's

00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,170
more cost effective to do that on a

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:59,119
contract rate than it is to have

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,860
full-time IT staff in 2009 the reason

00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,010
that we started all tospeed technologies

00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:07,460
was because we experienced with other

00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,950
companies that if you utilized

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,259
open-source you could provide a creative

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,970
cost-saving solution to the customer

00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:16,939
without sacrificing inequality and

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,979
that's not when I say that it's not a

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,780
line it's not a brochure filler it's not

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,399
something that we we just stick up on

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,520
the website because we needed to replace

00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,859
Laura ipsum right that's a actual core

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,140
belief that we really believe that if

00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:32,060
you utilize open source technology that

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,619
there there are creative ways to solve

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,960
the exact same problems that people

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,270
solve with proprietary solutions but we

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,770
can do that at a cost savings with

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,539
higher quality of code more security

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,200
more stability all of the reasons that

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:47,350
you're probably here at Linux Fest now I

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,689
want to be clear what this talk isn't

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:54,469
this isn't the kind of talk where we

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:57,170
tell you here are the you know the here

00:01:54,469 --> 00:02:01,280
here are some ideas of how you can go

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,950
about selling your self in an open

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,299
source world or how can you go about

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,159
selling yourself or anything like that

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,120
it's not it's not a sales lesson really

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,160
what it is is a collection of

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,140
hard-earned life lessons going through

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,209
this myself because one of the issues

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,069
you face and it's important to remember

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,990
any time you're pitching any product or

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,090
service free and open source or

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,530
otherwise people tend to don't value

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,650
something that doesn't have a price tag

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:31,320
on it and so when you tell people that

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,840
you have a alternative to their

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,180
$5,000 Cisco Network appliance and you

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,920
tell them that this free alternative

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,420
will provide the same VoIP calling

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,780
functionality in fact actually more

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,220
avoid calling functionality as their

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,810
$5,000 Cisco system and then on top of

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,310
that you tell them that there is no

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,940
yearly maintenance fee there is no

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,260
subscription free when they ask where is

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,430
that software and how do I get it and

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,150
you tell them I downloaded it off the

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,970
internet

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,860
it tends to have kind of a weird feel to

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,360
it right I went on the internet I found

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,380
this thing and I downloaded it and I

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,650
want to put it into your production

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,210
system so it's important if you are

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,860
going if you're considering going into

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,440
open source or if you're in open source

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,330
and you're trying to work in a business

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,060
environment that you're paying attention

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,120
to the fact that people put a value

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,030
right or wrong based on on on the price

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,210
tag you put it on so what did we do what

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,350
we did was we arbitrarily assigned value

00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,670
to given projects charge the client take

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,920
that money and donate it right back to

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,920
the developer now the interesting thing

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,970
is I times I will say that in a room and

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,350
I'm guessing it's because it's 9:00 in

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,870
the morning and most of us would rather

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,240
be in bed right now but sometimes I will

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,590
say that and people laugh at it like

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,600
it's kind of funny like oh that's that's

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,670
amusing and clever right the reality is

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,730
I'm following the exact same developer

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,170
workflow that you that a developer would

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,150
expect to be followed and expect to be

00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,240
paid if he or she worked on a project

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,459
instead of out of passion but to collect

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,930
a paycheck and I think sometimes as

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,180
stewards of the open-source community we

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,860
forget there are real people attached to

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,420
those projects and they have lives and

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,030
bills to pay and food to put on their

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,200
table and just because you were able to

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,540
go out to the internet and download

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,370
something at no cost to you doesn't mean

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,100
that it didn't come at a cost to

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,260
somebody else and so often times when I

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,270
say things when I open it when I open a

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,860
presentation with we provide these

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,260
things at a cost saving to the client

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,000
people go they think to themselves oh

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,280
yeah because open-source money or open

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,600
source software doesn't cost money and I

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,250
want to be clear that's not the case it

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,530
absolutely cost money it's just most

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,150
time being donated to you by the good

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,050
graces of the developer are the people

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,940
that work on it because they're

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,500
passionate about it and if we want to

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,210
keep them passionate and keep them

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,710
involved and keep them developing the

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,470
software then we need to

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,419
give them money for what they do and

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,550
it's important no matter what side of

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,320
that equation you're on whether you're

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,810
on the side of you're trying to charge

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,669
people for money or charge money for the

00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,979
thing that you're doing or if you're

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:02,320
trying to give money back to a project

00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:05,620
the first thing we all have to agree on

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,240
is that making money is an okay thing to

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,680
do

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
charging people money for something in

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,330
exchange for a good product or service

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,940
is perfectly acceptable there's nothing

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,740
wrong with it it's not immoral it's not

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,389
something to be ashamed of it's not

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,080
something to be scared of it's something

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,330
to embrace and so often I will come

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,590
across business owners and I will have a

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,660
conversation with them and they'll say I

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,789
can't figure out my problem is I have an

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,590
issue and I seem to hit this hurdle or

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,930
I've hit a plateau and I don't know how

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,130
to grow my business and what you find is

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,960
when you're just sitting down talking to

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,729
these people what you find is they're

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,020
embarrassed they're embarrassed of their

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,960
own business they're embarrassed because

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,610
they don't believe that they they

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,139
command the amount of money that they

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,639
charge or that they should be charging

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,650
because they didn't maybe pay for the

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,650
software that they're installing good

00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,310
yeah yeah in fact to your point it's a

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,639
great question to your point

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,590
say again the the question was was

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,219
simply this is does artificially

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,389
imposing a cost on a product or service

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:19,699
increase its perceived value in the apps

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,199
the answer to that is absolutely yes and

00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,289
a perfect example of what you're talking

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,099
about is we a word that we were

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,139
developing

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:30,680
I shouldn't say developing but we were

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:34,250
finding ways to creatively utilize Linux

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,069
I chose to install on guest Kia kiosk

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,050
machines that we put inside of

00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,639
hospitality places venues and so we

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,379
would put these computers in and instead

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,419
of charging them and a thousand bucks

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,189
for a Windows machine with site kiosk

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,270
and all the licensing in deep freeze and

00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,979
all the other crap you got to put on it

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,159
to make sure that that Windows doesn't

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,740
choke to death what we found was when we

00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,419
pitched the three alternative people

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,189
were immediately set to go as soon as we

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:00,729
added a two hundred dollar price tag or

00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,620
$300 price tag now people thought oh

00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:05,629
they found us a deal we were spending

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,430
$700 before now we're getting it for

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,639
three or four hundred that's a deal and

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,310
to the small Linux distribution that we

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,990
we used to base that software off of

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,969
those guys were thrilled because now

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,199
there's money and funding they're

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,819
developed with some of their development

00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,379
costs and stuff like that and picking up

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,199
some of their hosting and as thank you

00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,960
for the fact that we are now able to use

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,909
their their product to to to make

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,529
something appear more valuable to the

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,539
customer does that adequately answer

00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:35,360
your question and if anybody else has

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,680
questions feel free to fling them at me

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,020
as we go on don't need to wait for the

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,669
end so when if you believe in what

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,250
you're doing and you believe something

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:48,589
is moral and right and okay to make

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:53,060
money you stand a better chance of

00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:54,439
success the P you can always tell

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,270
somebody who is proud of the work

00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,770
they're doing and this is a great place

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,110
to make this example right because

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,509
everybody here if you're at this

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,460
conference chances are the vast majority

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,490
of you are passionate about something

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,620
some product and whatever that project

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,270
is as you bump into people in the hall

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,160
you almost wear it like a badge of honor

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,410
and you'll say I work for

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,670
work with or I develop with or I am part

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,930
of and it becomes a part of your

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,050
identity because you're so enthusiastic

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,790
about that product or that service and

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,820
whether you know it or not it makes you

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:30,450
a good salesperson what makes a poor

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,250
salesperson is the what we call the

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,690
shame reflex or when somebody is

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,510
embarrassed or or or or feel shame for

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,890
the product or service and this is why

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,850
the most successful business people

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,920
believe in the product or service that

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,060
they sell and the ones that don't don't

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,210
make it very far at all

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,850
uh Ulta speed technologies we carry a

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,720
large range of hardware products and

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,550
software that we install and support and

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,840
every one of those pieces of software

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,190
every one of those pieces of hardware

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,540
are in sitting inside of my house even

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,540
when they're not practical to sit inside

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,850
of my house we have a an access control

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,410
system and I've told the story on my

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,780
talk radio show a couple of times of my

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,240
wife getting locked out with our

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,280
proximity ID door system access control

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,200
system and that system does not belong

00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,970
in a residential house but the reason

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,220
it's there is because before I was

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,260
willing to put our name on it and before

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,580
I was willing to tell customers that

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,400
they should spend thousands of dollars

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,490
to have us come out and install this I

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,260
wanted to see how it worked for myself

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,720
developers and what this is why I'm so

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,860
passionate about Linux on the desktop

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,870
developers fix problems when they come

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,880
into a niche when they come into

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,190
something that bothers them and you can

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,690
take that same principle and apply it to

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,790
your own business and in our case I take

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,350
hardware and and try it out and that

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,020
there's there another point in there too

00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,030
and that is this even if you work for

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,480
someone else people that are successful

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:06,210
take ownership of their own job and so

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,010
when you talk to people one of the

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,570
things that you will hear and I hear it

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,420
all the time and I say what do you do

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,430
and they say I work for X that doesn't

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,810
tell me what you do that tells me who

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,700
you work for and if the most interesting

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,140
thing about you is that you work for

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,770
somebody else so frankly I'd rather talk

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,140
to them when somebody asks what you do

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,520
take ownership of that chart of that job

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,580
and it doesn't matter if you own the

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,010
company or not

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,890
take ownership of that job I'm a

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,290
software developer who writes code I am

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,880
a person who helps businesses connect

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,560
with their solutions for whatever the

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,370
whatever the answer is define what you

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,709
do and talk about that be an advocate

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,029
and go out and advocate for yourself and

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,990
if you own a business then you advocate

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:53,290
a course for your your business when you

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,470
go out to talk to a clients excuse me

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,870
when you go out and talk to clients they

00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,980
can smell desperation and that was one

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,959
of the things I learned the hard way

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,120
early on it wasn't because I was

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,620
embarrassed of the products or service

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,990
we were selling I was confident in their

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,510
quality I was just nervous and knew and

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,800
didn't really know what I was doing and

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,300
couldn't figure out why I couldn't make

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,220
sales and part of that is well because I

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,529
not a sales person I don't have a sales

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,480
background but when you're a small

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,279
business owner you start out as the

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,230
receptionist the janitor the sales

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,420
person the service technician the phone

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,399
technician the IT repair guy the plumber

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,050
and you know until you're doing one of

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,240
those hey thanks for calling we'll get a

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,339
technician right out I have to go right

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,829
out you know now I'm gonna send the bill

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,079
you know you're doing it all yourself

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:41,589
and when and I couldn't figure it out

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,209
later on what I've learned is when I was

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,390
confident and I was comfortable and I

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,070
was okay with not making a sale I didn't

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,810
need to make the sale all of a sudden

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,959
it's much easier to make sales why is

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,480
that desperation smells people can tell

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,160
when you're desperate to try to get them

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,440
to spend money and that makes them

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,260
nervous as it's good because your

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,880
motivation is split right starvation is

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,550
a powerful motivator and if they can

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,399
tell that you're in trouble if you don't

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,199
make that sale there is the the

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,329
preconception probably somewhat accurate

00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:15,160
that you're going to try to push that

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:17,050
sale rather or knots in the clients best

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,790
interest and so what we have is a

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:25,240
breakdown of trust and Trust is oops I

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,010
got out of order where preparation meets

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,250
opportunity now this is sometimes a

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,570
quote associated with Zig Ziglar there's

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,160
actually somebody that said it before

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,690
him and then Zig Ziglar changed it to

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,720
success is where preparation meets

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,110
opportunity I was in a sandwich shop and

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,630
I

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,860
I was going through it I was unhappy to

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,970
be in this particular sandwich shop

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,709
because I don't like anything they have

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,570
but it was my father-in-law's birthday

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,850
and he asked if we could go to the

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,310
sandwich shop and when the thing about

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,589
me is I am I'm generally pretty

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,870
easygoing until I get pushed into

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,880
something that I vocalized multiple

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,430
times that I really don't want to do and

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,329
then I become kind of a jerk so I'm in

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,930
there and I'm like I don't want anything

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,450
I'm not hungry

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,850
and I'm standing in line and this guy

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,440
who's a very nice seventeen eighteen

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,640
year old kid goes good afternoon

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
sir what can I get you I don't want

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,430
anything everything you have sucks

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,560
anything goes I think we have some good

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,000
food good for you you eat it I'm not

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,500
hungry

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,930
because well how about this no how about

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,430
this no and I can't figure out why this

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,810
idiot won't leave me alone I don't want

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,070
a stupid sandwich I just want to be left

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,480
alone I want to sulk and I want to make

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,630
an idiot out of myself inside of this

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,510
just leave me alone right so I'm

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,740
standing here being a being a jerk right

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,279
because I just want to be left alone and

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,709
the kid tells me all right here's the

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,570
sandwich you need and he starts selling

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,949
me on the sandwich right it has this

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,449
kind of meat and it has that kind of

00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:51,040
cheese in it it's made with this kind of

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:52,360
bread and it's so great night I take

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
these thing home I buy two of them I

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,560
take one home and when I round thinking

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,390
yes he's describing him I God doesn't

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,040
sound as bad as I don't start thinking

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,390
I'm finally I'm like you know what he's

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,350
been talking about this for five minutes

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,240
I guess I have to figure out what the

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,500
stupid thing is about and see if it's

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,390
actually worth I saw I buy the stupid

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,949
sandwich as he's ringing me up I look up

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,899
and realized that is the most expensive

00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,850
sandwich on the entire menu in a

00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:17,680
restaurant I didn't want to eat at in

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,350
the first place so he finishes checking

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,480
me out and I looked up at him I said

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,680
what's your plans in this in this in

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,930
this tiny little sandwich shop he goes

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,079
well I'm considering doing door to door

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,250
vacuum cleaner sales and I went well

00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:31,750
that makes sense you're a good

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,160
salesperson I said tell you what I gave

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,160
him my card and I said call me

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,870
I said let's let's III know you got a

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,890
vacuum cleaner a budding vacuum cleaner

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,420
you know entrepreneurship coming up but

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,190
I want to make you a better deal come

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,630
chat with me coming to my office I'm the

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,290
best sales guys we've ever had right and

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:52,480
the reason he got that job was because

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,329
he was going to be the best damn

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,959
sandwich salesman

00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:59,610
could buy for 895 you know because that

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,410
was his bitching if he's gonna do it he

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,449
was gonna do it well and the point there

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,519
is this there are so many people and I

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,889
meet them and they tell me no I just

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,199
need I just need the right opportunity

00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:12,389
and then then I'm going to I'm gonna I

00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,189
put all my effort in but right now I'm

00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:16,350
so beat down by my job and I just have

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,139
no passion and no motivation and guess

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,209
what we don't hire people that don't

00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,709
have passion and motivation if you come

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,989
into my office and you're like I'm burnt

00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,439
out I don't want you working for me

00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:29,639
because it's much easier to redirect

00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,499
somebody who already has energy and

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,499
passion than it is to try to kick a

00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:38,189
donkey and get him to move right

00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:40,799
this kid was was doing his best at the

00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:42,929
store and he had a natural sales skill

00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,579
that apparently nobody else in that

00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:47,910
restaurant had noticed before I walked

00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,769
in thank God for me but the but as we

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,379
walked in there and I saw what he was

00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,239
doing I couldn't help but make him an

00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,319
offer and he I promise he's made a lot

00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:59,759
more money he's making at the sandwich

00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:03,480
place right so all of this comes down to

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,639
trust and trust is the same reason why

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,309
that kid got me to buy that sandwich

00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,369
because he he showed himself to be an

00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,919
authority on that sandwich and so if he

00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:15,919
believed in that sandwich and he trusted

00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,269
that that was a good sandwich to eat

00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,919
that couldn't help but spread to me and

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,869
I was willing to spend money that I was

00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,119
absolutely dead set against spending

00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:26,009
when I walked in because I trusted this

00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,509
kid right ended up being a great

00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:29,279
sandwich I haven't gone back to the

00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,189
sandwich stuff since but if I did I know

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,410
what sandwich I would get trust can't be

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:36,269
purchased and this is what is so

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,629
frustrating to people that want to do a

00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:41,970
business out of La out of a desire for

00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:44,129
money instead of a passion and again I

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,379
want to read her very first slide right

00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,329
making money is not immoral I don't

00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,399
believe that I think making money is a

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:53,879
perfectly moral correct right thing to

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,160
do that said if you're motivated by the

00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,439
wrong things it tends to blow up in your

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,610
face and so I get people all the time

00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:01,259
they say I want to take out a fifty

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,119
thousand dollar business loan and I want

00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,230
to buy big signs and I want to buy big

00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,820
shirts and I want to buy this know and

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,150
buy that

00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,640
you've spent three years for a company

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,200
that has never made you a dime why do

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,580
you want to do that well because it

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,900
would be professional and it will brand

00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,980
me and really what they're saying they

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,110
don't know it but really what they're

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,500
saying is I want to purchase trust I

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,460
want to spend fifty thousand dollars

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,080
jump-starting my business because I

00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,030
believe it's going to purchase me trust

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,370
and Trust will lead to sales what I'm

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,960
here to tell you is trust can't be

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,520
bought you cannot purchase it there's no

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,470
amount of money that you can spend on it

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,570
and part we have part of that to thank

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,480
to all of your phones that go off all

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,610
the time with these stupid spam Robo

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,500
callers right there was a time where if

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,360
you got a call and the caller ID match

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,770
the your bank and you got a call and

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,780
they had a professional voice and they

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,000
you know you would start to think okay

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,230
maybe this is actually my bank now us in

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,760
this room there's a lot of us our

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,410
security people probably just hung up on

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,030
the poor person and then called our bank

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,510
back and then the same person answers

00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:02,870
you're like oh sorry but but at its

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:04,790
heart it's a trust issue and what what

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,970
happens when you earn a client's trust

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,920
you get decision power one of the things

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,260
that I have learned to do is fire

00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,270
clients before we ever hire them and so

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,280
when you sit down with a client a lot of

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,200
people look at their business as I just

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,760
need clients because that's how I make

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,880
money and that's how the world goes

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,770
around and the truth of the matter is be

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,350
selective of the clients that you take

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,010
on because you want it to be a two-way

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,570
fit and if you can make it a two-way fit

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,250
you stand to make more money you stand

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,690
to be happier in what you're doing and

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,160
you're more effective the the last I

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,720
used to tell people when we started when

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,780
we hit we were approaching our ten-year

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,310
anniversary and for 10 years or at least

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,260
eight of them I would always tell people

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,270
I was so proud of the fact that since

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,100
2009 all tospeed has never lost a client

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,810
since the day we went into business if

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,610
we walked into a business and we took

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,200
over their IT infrastructure they never

00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,820
let us go and I was so proud of that I

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,560
thought that was the coolest statistic

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,420
ever when they came in we could treat

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,760
them so well and give him a better deal

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,280
and make things work so well that they

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,710
they would never part with us and what I

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,630
realized after five six seven years of

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,770
doing it I'm not exactly sure when when

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,660
this change happened it was kind of a

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,530
gradual thing at some point I was like

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,070
but

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,960
we have clients that we we end up doing

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,230
things that we are not meant to do as a

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,000
company because and the whole reason is

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,340
just to Rick just to retain that stupid

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,960
statistic and it's an it is a stupid

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,620
statistic and it's an idiotic metric of

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,720
success your your don't worry about

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,580
keeping every client you've ever had

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,410
don't worry about taking every client

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,270
that walks through your door take the

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,340
ones that you can provide the most value

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,810
to because in the end that's what's

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,280
gonna give them the highest return on

00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,260
their investment and that's what gives

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,570
you the highest return on the work

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,980
you're doing when we sit down with

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,690
clients one of the questions I ask them

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,880
is what are you looking for in an IT

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,950
service provider and if they say well

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,240
here's our checklist of the machines

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,500
that we have and here's the motto you

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,670
buy and here's the software you install

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,810
and here's the date that you install it

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,890
and here's when you do updates and

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,660
here's when you take it down and here's

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,190
when you do backups and I say you know

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,110
what you sounds like you got it handled

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,870
hire a hire an IT guy or hire a

00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,010
different firm if we come in we need to

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,200
be able to have a two-way communication

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,400
it's not a dictatorship it's not I come

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,620
in and just tell you how your IT

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,620
infrastructure is going to run but we

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,300
get input we get to say hey have you

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,190
considered this solution have you looked

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,130
at the software have you heard about the

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:31,130
our lord and savior linus torvalds you

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,410
know if if i can't be if that is not a

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,850
conversation that we can have you always

00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,050
have the right to say no you always have

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,100
the right to say that's not the

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,350
direction that we're gonna go in our

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,550
company you can say that but we need to

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,650
be at least be able to have the

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:48,230
conversation and so we're not robotic

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:49,580
hands we're consultants right the whole

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,610
thing with great power comes great

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,590
responsibility when you get when you

00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,300
earn your clients trust what you will

00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,880
find is you find yourself in an

00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,760
incredible position of power I work for

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,350
some very awesome people that never want

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,790
to talk to me and I'm okay with that I

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,110
understand they're busy and they've got

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,290
things to do and there's a particular

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:12,980
law firm and they have offices all over

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:16,640
the Midwest and the owner as you might

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,860
imagine is insanely busy and so it's not

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,810
uncommon for me to call him if I have to

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,490
call him and I try to keep that to him

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,350
hey we need this piece of equipments

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,060
$15,000 you want to buy it yes or no yes

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,640
does it solve a problem it usually does

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,570
it question yes okay buy it and that's

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,770
all he wants

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,720
once a year you just won't send the bill

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,660
in the mail but get the problem fixed

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,070
and and I've learned over time with him

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,290
there's a threshold that he doesn't want

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,150
to be bothered under and and that's

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,400
great I'm perfectly fine doing that on

00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,800
the other side of the spectrum we have I

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,870
had I just was chatting at a guy from

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,670
with Linux that's North West and I was

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,980
out in the parking lot and he's having a

00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:54,020
conversation with him and he said kind

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,240
of sheepish ly I want to hire you guys

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,500
to do some IT work but I kind of have a

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
weird request I said what's that he said

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,090
well I would like you to show me how to

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,070
do it so that I can manage my own IT

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,350
infrastructure is that weird it's not at

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:09,560
all we're not a vendor lock-in our

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,940
contracts we want to re-earn your your

00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,590
business we want to make sure that we're

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,330
adding value at the point if you can

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,950
manage your IT infrastructure yourself

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,810
and you have the money to do so and you

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,460
have the time to do so by all means do

00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,860
it we will help you we'll help you make

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,690
that transition and so what we did the

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,490
agreement that hit that him and Elton's

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,440
be technologies reached was we

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,030
essentially set up a thing where he said

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,370
all right when you ask us to do work you

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,110
get a choice do you want us to outline

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,180
the steps we would take and then you try

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,560
to do them and then if something goes

00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,000
wrong let us know and we'll step in and

00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,620
fix it or do you want us to set the

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,150
whole thing up and then give you

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,520
instructions of how we did that and then

00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,740
you can try it and and so he said well I

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,270
want to set it up myself and then I want

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,940
you to double-check everything so that's

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,770
fine now does he pay us for that yes but

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,810
in the long run is he kind of getting a

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,250
free IT education on top and he's a

00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,830
smart guy right i mean is that a linux

00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,200
best he's getting a free itea education

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,180
on top of his consulting services yes he

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
is and in four or five years is he going

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,230
to be at a point where he can do

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,680
everything himself maybe and that's an

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,680
okay thing that the point is to align

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,760
your interest with their interest and I

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,250
mentioned this in my talk

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,270
yester pride a and I'll mention it again

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,400
today a protonmail is a great example of

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,960
a company that aligns its interests with

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,330
its customers interest the same thing

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,100
that that that motivates and excites the

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,510
people that work at protonmail are the

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,820
same thing that excites and motivates

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,070
its users to spend money with them so

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,420
how do you how do you earn trust with a

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,590
client if it can't be purchased well

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,510
there's a couple of things you can do

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,030
right you can give a demo of your

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,759
product or service you can walk into a

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:45,159
place and say hey I under

00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,019
because it's a it is a daunting thing as

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,769
a business owner to walk into a business

00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:53,109
and say hey I understand that you have

00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:55,719
somebody managing your IT I want to make

00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:58,449
you a better deal and to be honest with

00:23:55,719 --> 00:24:01,839
you cold cold calling probably has I

00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:03,549
think like an 11% close ratio so the

00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,079
chances of you actually making sales do

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,429
it's not an effective sales method but

00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,809
every once in a while you want to get

00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,739
rid of a competitor or everyone's know

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,690
well there's just something that you're

00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,639
like that would look good to have to be

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,259
able to say that we do that place and so

00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:18,219
we'll do it and say listen what do we

00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:19,419
have to do give me a number give a demo

00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:23,199
of your product or services especially

00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:24,519
if you're starting out hey I'm uh you

00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:26,649
know we just started up here we're local

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,849
inside of the area I just wanted to drop

00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,529
off a couple cards and give you a

00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:31,569
complimentary you know four hours of a

00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,829
free troubleshooting and they give us a

00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:34,029
shot I think which I think you'll like

00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:35,440
what you find you'll find that after you

00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:36,759
hire us you won't be able to get rid of

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,919
us because you're gonna be that happy

00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:40,419
with the service give up a give a demo

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,359
one of the things one of the sales

00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:46,359
tactics that we use all the time

00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:48,849
we sell access points and and Wi-Fi

00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,679
systems for hotels right and oftentimes

00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:52,089
they'll there's there's all of these

00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,319
fly-by-night installers they come in

00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,429
they throw a couple access points in the

00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:55,029
ceiling they walk out never to be heard

00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,099
from again

00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:59,229
and it has made hotel owners very very

00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:01,179
nervous and very reluctant to enter in

00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:03,190
to do two service agreements to provide

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,049
this stuff right and so one of the sales

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,359
tactics we use is we say hey listen let

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:09,549
us come in we'll do the install for free

00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,159
after 90 days if everything is working

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,959
fine we'll send you a bill in the bill

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,940
if after 90 days you're unhappy with

00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:17,409
anything for any reason call us we'll

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,749
come pick the stuff up and be on our way

00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:21,909
and put on whatever you had to pour and

00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:24,219
you'd be on your way to date we have

00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,719
never once had a hotel call us back and

00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:28,659
say yeah come pick up your stuff and get

00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:30,399
out because once they find out that hey

00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:31,659
that all of that stuff actually works

00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,979
that's really great he provided the

00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,719
service he said he was going to provide

00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:37,269
our guests are not complaining

00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:38,889
they have internet it works well then

00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:41,859
they look and go that's a small price to

00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:43,479
pay and what it does is it earns you the

00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:45,159
trust for the next time you want to make

00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:47,379
a sale you won't have to give away a

00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,539
free demo right the next time you go to

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,249
make the sale for your initial

00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,959
investment of in our case you know a

00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:55,690
couple thousand bucks and access points

00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:56,650
for that initial investment the next one

00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,300
they want to buy five

00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,290
another server a $10,000 server who do

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,210
you think they're gonna call because

00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,250
we've established trust second thing

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,900
talk is cheap I know a lot of

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,430
consultants out there that charge every

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,840
time they pick up the phone and more

00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,000
power to you if you have gotten to a

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,590
point in your career where you're that

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,860
valuable and answering the phone

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,390
commands a certain rate by all means

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,490
there's nothing wrong with that but if

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,780
you're starting out one of the things

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,060
that you can do is be the guy that

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,800
answers the phone be the guy that's

00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,420
willing to talk I was trying to get some

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,490
landscaping done on my house I must have

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,740
called seven different local businesses

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,390
to try to get a quote to come do some

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,550
landscaping I can't get anybody to call

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:36,250
me back nobody will even call me back to

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,990
find out what I want to do and and we

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,370
have had people we've gotten clients

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,430
that we've gotten the phone call they

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:43,900
say hey it's Saturday our XYZ place that

00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,250
we usually calls those could you come

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,200
out and help us well guess what happens

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,490
cup enough times of that happening and

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,480
they go well why wouldn't we just go

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,990
with the people that always answer the

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,360
phone 24/7 365 right be available be

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,040
willing to answer the phone and if if

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,560
you get that client that wants to have

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,090
you know 45-minute conversations about

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,980
you know and he essentially wants you to

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,900
do remote troubleshooting put up a

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,880
boundary but if it's just somebody

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,960
saying hey you know I want you to stop

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,580
over I wanted to talk to you about a

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,690
couple of things we have this problem

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,490
because you could you talk a little bit

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,550
about a solution or could we visit about

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,170
a solution I will usually because we've

00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,610
gotten to the point we do this I'll just

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,420
say sure tell you what where would you

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,130
like to be able to take you out for

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,330
lunch somewhere and then the company

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,370
takes them out for lunch and it's a

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,400
really informal nice way to have a

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:29,800
conversation and and fix their problem

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,870
part of that is owning their problem

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,480
when they can tell that you have come

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,130
alongside them and you care about the

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,990
problem the way that they care about the

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,490
problem and you start to show an active

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,220
interest in their business

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,910
all of a sudden again that does a lot to

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,550
reinforce trust when I go into a hotel I

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,070
am NOT above if a guest comes up and

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,290
says handy - towel and the front desk

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,730
clerk is on the phone I can walk five

00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,330
feet and grab a towel it hand it to the

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,710
guest right

00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,120
that guest is waiting there and while

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,010
you're standing in front of their desk

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,270
nobody reads your shirt nobody

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,060
understands that you're separated from

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:06,220
that business and so I have no problem

00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,930
helping out inside of a business if I'm

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,670
paid to be on-site to begin with and

00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,920
show that I have an active interest in

00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,900
that business

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,340
it's not that's your problem you do your

00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,230
thing I'm here to I'm here to fix the

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,300
computer and I'm out right take an

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,580
active interest in the problem and when

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,840
you do that one you'll find I think you

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,100
find more enjoyment in the work because

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,660
you get to know the people you to know

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,670
the business it's it's a fun experience

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:31,170
but the other thing is it reinforces the

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:33,540
idea of trust one thing I see from this

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,580
is what I think if I was to give one

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,130
thing that let us be successful over our

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,270
competition it is this one thing a lot

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,140
of IT companies are willing to are

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,360
essentially approach the market with

00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,700
what they can sell what cannot what

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,920
product can I pull off the the the the

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,530
product shelf and and and pitch it to a

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,820
client and Jim Salter is an excellent

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,550
example of what I'm about to talk about

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,830
because Jim didn't buy a solution off

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,350
the shelf and and and and resell it to a

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,990
customer he built something he took

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,600
existing technology and combine things

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,150
together to create a unique product or

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,120
service that the client values and when

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,170
you can do that you can show that first

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,730
of all you get more control over your

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,130
costs right because you can swap out

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,810
individual components to adjust to your

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,580
profit margin and a shifting market and

00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,250
needs and all that stuff but the other

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,250
side of that is you are unique and you

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,600
offer something over your competition

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,770
when ubiquity came out and ubiquity is

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,900
the company that is running all the

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,200
network equipment here itself when they

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,430
first came out I was working in IT

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,290
everybody laughed at the idea that you

00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,400
were gonna buy these stupid 90 dollar

00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,740
access points and they were gonna

00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,950
compete with our $600 Cisco's you know

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,570
or your $700 ruckus and now what we have

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,730
found is we've switched entirely over to

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,560
unify and unless you have a massive

00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,830
massive massive deployment that requires

00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:56,040
some very very very specific special

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:58,710
Wi-Fi challenges 99% of the time those

00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,260
UAP a/c pros are even or even better the

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,820
HDS will cover you a hundred percent and

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,850
the controller runs on Linux which means

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,950
you can manage multi sites on a single

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,570
controller it's not like the the Meraki

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,220
crap where you have to register from

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,420
account and pay your yearly ransom to

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,880
keep your Wi-Fi up and running which I

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,610
find to be ridiculous absolutely a

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,850
quality product but you have to be agile

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:22,620
enough to say I want to build something

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,190
rather than buy something it doesn't

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,050
have to come

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,360
off the shelf same thing with Asterix

00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,270
right I was talking about Viper li er

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,680
same thing if you're taking in that case

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,350
it's more of a plug-and-play but you're

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:39,510
still combining technologies to build

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:43,260
something of value to the client does

00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:45,450
anybody have any questions so that means

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,500
one of two things either I've explained

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:52,080
everything so perfectly that nobody dare

00:30:49,500 --> 00:31:02,150
challenge me or to I bored you all to

00:30:52,080 --> 00:31:05,550
death and everybody's asleep very well

00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:07,230
split right if you have organizations

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,640
that have been penalized or

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,580
organizations that are subject to being

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,070
penalized for data privacy breaches it's

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,190
huge baking industry healthcare and law

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:22,200
offices they really really care where

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,730
their data is everybody else doesn't pay

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,130
a lot of attention to it to be honest

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,520
with you to throw them a bone in their

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,230
direction that's why I have a job right

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,090
if they want it to be concerned about

00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,800
where their data was storaged or stored

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,870
and what that is Dropbox a better

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,730
solution than purchasing a $5,000 server

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,440
if they wanted to to dig into that

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,640
decision to the depth that you really

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,190
should dig into a decision like that

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,080
before you spend money they probably

00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,400
wouldn't need an IT contract for him so

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,620
to a certain degree they offered that

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,340
decision to us and just say hey what do

00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,440
you think is best

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,600
now we're the kind of company that we

00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,460
just don't believe in hosting on some

00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,280
other product or service but maybe the

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,320
exception of GC because if you need to

00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,410
drop an exchange replacement I don't

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,840
know of another one but the but as far

00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,730
as where actual data goes it totally

00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,980
depends on the industry what we have

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,280
told clients is everything that you can

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,960
keep off of any sort of cloud system you

00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,810
should absolutely do that and if you

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,520
want to do cloud-based stuff own that

00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,720
infrastructure and of course we're happy

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,720
to manage the service form right

00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:39,899
open-source systems for what oh sure

00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:42,570
management so well let's start with

00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:45,899
tickets so we do managed IT services so

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,669
we use OS ticket and OS ticket is one of

00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:49,349
the most underrated project sets out

00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:50,580
there because it has a lot of the

00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:52,559
features not all of them but it has a

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,139
lot of the features that the the big

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,879
proprietary alternatives do but the you

00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,309
can you can self host it you can run it

00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:01,499
yourself you can and the the API lies it

00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,440
tied into a ton of stuff so that's kind

00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:06,299
of the the central hub after the tickets

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,889
are filed invoice ninja is a really

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,899
great piece of open source software for

00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:12,509
dealing with invoicing and accounting

00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:14,519
and and all of those kind of things I

00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:17,639
think of other free and open-source

00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,399
software used from management those are

00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:24,649
the big ones that come to mind oh there

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,659
is i I'm not sure if this is still and

00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:29,190
we can talk afterwards but there is a

00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,119
there are a couple pieces of software

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,440
but I'm not sure if they're still

00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:35,089
actively maintained or not so I'm

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,089
hesitant to say it in a public forum

00:33:53,539 --> 00:34:02,340
mmm-hmm so what I would here's what I

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,470
would tell you what I would tell you is

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,450
this if we sit down and we are having a

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,210
conversation in the lobby right and I

00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,950
said to you I have the best malware

00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,500
solution for you it is fantastic for

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,730
only 1995 we're gonna take your computer

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,780
we're going to do a scan to it it's

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,190
going to do a three layered approach

00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,260
what we call the three layer approach to

00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,540
security it's I just make up all this

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,359
you know buzzword bingo and shoot it in

00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,649
your direction right maybe 10% of people

00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,909
would be they came to you and asked the

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,919
question so after all they're probably

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,720
50 percent of the way to a sale maybe

00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:32,700
that works out for you right but most

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,349
people don't respond to that most people

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,149
don't want to be sold to and that's

00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:38,940
where salespeople get a bad rap but the

00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:41,520
truth is our salespeople and I'm biased

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,290
right but our salespeople are awesome

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,329
because they don't sell to anybody they

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,530
they're just available to talk to if we

00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,329
sat down in the lobby and I said hey you

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,399
know the other day I have to tell you

00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:54,899
there's a great project that that exists

00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,490
and it's this thing and it has this

00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,500
piece of software and it you know it

00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,960
does a really good job because it's it's

00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,339
not immune to virus or malware but it's

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,930
based on this thing called Linux and

00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,040
you're able to run it on your laptop and

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,630
depending on what your work so it might

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,589
work for you I'd be happy to show it to

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,829
you if you want to check out and see

00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:13,349
what you think that is a way more a

00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:14,970
palatable approach to sales because now

00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,740
I'm not selling you something I am

00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,540
you're coming to me with a problem I'm

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,980
suggesting a solution something that I

00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,619
found but in order for that to be

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,700
effective you have to have one you have

00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,069
to have extensive knowledge of that

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,780
product or service right the worst thing

00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:29,880
a salesperson can say is yeah I'm not

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,190
really sure how that works right the

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,450
second thing is you need to be able to

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,940
be passionate about yourself

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,260
I can tell clients eight or whatever it

00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,000
is I recommending it let me show you how

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,020
I use it because this is what we read in

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,380
our office and we don't have any

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,380
problems

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:16,560
mm-hmm oh I I don't don't I'm very

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,930
upfront and honest in fact oh that's

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,890
that's why sale that's why consultations

00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,660
are so important to begin with right

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,040
before we ever roll out a server

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,390
solution before we ever roll out an

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,650
infrastructure solution the very first

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,690
thing we're doing is making sure we

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,200
absolutely understand the client's needs

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,180
and then you need to pare that now

00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,980
oftentimes what you'll find is you find

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,900
a solution it has a couple of caveats to

00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,180
their workflow but if you're upfront and

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,580
honest with them about that they're they

00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,740
don't care right where the problem comes

00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,540
in is where people promise the moon and

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,710
then all of a sudden it comes to

00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,000
deployment time and all of a sudden that

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,350
thing that you told them it could do and

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,060
doesn't quite work it's not a totally

00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,110
big feature we don't really have time to

00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,150
set it up but I didn't really have the

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,890
expertise to play with it and that's

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,390
where people start to get upset and then

00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,350
they go you you lied to me you told me

00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,890
you could do this thing it didn't do

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,330
that thing the the the answer to how to

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,160
deal with that is to be very open

00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,260
upfront and honest with the client hey

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,880
this is what it will do and this is not

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,130
what it will do is that an acceptable

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,070
compromise and sometimes what you find

00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,360
is you can you can kind of iterate right

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,650
you take a problem that they thought

00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,940
they wanted one solution for and you

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,260
split it up and say well what if we did

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,400
this thing over here to solve that

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,060
problem in this thing over there to

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,600
solve that problem we've done that any

00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,600
other questions

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:40,740
mm-hmm-hmm that's a great question how

00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:45,870
do you train how do you train people for

00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:47,310
software compliance um HIPAA is so one

00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,740
of one of the one of the new rules with

00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,420
HIPAA and I remember is 2017-2018 when

00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,560
this went into effect 15 feet from the

00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,960
nearest nation when you're checking it

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,730
right nearest paperwork or whatever we

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,380
work in all sorts of medical offices

00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,280
that don't have 15 feet from the desk to

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,020
the front of the door like everybody

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,910
would be outside in 40 degree weather

00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:08,670
it's not possible to be in compliance in

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:11,250
some cases right the I guess what I

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,360
would say is is this you so first of all

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,410
you need somebody on staff if you're

00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,390
gonna deal with those kinds of things

00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,970
right so we have a security person on

00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,560
staff and his function in life is when

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,150
we get a medical client to say okay

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,760
let's review what the current state of

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:25,500
HIPAA is let's recur let's you know

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,300
let's review what the what the

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,200
requirements are and what our job is and

00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,440
how it relates to this specific

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,600
application and then they offer that

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,980
into the when we go to do the the

00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,750
deployment notes they say okay when you

00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,120
go out here a couple of things that you

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,680
need to make sure you hit and what I

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,260
found with and we've done everything

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,210
from from HIPAA to law offices to

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,150
banking to the most stringent one is is

00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:50,370
we work with some nuclear stuff and in

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,220
that case what I found is for the most

00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,680
part the government will tell you what

00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,410
you need to do if you just ask and you

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,950
just say hey you do this this is what

00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,470
we're doing

00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,940
I understand these this is the document

00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,130
that that has all of these things we

00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,170
ball at ABCD tier something you have a

00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,640
question on or here is a physical

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,300
constraint I can't get around what can

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,130
we do about that

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,560
and having that that dialogue with them

00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:18,950
I found them to be pretty reasonable and

00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,950
say don't worry about it mm-hmm

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,290
to Jim's point an effective sales method

00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,720
is what I do is I won't directly tell

00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,280
them you can't host it on site I'll just

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,810
give them a price that's enough to

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,860
convince them you know here's here's

00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,850
what here's what it's gonna take you

00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,930
want you're gonna have to hire five

00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:20,690
people you're gonna have to do this

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,760
banking industry very similar right all

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:24,740
of the all of this all of the things

00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,810
that they have that that that have to be

00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,280
in place and separation of physical

00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,230
machines and encrypted drives and all

00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,730
that stuff by the time you get down that

00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,530
list a lot of times they go or you could

00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:47,000
pay twenty nine a month and they'll do

00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:47,960
all that stuff for you we're not but

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,240
it's something I would very much be

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:56,390
interested in chatting about the the see

00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:05,180
see excellent you know why cuz Jim earns

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:07,340
trust what it is well so to kind of come

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,050
full circle right the reason I even know

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:13,130
about say annoyed is because I'm walking

00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:15,290
down the hallway and I'm looking to and

00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,950
this time right VMware is really popular

00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:20,720
and and and and Microsoft is trying to

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,580
launch you know they're hyper nonsense

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,650
and I walk past and here's Jim sitting

00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,200
in his computer with these four monitors

00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,370
and he's like here check this out I push

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,590
one button here look I just

00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,210
just intentionally infected this Windows

00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,830
box with ransomware now watch the

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,690
I pushed this button look the windows

00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,660
box went back up to the last snapshot

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,460
I'm like holy crap that's cool yeah

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,840
we're not doing we're not I would what's

00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,430
interesting to me about Santa is that

00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,440
you're doing everything on CFS right and

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,630
that has a much higher fault tolerance

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,920
than than exa fest but right now what

00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,350
we're doing is we're using the snapshot

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:59,710
feature built into verse which is I

00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:59,710
admit not as ideal but it works yes

00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,820
mm-hmm

00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,820
trust

00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:36,960
mm-hmm okay so first of all exactly I

00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,510
would that's exactly what I was going to

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,340
say that is that is a that is the thing

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,260
that they use to try to get you to buy a

00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,300
different device but the truth is the

00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,160
hip there's no such thing as a HIPAA

00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,930
compliant device it doesn't exist HIPAA

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,070
doesn't certified devices HIPPA lays

00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,100
exactly right they lay out

00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,420
specifications and then you have to you

00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,770
have to meet those specifications they

00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,040
could care less what device you use to

00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:03,720
to to get there the answer to that how

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,880
you deal with that is to again yeah man

00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,430
that is if you're not on so if you can't

00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,080
go have a comb this is why I we tend to

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:12,150
we branched out a little bit into trying

00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,830
to do remote support and we do it we do

00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,420
it if people approach us we don't

00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,620
actively sell it and that is why because

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,780
I need to be able to walk into the

00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:22,190
clients office and say listen here's

00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,190
where the here's where the breakdown is

00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:34,290
yep that's right yeah it's just very

00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,600
difficult to establish that level of

00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,760
trust especially when I mean there are

00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,170
some dirty dirty deals so they have you

00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,700
know especially when you have these

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,130
vendors that are selling a software and

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,160
then pretend to say that something that

00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,050
they're not affiliated with at all you

00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,490
know isn't there what you find out is

00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,810
usually if you dig into it a little bit

00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,280
there's usually a backdoor connection

00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,870
somewhere right either another part of

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,670
their company installs it either they

00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,020
offer as a side service or they're

00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,720
partnered with somebody that you know

00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,220
where they yeah so that's and that's

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,810
that's a super frustrating situation

00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,550
it's also something just totally

00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,410
unrelated to this talk whatsoever it's

00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,000
also something that we need to be aware

00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,730
of if you're doing managed service

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,800
providing you need to be watching what

00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:16,470
the market is doing because right now

00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,200
you know McDonald's and and and sport

00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,360
clips and and all these large chains

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,090
essentially are trying to centralize

00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,220
their IT with big big big MSPs that are

00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:28,080
that are centrally located and in the

00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,270
next five to ten years I'd say it's

00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,740
going to really start to challenge the

00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:34,140
little guys that are that are local and

00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,390
in town we negotiated a contract with

00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,710
Wyndham to handle the Wi-Fi stuff and

00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,119
the applique

00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,250
Haitian was like a hundred and seventy

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,630
some pages long and because they want

00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,430
you to be at the scale that you're able

00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,380
to support any Wyndham Hotel across the

00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,550
country now the reality is they just

00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,730
send sales leads and so you can just

00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,349
deny them but to just to pace people a

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,700
team of people for two months to sit

00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:55,109
down and collect information to fill out

00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,480
paperwork to get your foot in the door

00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,220
that's not something that a lot of that

00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,560
that a lot of small guys are gonna be

00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,030
able to handle it's a key part of our

00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,460
revenue stream to the point that it was

00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,660
worth it for us but keep an eye on that

00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,640
if you're thinking about going into

00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,349
managed service providing I'm not saying

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,849
don't do it I'm just saying have a plan

00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,380
of how you're going to address the fact

00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:14,490
that there are big national companies

00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,589
that are gonna compete with you and

00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:20,180
they're gonna negotiate contracts far

00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:20,180
beyond your ability to negotiate our

00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:34,920
core competency is again coming on-site

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,869
and coming alongside that client I don't

00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,089
think we are structured and I don't know

00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:41,820
that I am interested in restructuring us

00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:44,250
to try to compete on on a national level

00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:47,310
right so what does the future look like

00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:49,290
probably more specialized probably more

00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:51,180
specialized consulting specialized can

00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:54,150
you know deployments and stuff like that

00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:56,640
things that larger MSPs aren't going to

00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,859
be able to to do the other thing and I'm

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,470
not afraid to admit this we also work

00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:03,510
with major national managed service

00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,310
providers and say hey we'll subcontract

00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,220
for you because at the end of the day if

00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,839
we know that a given portion of our

00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,210
business is going to be sucked up by

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,040
that entity well then I'm gonna go make

00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,170
sure that my I'm at least in decent

00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,609
graces with that entity so that we can

00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:20,130
have we can try and fight for a piece of

00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:22,020
the pie back but it is an active it is

00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,820
something that I'm actively watching and

00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,530
I'm actively concerned about and so yeah

00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,570
we're absolutely taking steps to try to

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,710
say what can we do to deliver to the

00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,080
market or kind of reposition ourselves

00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,510
to make sure that we were still viable

00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,220
when when these changes start to make

00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,619
the thing that you're always going to

00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,240
have is a local guy right these the the

00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,940
large MSPs they can never get equipment

00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,320
on time and like we had a business call

00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,599
us and there they were client and they

00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,070
they were forced to go with an MSP for

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,260
part of their network we still handled

00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,340
the the the admin side but all the guest

00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,930
stuff was handled by major

00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,940
national company they had a problem with

00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,290
one of their core devices and they just

00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,430
said what will overnight you want but

00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,200
it's Friday so probably won't get there

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,610
till Monday or Tuesday what are we

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,590
supposed to do until then we have guests

00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,090
we have people that are sorry nothing we

00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,560
can do right so they called us back and

00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:07,420
said you know screw it we don't care

00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,400
we'll just we can't run business like

00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,990
this and so then they fought you know

00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,060
through their chain thing but that's a

00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,160
unique example but that's one thing that

00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,650
you can do is yes as a local guy be

00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,930
available and either you get the client

00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:31,030
or you at least can pick up some of the

00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:34,450
subcontracting cool Oh mm-hmm yes yeah

00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,970
it's it's all web-based and it it it

00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,440
yeah it's it it's scalable right so

00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,900
there's the the entry thing which is

00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,000
completely free just lets you

00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,850
essentially create invoices if you pay

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,130
for the pro version then you get white

00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,780
labeling and so it does all the white

00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,850
labeling for you plus you have the

00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,470
ability to do inventory and a bunch of

00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,970
other stuff but yeah if you just want to

00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,220
create a basic advice although I'm not

00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,560
afraid to admit also when we started I

00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,570
had an open office template and I would

00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,250
physically type in you know inside of a

00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:05,020
little table this is a product that's

00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,910
the price and there was no inventory the

00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,470
inventory was in my noggin and I went

00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,730
all right so one of those guess I have

00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,750
one less of those it's probably order

00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:22,110
one more of those that was ended please

00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:22,110
yeah I mean we all started somewhere

00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:36,400
oh yeah oh absolutely

00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:38,430
mm-hmm yeah so especially what we have

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,690
we we call it an initial deployment

00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,700
additional deployment worksheet there's

00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:45,100
there's a there's a piece of paper that

00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,420
every every time we go out on site

00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,850
that piece of paper has to be filled out

00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,080
by a technician top to bottom and the

00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,490
well the very first time we go out

00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,830
there's a site survey that says what's

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,330
deer but the initial deployment is here

00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,620
all of the things we have done and so

00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,590
there's documentation all the way around

00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:02,740
and every time we have a binder on each

00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:04,420
site that has all of the documentation

00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:07,570
in it of course we have a copy of it as

00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,340
well and in our agreement you know in

00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,980
all of our contracts we retain the right

00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,940
keep that information as documentation

00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,910
for seven years

00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,170
which I was told by a lawyer is what we

00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,820
need to do to make sure that we don't

00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,840
get sued if they fire us and then come

00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,510
back and want information that we don't

00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,280
have I couldn't he couldn't really give

00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,780
me a real metric as to why that there's

00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,140
that seven year period but that's what

00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:32,410
he said

00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:33,550
so I'll pass it on again yeah but we

00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,940
know I mean we don't keep the patient

00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:38,830
information right but but anyway all the

00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,240
documentation is is is kept in every

00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,190
time we make a change anything

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,980
documentation is put into that binder

00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:46,570
and left on site as well as we keep an

00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,250
internal copy usually just in the ticket

00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,650
notes as hey we change the password of

00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,120
this thing or we you know set the IP

00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,250
address to that thing or whatever by the

00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,690
way one other thing because I was

00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,420
talking to a guy and this dis bit him

00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:00,640
hard have a copy of your static IP

00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,830
address assignments don't trust the DHCP

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,450
in the router to to keep track of all

00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,400
that that's fine for if you want to

00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:11,430
manage it that way to die that's not

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,430
documentation so side hallway track

00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:20,220
oh yeah all the time but I have an

00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,540
answer to that the you know what we tell

00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,860
people first of all I'm not the only one

00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,060
working there so there's plenty of

00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,890
people and there's somebody right ready

00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,300
to to come over here we'll have somebody

00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,310
the same day the other part of that is

00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,840
in this this is one of the reasons some

00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,370
places will do a thing where they assign

00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,260
a given technician to the same client so

00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,550
every time that client calls that take

00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,710
the same technician goes out and they

00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:40,080
they feel like they able to bond and

00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:43,050
stuff like that I understand that I try

00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,550
to rotate people around so every couple

00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:46,650
times the the client never gets used to

00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,060
seeing only one person and I like to be

00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,920
the person that's on-site the least

00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,390
because that avoids that exact syndrome

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,680
of what if you get hit by a bus I don't

00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,850
really think to ask the question because

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,230
it's always somebody else that's that's

00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,400
coming in to fix it so it kind of speaks

00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,090
for itself

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,400
but I also have partnered with another

00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,990
managed service provider that does local

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,430
but does the same thing that we do and I

00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,470
we just kind of have a gentleman's

00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,600
agreement that hey if something happens

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,640
here's our keys to the kingdom here's

00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,590
how you get them and so if something

00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,180
happens this is the plan of action make

00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,590
sure that you know all these clients

00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,930
aren't up with creek without a paddle

00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,800
and that we've just kind of worked that

00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,590
out because we've been friends for years

00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,600
but but but yeah have a plan on what to

00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:26,700
do and if you don't have a plan at least

00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,170
have at least a get put enough

00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,270
documentation that the client can

00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:50,630
formulate a plan in the event of your

00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:50,630
unlikely death sure right

00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:59,609
right yep yeah oh that's great yeah you

00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,970
go above and beyond trying to get rid of

00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:10,589
yourself yeah I yeah I've not gone so

00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:13,160
far as saying it right sure yeah

00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:14,849
absolutely yeah for sure

00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,619
alright I think we're out of time but

00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:17,970
thank you very much I'll stick around if

00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,240
there's any other questions well we'll

00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:22,420
take them

00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,420
