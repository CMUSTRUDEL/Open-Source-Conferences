run away now and by the way just as a

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,129
random bit of coincidental trivia both

Eugene and Brian from Alberta I don't

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,440

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,210
polite and we're polite - I don't I

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,239

who also helped out with the network a

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,740
lot as well

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:29,380
[Applause]

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,970
and I'm sure there's loads more people

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,170
I'm forgetting we are moving from

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,960
ketchup mode to being ahead of the

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,090
8-ball so the dates for self 2020 are

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,100
already on the website the room block is

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,110
already on the website and available and

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,600
by the way the only other time we've had

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,460
the room block available this early the

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,190
first time I checked it I was down to

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,110
less than 20 rooms so I wouldn't dawdle

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,300
getting your room for next year they go

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,550
really quickly

00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,399
also our prospectus is up for next year

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,440
and we will be at scale we'll be back at

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,240
OLF in places like that so we'll be back

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,210
in the field and ahead of the 8-ball for

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,739
a change the videos are coming up soon

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,390
for the remote attendees who are

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,970
probably hearing this way later than

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,370
they want to we hit a YouTube API limit

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,770
we turned on billing for the account and

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,230
added billing information but you have

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,910
to have a human at YouTube lifts the

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,000
limit which means of course nearly

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,110
impossible so we're working on that

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,660
we've been uploading a lot of videos

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,610
manually I believe Zach said they're

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,890
gonna be uploaded in the next day or so

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,180
the ones that are missing and within the

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,950
next week after we've gone to sleep

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,290
basically so and we had a couple people

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,420
asked me about the self in your

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,090
neighborhood bit particularly in Atlanta

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,280
and Gainesville so if you're in those

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,630
areas feel free to email me what I told

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,220
the people who asked me in both

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,890
instances was when the case of

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,480
Gainesville talked the Gator lug get

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,430
Gator lug to sponsor space at the

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,380
University of Florida that takes care of

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,459
almost all the logistics problems on my

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,680
end have av trunk will travel similar

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,329
thing for Atlanta talk to lug at Georgia

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,980
Tech get them to get space at Georgia

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,290
Tech at Klaus or at the Georgia Tech

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,430
Hotel and Convention Center half trunk

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,590
will travel so if any you guys have

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,480
questions for the conference so to speak

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,790
since this is like it I we've never

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,120
really like had an address thing oh also

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,010
every year including this one supporting

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,320
attendees have beaten out our biggest

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,700
sponsor so once again supporting

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,090
attendees are the biggest sponsor of the

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,090
conference

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,500
so thank you all for coming and if you

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:51,310
have any questions for the conference I

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:54,100
would be happy to entertain them ok so

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,690
self in your neighborhood is because you

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,260
know we started this event because we

00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,720
liked

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,750
OLF and we like scale but we didn't like

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,390
having to go to a different time zone or

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,820
practically to Canada to go to them so I

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,920
totally get wanting to have an event

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,600
like this in your backyard and not

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,670
having to travel all the time for it

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,790
we are absolutely willing to do that but

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,260
we want someone local in that area to

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,700
show that they have some skin in the

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,400
game and they're willing to put in some

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,950
effort and so my the very first thing I

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,140
pushed back with is work with the local

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,730
look at the local big university to get

00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,950
space because they can get space at

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,050
their university for virtually free and

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,780
that eliminates nearly all the logistics

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:42,270
problems from making the event happen

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:42,270
any other questions yes okay

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:54,430
the question was both next year could we

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,140
have training for speakers we were kind

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,030
of so the network thing pushed

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,040
everything back like we didn't even have

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:09,010
the speaker boxes flashed into what

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:11,560
Friday the intent was to have those

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,240
boxes at the podium with labels and then

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,920
to have a human at that trunk to make

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,540
sure everything was okay before they

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,310
then walked out of the room that was the

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,480
intent but you know we're we're good

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:28,500
friends with Murphy not you Murphy the

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,500
other Murphy any other questions

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,010
the hotel block for next year is already

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,270
open and by the time you book your room

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,940
if you do it right now you're probably

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,780
not at all the first it gets buried

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:49,510
pretty quickly

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:52,930
oh so the way it works is if we if we

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,420
book out our space the hotel will know

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,490
that and add rooms transparently without

00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,290
me having to know them and it's when we

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,600
get close to the event that I have to

00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,490
stay on them to add rooms so if you book

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,870
now and you just crush us and that's

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,340
already happened by the way we've had to

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,410
add rooms to the block whole Wednesday

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,040
and Thursday next year that's already

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,810
happened that's perfectly fine and as we

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,630
run out of rooms in our block we just

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,160
keep gobbling up this hotel so if you

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,930
booked it out really early we'll just

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:28,480
take the whole hotel there they're

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:30,910
absolutely fine with that it's it's kind

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,230
of a bell-curve thing as you go like the

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,020
top of the bell curve is definitely

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,610
Saturday but it's definitely easy to say

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,470
we're way over half the hotel on

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,360
Saturday probably more than two-thirds

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,300
of the hotel on Saturday and we're

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,160
probably close to or just above half on

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,710
Friday as well

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,550
sunday falls off a cliff Thursday is the

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:54,150
bright but right as it starts to ramp up

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,150
any other questions

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,490
yes so we didn't plan too heavily in the

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,930
East Wing which is the other wing of the

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,260
hotel this year because we wanted to get

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,760
it wired up we Zak ran fiber-optic cable

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,800
through the conduits between the two

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,950
wings and we rolled our own wired

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,530
network in that wing as well so now that

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,780
we have our our we have a network on top

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,340
of the network here that's yeah we've

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,890
we've more or less replaced the entire

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,660
hotel's networking here with our own we

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,810
just pop it out of the ceiling and turn

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,180
it on once a year so now that we have

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,460
that room wire that wing wire just like

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,410
we have this wing we have the hotel

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,300
carte blanche these are the first two

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,730
years where we've had the whole hotel so

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:52,830
next year we also have the whole hotel

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:55,200
so we're good on space there is not

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,960
enough air conditioning for the South in

00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,390
June with about you know with the

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:09,360
density of humans drinking coffee that

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:10,560
we have here so it's difficult it's more

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,270
difficult than you think to give an

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,070
answer to that because when you go

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,530
through our website and register to

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,780
attend you can register more than one

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,110
person and the way that's reported in

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,700
the back end is just orders I it looks

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,440
to me for all the world and we do it by

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,120
badges it looks to me for all the world

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,890
like physical attendance was roughly the

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,440
same as last year low six hundreds but

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,360
remote attendees is at least more than

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,640
double than last year maybe close to

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,219
triple I had people emailing me asking

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,310
to get remote attendee codes for their

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,719
entire IT department for training not a

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,580
bad deal if you think about it five

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,270
bucks for training for an entire weekend

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,220
is not a bad deal so I suspect the

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,500
numbers overall are going to be up of

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,480
triple digits but a lot of that's going

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,020
to be from remote attendees really

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,020
ramping up

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,330
we are absolutely open to workshops it's

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,520
it's a thing of if you're willing to

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,190
submit that content I'll entertain it in

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,290
the past we've had a day-long

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,880
soup-to-nuts networking workshop where

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,040
we go through all the layers of the

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,650
stack one by one and we give you the

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,900
full life and that guy the guy who did

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,940
that talk for us a couple years ago

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,560
that's what he does at IBM he tours

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:37,480
within IBM and trains their own

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:40,540
employees on networking a kid track so

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,250
yeah like it's a case of submit the

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,260
content like I haven't really

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,670
aggressively looked for the content but

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:59,200
I wouldn't turn it away if it was

00:09:45,670 --> 00:10:00,700
submitted either if it were possible to

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,260
add more hours to the day I would have

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,700
done that long ago if you know Superman

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,260
and you can get him to fly around the

00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,260
earth a couple times I'd appreciate it

00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,720
cirrhosis as a service

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,210
the videos are gonna be on YouTube and

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,250
Vimeo and archive.org I am quite frankly

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,200
disgusted and done with YouTube is the

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:47,220
be-all end-all I'm not very happy with

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:49,770
how they run things there anymore yes so

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,390
like had I not been so busy I was gonna

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,340
use the fad internet connection here and

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,980
I brought like my archival drives with

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,690
me with all the past videos instead like

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,340
while he's uploading this year's I'm

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,200
gonna be uploading the back catalogue to

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,870
Vimeo and archive.org it's gonna take a

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,070
while on Vimeo cuz I haven't looked in a

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,290
while but I think they do have

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,390
limitations on how much you can sling

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,010
into Vimeo each day but on the plus side

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,970
you don't need a human to tell you

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,360
you've done too much

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:20,520
oh no Vimeo is still alive and well the

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,780
whole reason why I said Vimeo is I'm but

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,350
I like watching the Joe Rogan experience

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,060
podcast he uploads to Vimeo and YouTube

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,920
YouTube takes even him down all the time

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,510
and if he can't get someone at YouTube

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,030
to straighten out what luck do I have

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:43,680
whereas Vimeo hardly ever takes his

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:45,900
content down we could we can always use

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,520
more volunteers if you go to the website

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,380
there's a forum you could submit Brian

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,420
gets all the information from that forum

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:59,160
and he does email those people every

00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:01,200
year yes the needs are yes even if you

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,700
know nothing technical you if you're

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,160
capable of lifting and moving heavy

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,600
things or having a nice bright smile at

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,190

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,500

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,760

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,380

call them Gophers any other questions

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,860
well Yana DB was pretty much talks

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,630
almost the whole time it's just they

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,600
weren't recorded because we we were

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:12,740
wanting to get our four trunks set and

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:14,690
working before we expanded well there

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,760
they were so like the talks that were in

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:23,270
Yana DB were out of the regular RF

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,710
people yes so even though wasn't

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,330
streamed and recorded simply because

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,640
like we wanted to get the four we had

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,130
working properly first everyone who was

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,900
speaking in Yana DB was someone who

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,640
submitted an RFP granted they weren't in

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,770
the guide you can direct your complaints

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,330
here for that one that's my that's my

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,820
bad yeah that that was that was my bad I

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,710
had to do some last-minute very very

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,089
last-minute

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,160
removal of things from the guide and

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,380
that was right up against the print

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,760
deadline so I didn't have nearly as much

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,760
