00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,750
know and I've gotten a chance to meet

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,630
over the last few days and some of you I

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,910
don't know and I'd be really excited if

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,550
you came up after the talk and we get to

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,320
know each other just a little bit

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,869
because as much as I know everyone came

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,420
here to see speakers pretty faces I know

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,619
that everyone's really excited about

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,560
getting a chance to hang out with people

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,450
get to get to talk to people get to make

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,180
relationships that will span years and

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,579
miles and and for some of us even span

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,329
oceans but so this talk I'm really

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,850
excited you're here

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,989
because I'm going to give you all the

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,110
secrets that you're going to need

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,180
everything that open-source advocates

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,329
have been hiding from you I'm going to

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,070
reveal today okay that might be over

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,059
selling it a little bit but you know hi

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,649
we we had good food we we've been having

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,270
a good time so why not oversell it a

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,500
little bit but I want to give you all

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,150
the secrets that you need to know about

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,650
open source about the community about

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,270
how to get started both personally and

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,900
professionally and Who am I - Who am I -

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,580
to give this talk I can tell you that if

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,790
it weren't for some of the people in

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,070
this room and if it weren't for what

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,680
what they stood for what they shared

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,299
with me if it weren't for the community

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,920
I would not be where I am today I

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,560
certainly wouldn't be on this stage I

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,799
wouldn't be I wouldn't be where I'm at

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,610
my career and I wouldn't be I wouldn't

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,350
be successful personally because when

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,509
when you get parts of your life going

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,100
right when when you get your career

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,320
right when you have people that you can

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,590
mentor when you have people that mentor

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,479
you when you get those things in order

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,220
your life continues to improve it gets

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,619
better and better and better and every

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,390
year every month every day I'm just more

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,369
excited and more surprised as to what

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,920
what my life has been bringing to me and

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,530
a lot of that is due to the reasons why

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,820
we're here

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,810
so I am the Solutions Architect for

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,700
gillip we are a continuous where we are

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,650
a CI CD of

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,190
development application that spans the

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,360
entire pipeline I I've also done some

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,300
some guest hosting on I've also done a

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,500
lot of guest hosting on some podcasts

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:31,080
looking to start my own here in the near

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,820
future and I'm I'm a lousy gamer so but

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,970
I have been pretty addicted to elder

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,240
scrolls lately and I put down an open

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,220
source wizard to be facetious but with

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,870
the community I've had the pleasure of

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,430
working with the genome Foundation with

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,370
Jupiter broadcasting with the ask Noah

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,110
show I've I've had the option the

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,720
opportunity to go to conferences like

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,790
this and share my experiences and make

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,280
some friendships so open source Wizards

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,080
just facetious for I've gotten the

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,720
chance to do some really amazing things

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,610
with some brilliant people and and

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,160
that's kind of what I wanted when I want

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,540
to share with you today

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:12,120
so who are all of you and today I'm

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,100
hoping to talk to folks that are new to

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,380
the new to the community people that

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,910
have heard about this this Linux thing

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,900
but haven't really gotten to do anything

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,370
with it maybe there's someone in the

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,900
audience who's been a longtime IT

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,360
professional somebody who makes money

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,880
off of off of what they do maybe you're

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,340
a Systems Administrator or a DBA or or

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,959
maybe a work in security but maybe

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,600
you're like me a few years ago and you

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,550
just aren't getting the you aren't

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,650
getting what you want out of your your

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,260
career there's something missing because

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,800
that's my story and that's that's what

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,120
what inspired this talk maybe maybe you

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,010
don't work in IT at all and you're

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,330
looking for a new start so you you found

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,130
this someone's drugged you to this

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,570
conference and hanging out with all

00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:01,230
these nerds that talked about penguins

00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:02,820
and this thing called Foss and so this

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,250
is this this talk is going to address a

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,480
wide variety of people so I really think

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,000
there's something in this for everyone

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,530
and I don't say that because I'm a great

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,540
speaker I say that because I've lived

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,680
this this is literally what I've gone

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,209
through over the past four years so

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,700
where do you start

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,410
whether you're you're into your career

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,479
whether you're tenured whether you're

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,460
just getting started

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:28,400
open-source is huge

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,770
and when I say open source for my

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,550
veterans here I'm talking about Foss or

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,500
open source

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm not we're not talking about finance

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,449
roles here I so be it Foss or open

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,919
source make that equivalency with me so

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:45,139
where do you start the open source

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,310
community is huge there's millions of

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:51,110
developers dozens of languages all types

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,580
of different positions and roles and

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,990
responsibilities that you can be a part

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,240
of and and this movement is is global it

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,780
stretches it ignores color it ignores

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,940
gender it ignores anything it it is one

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,430
of the most unbelievable movements that

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,130
that mankind has ever seen and it's

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,900
really spun up over the last 20-some odd

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,729
years so here's here's your first pro

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,699
tip of the day if you have a skill

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,199
there's a need and open source if you

00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:25,099
have something that you can do and do it

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,360
well there's a place for you because

00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,759
here's here's one of the biggest

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,349
misconceptions that I hear my background

00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,960
is as a systems engineer I spent almost

00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:36,440
a decade managing Windows for a few

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,419
years and and after that I was just a

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,130
pure Linux systems administrator so I

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,130
worked on a lot on Red Hat and sent to

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,409
West servers and I can tell you that

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,990
open source is not just for developers

00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:50,409
that is misconception don't let anyone

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,409
tell you otherwise

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,259
so you might be saying hey IT guy I

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,849
don't I don't have a skill I don't know

00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:03,979
how to do X but that's not really an

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:05,810
excuse anymore there are so many tools

00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,610
out there at your fingertips if you go

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,099
out onto the Internet there's there's

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,599
organizations like Linux Academy Linux

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,699
Academy has grown so much over the last

00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,250
few years because they fill a need Linux

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:20,960
Academy is an online education platform

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:25,370
that covers cloud development Linux open

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,669
source and they grow every year maybe

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,229
you don't have money for that well

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,240
there's groups like digitalocean who

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,940
hosts a huge repository of information

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,570
there's the arch linux wiki that has

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,380
tons of information about how to install

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,160
your operating

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,160
and how to work with different

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,440
applications you can search for blogs

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,830
you can search for tutorials and

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,540
walkthroughs on how to do certain tasks

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,310
listen to these talks go to the booths

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,630
figure out what people are working on

00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:01,100
and take that take that home and search

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,990
for those keywords how do I do X and I

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,690
can guarantee you will find dozens of

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:10,370
blogs and walkthroughs and people's

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:11,210
histories on how they did that thing but

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,400
you can't do this alone

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,390
you can't do this on an island so find a

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,970
Linux user group

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,490
there's lugs in almost every major city

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,410
at least here in the US I know that

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,250
there's bugs all over the world there's

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:29,090
some that are online a shameless plug

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,250
for a colleague of mine if you join Big

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,920
Daddy Linux live that is basically a

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,990
virtual luck you can log on via zoom

00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,090
client you can talk about Linux you can

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,740
share information so for those of us

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,990
that travel a lot those of us that may

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,430
not have a very active group at home

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:49,010
there are options to do so online you

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,140
showed up rosco your rock oh you showed

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,730
up so I gave you a shout out Big Daddy

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:59,600
Linux live tonight live 8:00 p.m.

shameless plug in fact if you're if you

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,310
don't have the technical experience to

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,600
get started an open source in fact one

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,730

here you can also search for boot camps

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,120
there's development boot camps there's

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,160
there's there's boot camps which are you

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,170
know four or five days of just very deep

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,600

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,169
dive in headfirst and see if you like

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,090
something so one of the best ways to

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,270
learn is not to just learn in a vacuum

00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,039
learning on learning how to write hello

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,260
world in three different languages is

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,060
great it's it's great skill it's great

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,260
achievement but you're not going to

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,970
really learn you're not really going to

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,200
commit that to memory unless you do

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,880
something yourself one of the

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,280
things to do build your own server lab

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,230
you can you can buy a desktop install a

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,690
server operating system on it call that

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,340
your lab you can spin up virtual

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,860
machines on your laptop or on your

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,290
desktop or if you're a little bit

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,390
obsessive like myself there are sites

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,930
out there like like server monkey and

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:15,030
UNIX surplus they companies will lease

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,980
brand-new hardware for three or four

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,450
years and then companies like server

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,610
monkey or UNIX surplus will buy this

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,000
hardware will refurbish it and resell it

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,090
for pennies on the dollar I just bought

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,190
a Dell r5 20 it's now sitting in a Colo

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,570
in-home it came in I installed the

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,490
operating system and dropped it off the

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,700
day before I came to self so I'm really

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,080
excited to go home and play with that if

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,740
you don't want Jack with hardware that's

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,930
find digitalocean 'la note AWS these

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,550
cloud providers actually give you very

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,950
very cheap server operating systems

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,020
where you can you can sharpen your

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,600
system administrator skills you can

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,400
install a Python environment you can

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,670
install Ruby on Rails and start doing

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,070
development they they have they have

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,630
starter credits some of the some of the

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,300
organizations that are here have

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,060
additional coupons or promo codes that

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,570
you can get so you can get some of them

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,340
offer $100 of free credit in today's day

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,030
and age you do not have an excuse to not

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,410
have a do-it-yourself project in fact I

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,150
learned this the hard way it took me

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,700
years before I actually set up a server

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,470
at home one of the problems I had was

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,270
where do I start so I have this server

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,650
it does nothing but sit there in idle

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:30,270
and bring my power bill up those of us

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,710
that have small server clusters at home

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,880
we know how that feels so here's here's

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,140
just a couple of examples that I

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,510
compiled from my own history

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,790
my first do-it-yourself project was a

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,920
sin OS 6 box on running on a piece of

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,120
hardware that was just barely better

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,220
than a than a surfer we're barely better

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,900
than a desktop and I installed a

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,850
minecraft server on it it was a great

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,850
chance to learn Linux and then have some

00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,860
fun with my family once once my

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,240
minecraft server was up and running that

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,970
wasn't enough I was hooked

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,650
I learned next cloud I learned I bought

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,170
some unified networking equipment and

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,040
they have

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,110
troller that runs on Linux let's see you

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,230
can host your own block ghost is a great

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,660
option Linux server dot IO is a friend

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,209
of the community and they have dozens

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,550
and dozens of docker containers they

00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,010
have great tutorials and great ways to

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,320
get started with tools like Plex like

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,940
next cloud like bit worden so any of

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,329
these projects would be a great starting

00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,920
place find something find a problem or a

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,100
pain point in your life and find a

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,750
technical solution for it and don't pay

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,949
don't pay a third party to do it for you

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,540
do it yourself I was able to save

00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:45,220
hundreds of dollars a year on Dropbox

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,810
and Google Drive and all these other

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,149
options because I started hosting next

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,430
cloud at home that instance is now moved

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,250
from a Linux server to a Linux container

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,699
and now is running on on my co-located

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,690
Dell server

00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,760
brannad the server was a little bit more

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,449
than my Dropbox cost but that's a topic

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,880
for another day so one of the questions

00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:10,990
I get asked quite a bit is what kind of

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,779
education do I need well forgive me I

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,209
may be a little bit cynical I am the

00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:21,940
proud owner of a master's degree it's

00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:23,199
gotten me nowhere so I heard a couple of

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,570
laps I think a few other people have

00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,079
heard this so here's here's the thing

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,449
you have to you you I won't say you have

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,980
to it's a great idea to get a degree if

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,540
you can get an associates a bachelor's

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,459
master's whatever the case may be if you

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,560
have that piece of paper you're going to

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,120
get looked at IT is one of the most

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,130
competitive one of the most cutthroat

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,959
industries out there right now why

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,180
because everything is run on computers

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,920
today you cannot brew your coffee in the

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,110
morning it seems like anymore without

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,790
some kind of a computer you can't start

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,730
your car without the computer inside

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,949
your car booting up computers are

00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,399
everywhere it's it's a tough industry to

00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:01,899
be in so finding ways to set yourself

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,579
apart is what's going to help you be

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,579
successful if you're looking to be an IT

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,620
professional I would recommend you get a

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:10,420
degree don't do it to the point where

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,850
it's crippling to your family or to your

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,529
budget but if you can afford it go for

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,029
it there's assistance programs out there

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,029
that really helps

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,850
so if if you don't have the time

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,010
commitment if you don't have the money

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,190
there's another alternative and this

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,900
one's probably better get certified find

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,080
a certification that you like and go for

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,940
it

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,800
there's a bunch of inner directory

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,960
certifications that I highly recommend

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,260
there's the a plus there's the Linux

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,180
Plus Linux Foundation has a number of

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,940
certifications so if you're just getting

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,980
started those are great basic just

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,530
ground level foundational certifications

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,920
that you can get that will help improve

00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:55,180
your marketability to to an employer

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:57,730
pro tip number two Red Hat is very very

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,620
respected in this industry why because

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,870
unlike most certifications which are

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,930
multiple choice red hat certifications

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:08,500
are hands on you literally walk in they

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:11,770
give you a broken VM they say here you

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,390
go and hand you a lab manual so a lot of

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,190
times you have to reboot into emergency

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,380
mode reset the root password and then

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,450
boot back into into into the standard

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,360
run level and then you get to setup web

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,480
servers email servers it varies from

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,810
test to test but in less than an hour

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,930
you can prove that you have the

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,570
foundational skills to run a Linux

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,460
server it's it's easy it's fun to learn

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,770
and it's hands-on for those of us that

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,830
aren't great at tests test taking I got

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,000
my CSA I missed one question because it

00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:48,520
was something that I was doing in my day

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:53,260
job every single day go to where the

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,990
puck is I hate to say it but Fortran not

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:59,490
around much anymore mainframes they have

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,320
a niche in the in the in the industry

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,740
maybe if you're just getting started

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,010
if you're just now in college may not be

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,320
a great way to go I hate to tell I hate

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,560
to I hate to tell my fellow veterans but

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,160
containerization DevOps that's where the

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,870
puck is going

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,140
that's where everything is is going to

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,330
be running on ideal there's not a day

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,640
literally when I'm working with get lab

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,320
talking on from from the sales

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,000
engineering perspective there's not a

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,110
day that goes by where I'm not talking

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,450
about kubernetes

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,130
so we have to get through the marketing

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,630
hype we have to ignore the buzzwords and

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,690
actually look at what the technology is

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,940
so if you're taking notes look at look

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,540
at cloud providers look at AWS look like

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:50,510
GCP look at Azure know that that that's

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:53,870
a look at a WMS GCP and as you're all

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,700
withholding my personal commentary look

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,020
at docker look at kubernetes I'm just

00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,030
gonna move on before I dig myself a

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,190
deeper hole look at tools like

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,690
Prometheus these are the tools moving

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,020
forward that are going to be the staple

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,420
of our industry tools like Nagios tools

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,220
likes nos all those still have their

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,720
place they're still very important and I

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,120
highly recommend you learn those tools

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,130
but if you want to if you want to get

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,710
ahead of the curve there are more

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,660
kubernetes jobs out there right now than

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,400
just about any other request in the

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,400
industry except maybe project management

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,020
so here is the biggest issue getting

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,210
involved with open source from a

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,420
professional perspective you get all

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,770
this learning you have a lab you have

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,090
maybe you were an intern somewhere

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,790
you've got a degree you've got a

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,870
certification but you're waiting tables

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:50,660
at a Waffle House across the street

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,640
where do you go from there the the big

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,460
pain point is that you have to have

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,820
experience to get experience I mean

00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,230
sadly it's it's a mean but it's true so

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,970
here's here's a couple of tips here's

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,580
some things to look for if you're not

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,680
involved in the open-source community

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,480
start now there are people all over this

00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,980
room and all over this conference that

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,020
can help you get involved with a project

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,740
with a group of people with a lugg ask

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,670
around when you get home look for

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,740
internships look for help desk positions

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,510
be a desktop technician look for a

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,089
church or not-for-profit who has a need

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,220
and fill that need get something on

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,080
paper get your foot in the door that is

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,690
your best option for me it was an

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,690
internship working at my city

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,690
municipality

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,290
so fast-forward a few years you're

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,330
working as a systems administrator

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,150
you're working on Windows and Linux you

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,500
you really just want to work on Linux

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,230
you've gone from help desk to desktop

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,320
support to either systems or networking

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,700
or database administrator and you're

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,100
looking at the next phase of your career

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,430
look at a systems engineer position look

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:04,930
at look at a systems architect position

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:06,100
the alternative now here's a caveat what

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,540
they tell you when you're going through

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,730
school when you're getting involved in

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,770
the industry is there's two tracks in

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,720
your career you can either get really

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,510
really deep so you're a systems engineer

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,490
or you're systems architect or an

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,900
enterprise level systems architect or

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,490
you go into management you get away from

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,140
the technology entirely and you push

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,560
papers and sit in meetings that's what

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,210
they tell you I guarantee you later on

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,950
in this talk we'll talk about a whole

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,780
bunch of other tracks tracks that were

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:36,340
not made clear to me and cost me years

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,750
of my career so wait a minute we've been

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,520
talking about jobs we've been talking

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:44,320
about professional this talk is about

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,710
open source so it was kind of a bait and

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,810
switch I died I admitted I apologize

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:52,300
sorry not sorry

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:56,440
so a lot of this talk is derived from my

00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:00,070
own experience I started out as a

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,680
desktop technician intern so I was using

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,290
Norton Ghost that takes a few of us back

00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,140
I was using Norton Ghost to reimage

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,690
desktops and I was going through and one

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,580
of my major jobs each day was to work on

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,800
our desktop refresh project so we're

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,310
taking old laptops and desktops imaging

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,930
new ones

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,030
dropping them off at the users desk

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,860
copying their home folder and hoping

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,170
that everything worked that's that was

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,180
about the first year of my career after

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,940
that internship was over I got to go

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,520
work a quick trip which those of us that

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,230
don't know the the awesome news of Kwik

00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,660
Trip it is the best convenience store

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,520
hands down come up here after the talk I

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:41,260
will argue you into the ground quick

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,390
trips the best so from so I graduated

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,380
college I left quick trip started

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,950
looking for a job that was the hardest

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,570
point in my entire life

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,130
to get my foot in the door I had a

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,250
bachelor's degree I had a year's

00:19:52,130 --> 00:20:00,250
internship had to try and find a job I

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:04,070
ended up as a application deployment

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,810
person I had a really awful title but

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,610
basically the developers would write

00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,070
code would put it in a war file and

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,630
would send it over to me I would then

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,490
take that war file with no knowledge of

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,040
Java and would deploy it to an

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,350
application and if it broke I had to fix

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,550
it the developers would get to go home I

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,590
got to fix try and fix their code so

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:28,100
after about a year and a half of that

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,990
I've I kind of got back into my original

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,580
plan I became a Systems Administrator I

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,870
was working on Windows doing a little

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,580
bit of desktop support and we had a

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,870
couple of Linux servers that kind of did

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,520
something special over here in the

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,410
corner we didn't really look at them or

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,480
talk at that talk with them throughout

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,460
college and and through the early years

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,680
of my career I was on and off with Linux

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,690
I always had a special place but it

00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,150
never quite was was able to become my

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:55,910
full-time job so a few years into my

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:57,230
career I I sat down my my girlfriend and

00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,090
I at the time went out to dinner and I

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,910
just my head wasn't there and I will not

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,920
forget this night I was talking to her

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,010
about work and how frustrated I was and

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,720
how miserable I was and I was like I

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,240
just I can't do this anymore

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,430
I like this Windows thing but it's less

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,530
than 10% of the servers that we run I'm

00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,720
stuck in this Windows world nothing

00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,400
wrong with Windows at the time but it

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,350
wasn't where it wasn't where I was

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,170
really excited I really liked this Linux

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,470
thing so I made a hard choice I found

00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:32,660
the job as a Linux Systems Administrator

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:35,030
just a sysadmin one really really was

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,740
getting I took a page pay cut to switch

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,750
jobs but I didn't have to manage windows

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:43,280
anymore I was able to go deeper with

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:46,040
Linux and so I moved over the next few

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,140
years I changed jobs once or twice and

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,490
and became more of a respected Systems

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,270
Administrator I kind of felt like I knew

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,060
what I was doing

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,460
you know when when I logged in I wasn't

00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:58,250
looking at the black abyss but it was a

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,300
terminal and and felt I felt comfortable

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,190
there but I still wasn't quite

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,290
I wasn't excited I wasn't happy I wasn't

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,900
fulfilled with what I was doing there

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:14,000
was still something missing so so I mean

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,620
about six years apart I had another one

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,570
of those moments and I will not forget

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,520
this night I went down to my office I

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,980
had my monitor set up my mouse and

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:28,520
keyboard on my Windows machine running

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:30,590
running Chrome how far I've come and I

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,150
literally went to Google and typed in

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,610
how to become a better systems

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,770
administrator and this is the moment

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:41,570
that changed my entire life this is six

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:43,730
years into my career all that all the

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,770
responses that came up were blogs to

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,440
follow recommendations for podcasts to

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:51,890
listen to suggestions for courses to

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,750
take do-it-yourself server projects I

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,150
came across this treasure trove of

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,250
information that I had no idea was out

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,350
there I knew we use software I knew that

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,820
there was and wasn't licenses but I

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,510
didn't understand that behind the

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,100
software was an entire movement and

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,960
dozens and dozens and dozens of projects

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,740
hundreds and hundreds and thousands of

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,910
people working together talking

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,980
developing software coming up with new

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:19,370
ideas forking those ideas coming up with

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,230
better ideas I had no idea despite being

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,210
an IT for so many years and working with

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,850
Linux often on that entire time I had no

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,590
idea that all this was out there no one

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:33,290
told me when I was going through college

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:35,870
no one said that this was a thing so

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,850
what did I stumble upon what did I

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,420
stumble upon what accelerated my career

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:44,210
it was the community I came across the

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,340
Linux action show I came across this

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:50,300
this little podcast that some of us may

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,470
know called destination Linux I came

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,880
across Linux unplugged

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,650
I started to realize that there was

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,330
communities around these podcasts I

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,190
started getting it into telegram groups

00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,690
I found out that in Kansas City and

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,790
Lawrence Kansas not too far from me

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,350
there was Linux user groups where people

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,600
actually showed up with their laptops in

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,490
person and talked about this stuff

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,590
talked about Linux talked about how to

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,270
get better it was just an amazing

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,500
epiphany and I know some of you are out

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,940
there rolling your eyes but this was a

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,250
big deal

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,740
I didn't I didn't have the opportunity

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,840
to join an open-source club in high

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,820
school that wasn't a thing where where I

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,490
grew up and it really started to

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,780
revolutionize my career I spent hundreds

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,240
of hours over the next few months

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,570
digesting every piece of content I could

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,100
look at I spent more time I spent more

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,020
time listening to podcasts than most

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,700
people were probably binge watching Game

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:44,900
of Thrones wasn't out by then whatever

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:48,080
was popular seven years ago so I tell

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,760
you I tell you my story not to brag not

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,280
to tell you that I'm better than you but

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,100
to tell you that I want the second half

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,830
of this talk to help accelerate your

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,770
careers I want to help you all get it

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,960
get involved in a community that really

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,850
changed my life I've got friends some of

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,550
which are sitting in this room that I

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,020
made through this community people that

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,760
I lean on people that I trust people

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,870
that I talk to not just for advice about

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,870
technology but about life

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:26,950
so I I was searching memes on Google I

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,490
found that one it's like yeah that's

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,809
that's got to go in the talk I didn't

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:37,030
expect it to do rail on my land I

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:38,620
thought but so here's looted to this in

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,390
the kind of the professional segments of

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,220
this talk but if you're going to work on

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,740
something you actually have to use it on

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,630
a daily basis studies have shown that

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,160
you have to have over 10,000 hours of

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,290
experience with something before you can

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,200
be considered profession or proficient

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,870
or an expert so if you're only using

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,679
Linux for an hour - at night after you

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:03,460
you spend all day working at Waffle

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,990
House then it's not going to really sink

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,590
in it's going to take a long time to get

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:12,460
that proficiency level up so instead use

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,320
the tools get another laptop dual boot

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,630
virtual machine whatever you have to do

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
start using those tools find the

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,799
proprietary tools you use on a daily

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,080
basis and swap them out for open source

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,280
ones that you can actually install and

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,179
use without paying a ransom fee a lot of

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,040
my tools were decided on based upon

00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,910
financial obligations that's why next

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,460
cloud was one of the first

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,080
do-it-yourself projects I did I was

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,270
tired of paying this I was tired of

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,650
paying someone else's store my data so I

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,960
brought it in-house I started running

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,000
next slide not only was i learning open

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,530
source not only was I becoming a better

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,330
systems administrator and being a part

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:52,360
of the community I was actually saving

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,950
money at the same time so that was a buy

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,260
saving on those subscription fees I was

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,390
actually able to start setting that

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,760
money aside and buying better equipment

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,559
buy more equipment now I've got multiple

00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,770
tablets multiple multiple computers

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:11,049
multiple servers it's it's a lot in our

00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:13,240
small and studio apartment but the next

00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,190
thing to the the site note that I'll

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,230
make on this is there's no one right

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:22,740
tool find the tool that works best for

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,740
you and use that tool and and learn it

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,250
so if you're going to become a part of

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,870
open source you have to dive into the

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,960
community that means going where the

00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,780
community is that can be on forums or

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,970
issue boards find these projects and

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,010
engage with them email the developer

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,960
tell them that hey I came across your

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,340
tool I really like it I've been using it

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,580
for XYZ I really like what you're doing

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:51,760
just interact get to know people and

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:56,590
then join Telegram groups join IRC

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,900
groups yes there's still a thing if

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,880
you're involved with if you're following

00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,350
destination Linux or the astronaut show

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,420
or or if you're if you're a fan of ubi

00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,610
ports which is a mobile operating system

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,470
that's it's trying to compete with

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,090
Android and iOS if you're a part of

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,010
these groups they likely have a telegram

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,050
group that you can join and talk to

00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,700
people and you know what we don't in

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,640
some of those groups I've been a member

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,500
of those groups for almost four years we

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,600
don't just talk about what the project

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,000
is we talk about just about anything but

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,950
it gives us a chance especially because

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,170
most of us are probably introverts and

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,180
and don't interact well with large

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,160
groups it's a great chance in a safe

00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,410
environment to connect with people over

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,350
a common thread so if it's the ask Noah

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:44,230
show and we'll talk about the show but

00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,780
that's only um just a minut percentage

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:53,200
of what we could actually talk about get

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:55,410
involved get connected and then be

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,150
patient with yourself take a year just

00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,830
absorb the community just learn just

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,050
make connections meet people try

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,990
different projects and when you feel

00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,790
comfortable start contributing back that

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,320
project that we talked about the that

00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,680
you reach out to the developer and said

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,430
hey I've been using your tool if if that

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,290
tool starts to not grow with your need

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,600
create an issue say hey I've got an idea

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm not a developer but I have this idea

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,040
I've got this feature what do you think

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,720
about doing adding XYZ to your project

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,430
it's called an enhancement request if

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,720
you come across a bug if your

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,330
application crashes while you're using

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,590
it go file a bug report I don't know how

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,179
many people will

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,220
say that there are open source advocates

00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:41,169
and then when you ask them how many bugs

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,020
that they filed they say I don't have

00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:45,429
time for that that is one of the biggest

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,830
problems that we need to solve as an

00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:50,650
open source community we need to be

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,659
contributing back create features create

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,240
bug requests if you have something that

00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:57,340
crashes and you don't know how to file a

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,380
bug report email that same developer and

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,970
go hey your application crash I'm not

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,460
sure really what to do next I want to

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,350
help I want to contribute back and if

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,600
you've got a good project if it's a good

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,330
healthy community they'll be open to

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,520
that they'll help walk you through

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:16,600
collecting the the appropriate logs and

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,820
and and filling out more than this broke

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,279
my computer instead this application

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,710
locked up my desktop and I had to reboot

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,539
to fix the issue if you can file a bug

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,659
report we can make improvements we can't

00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:30,520
fix a problem that we don't know exists

00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,350
if you're a developer great find a

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,659
project that needs a developer if you're

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:38,470
not stay tuned the next slide I've got

00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:41,230
some tips for you because the open

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,169
source community is growing it's the

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,779
development the the development cadence

00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:48,580
is getting faster and faster every day

00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:50,649
and a lot of these projects are not as

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,090
well staffed as it seems I think back to

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,610
when I was just a Systems Administrator

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,679
I thought all these applications were

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,710
built by some multi-million dollar

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,570
company that I just hadn't heard of no

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,640
they don't just come out of thin air

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,740
they don't come from some company it's a

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,960
community effort so think about think

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,000
about these two projects a lot of us

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,419
have met Simon he is the release

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,890
coordinator for an operating system

00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:17,950
variant called the bun - it's an

00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:20,500
offshoot of Ubuntu last I checked

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,990
their team had two or three official

00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,190
members an entire operating system is

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,110
being maintained by two or three people

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:31,299
and a small community of people that

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:34,320
contribute back two to three people it's

00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:38,320
a spin of a bun - so let's let's let's

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,570
zoom out a little bit open SSL open SSL

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,360
is a library that supports secure

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,090
communications for web traffic it it

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,460
handles thousands and thousands and

00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,480
thousands of web requests every day open

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,280
SSL is one of the most

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,350
key libraries when it comes to internet

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,840
traffic last I checked you know how many

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,900
people they had officially on their team

00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:02,410
ten don't you think that a project that

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,450
is that pivotal to our industry to our

00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,490
community to our friends our families

00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:12,520
our businesses would have more than ten

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:14,590
people so the common misconception I

00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,049
pointed out early on was the open

00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,780
sources about developers that's a big

00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:23,410
piece of it but that's not all of it so

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:27,250
if you're not a developer wake up pinch

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,870
yourself if you have to and let's look

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,340
at let's look at the next few slides and

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,309
here's some ideas if you're not a

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,780
developer great that's not a problem you

00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:39,309
know what you can do you can learn

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:42,130
markdown markdown is a programming

00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:43,960
language for documentation okay

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,179
programming language may be a little

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,230
heavy-handed but markdown is just

00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:52,929
basically a set of tags and symbols that

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,429
get you certain certain outputs so I

00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,100
know it's kind of hard to read on the

00:32:54,429 --> 00:33:00,970
projector but if you if you look at the

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,559
hash tag that creates a header if if you

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,929
look farther down there's an asterisk

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,549
that creates a bulleted list anyone can

00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,400
go out there and find a markdown cheat

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,990
sheet and start writing markdown

00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,200
documentation is pivotal coming up with

00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:18,640
with texts for for blogs for release

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,770
notes for for tutorials all this stuff

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,840
is very pivotal in fact I know of I know

00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,510
of a gentleman who is a school teacher I

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,710
think on the East Coast he's a school

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:31,679
teacher and he's got a predominant

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:35,890
second language I forget which it is and

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,990
he spends his evenings writing project

00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,150
documentation in his second language I

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,380
think it might be Japanese but this

00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,630
gentleman spends a lot of time

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,850
contributing to projects writing

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,919
documentation in a different language it

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,230
is a huge need and it's one that's

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,620
overlooked because open source is quote

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,910
about developers so you write some

00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,350
documentation but you've got some other

00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:00,840
skills branding

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,460
some of us went to some of us went to

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,039
the talk yesterday about marketing do's

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,990
and don'ts marketing is a huge need and

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,480
a huge problem we have so many name

00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,040
collisions we have so many graphics and

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,389
logos that look like they were made in

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,909
the 1990s because they were there's so

00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,859
much need to get clear marketing and

00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,169
clear branding around these projects

00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,849
some of these tools are some of the best

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:25,530
we've ever seen but no one's ever heard

00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:28,800
of them why because they're not properly

00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,149
promoted so if you're a graphic designer

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,310
if you're good at marketing if you're

00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:34,200
good at social media find a project who

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,030
needs that help find a project that you

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,609
use that you love and help promote it

00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:41,550
help design them a new logo help briefly

00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:44,310
help give a new face to their to their

00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:47,790
website it's a need trust me you don't

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,260
have to look very far in fact the the

00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,810
joke that was made yesterday was red hat

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,659
their logo was over 20 years old and

00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:58,470
they just now redid it to look more

00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,079
modern so maybe you got a big mouth like

00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,950
me and you like to talk you have ideas

00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,480
and you like to share them great do so

00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,490
start a Linux users group if there's not

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,230
one in your town join one if there's is

00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,240
one in your town volunteer to give a

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,500
talk find something in your past that

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,490
you're excited about and share that

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,680
information do a podcast and do

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,319
tutorials on YouTube some of the best

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,660
tools that we have are not just the

00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:26,310
product documentation alone I don't know

00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,290
how many times I've gotten used to a new

00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,960
product by looking at their YouTube

00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:35,819
tutorial and and having their there

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,490
documentation side by side go to

00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:40,680
conferences check so if you're taking

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,290
notes cure yourself check mark you've

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:47,010
already got a step done great job and

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,240
yes there there is a financial need some

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,160
of these projects only have two or three

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,900
people and they really would like to

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,369
dedicate their full effort to their

00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,319
projects some of them are very

00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:56,760
passionate some of them live below the

00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,310
poverty level because they are so

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,050
passionate about their project find a

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,540
way to give back there's tools out there

00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,160
and projects are getting better we're

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,420
working on this and in community

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,849
projects are getting better about

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,000
actually projects are getting better

00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:14,400
about actually having donate donate

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,830
and links on their pages we're still we

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,660
there's still so many more valuable

00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,070
projects out there that could use at

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,470
hand that could get new life breathed

00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:24,230
into them if the development if the core

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,190
developers weren't so dependent upon

00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:30,390
outside outside jobs outside

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,830
responsibilities and I don't know how

00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,720
many developers I talked to are trying

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,430
to make ends meet by doing overeats runs

00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,550
and then developing their application

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:42,330
afterwards go to patreon go to Libre pay

00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:44,250
go to GoFundMe these tools have projects

00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,470
listed on them that you can donate back

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,360
to it doesn't have to be a ton of money

00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,700
but if everybody goes out and picks one

00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,930
project and donates $5 a month I mean

00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,640
just with the number of people in this

00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:57,210
room we could make a huge difference for

00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,250
the price of one latte a month then

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,410
there's tools like M elementary OS they

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,030
recently recently has been a couple of

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,830
years but a couple of years ago they

00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,750
started this interesting initiative to

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,910
where if you download an application out

00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,250
of their store you get an option to

00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:14,070
donate to that product to that project

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,050
you get prompted to you can put in zero

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,030
or you can put in a value you can I

00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,580
think they've even added functionality

00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,890
to add in a recurring donation but this

00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,980
is just a small way how many of us go on

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,570
and and download some some game that's a

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,640
clone of six other games that we've

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,230
played and will drop $4.99 on that game

00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,200
and not give it a second thought but

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:36,030
then we go and download a a notetaking

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,100
application that we use every single day

00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,340
for home for our job for a shopping list

00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,830
for our kids birthday present list and

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:49,320
we look at that and go I'm not donating

00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:50,220
to that a little bit goes a long way so

00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,050
one of the other things that I would

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,110
tell you is to take opportunities as

00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:58,110
they come be patient this community gets

00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,960
burned all the time people will come in

00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,730
will stir up this big fuss they're

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,930
entitled because they're used to paying

00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,590
for software and getting an

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,570
enterprise-grade

00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,850
application that's not open source

00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,650
that's not how this works this is a

00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:14,400
community it's an it's an initiative

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,780
it's a it's a movement so you can't come

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,920
in and just expect that everything's

00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,530
going to be handed to you on a silver

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,660
platter that's what Mac OS is for that's

00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,069
how Apple makes their money they they

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:28,039
sell you at an exorbitant amount

00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:29,059
and experience what's great about what's

00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,490
great about the open source community

00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:33,230
and Linux you get to build your own and

00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:36,079
what does that give you why is that

00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,510
important you you get more value you

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,369
feel more connected to the tools you're

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:44,869
you're using you get connected to a

00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:46,520
brilliant group of people you can either

00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:50,270
use a tool or you can be a part of

00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,039
something but it takes time to make

00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,960
connections to earn trust you're not

00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:56,059
just gonna show up day one and be handed

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,670
a project well you might wouldn't we

00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:01,220
need the help but it's but be patient

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,170
try different roles be a release

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,640
coordinator for a project be a social

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,530
media coordinator preferred for a

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,930
different project after a while try your

00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:11,829
hand at development there's there are

00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:15,380
first time there's first time committer

00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:17,660
tags on a lot of projects that are bugs

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,670
that the developer feels like should be

00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,710
fairly easy to fix these are great

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,510
low-hanging fruit to go out and try try

00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,970
your hand at a project trust me the

00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,740
first time you make a pull request it's

00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,359
kind of nerve-wracking and you sit there

00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,069
and refresh the page over and over and

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,660
over again wondering if the developer is

00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:35,299
looking at your at your request and your

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:43,849
code change going where does this guy

00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:47,150
learn to code fisher-price so it takes

00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:48,589
time I've been on my journey I've been

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,010
on my open-source journey for over four

00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,329
years now

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,130
I spent about a year and a half just

00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,470
learning trying out different distros

00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:58,160
hopping from one to the other absorbing

00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:59,569
podcasts meeting people and it really

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,039
started to change my career because

00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,589
after a few years as a systems

00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:07,430
administrator I had the connections and

00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:10,160
the interest in the community to to

00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,380
change my career I realized that I was

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,270
missing the people aspect and now I'm

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,650
working at git lab and this isn't this

00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,760
isn't a sales pitch forget lab I'm not

00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,710
going to ask you to take your wallets

00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,210
out I've been accused of that before so

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,589
disclaimer this is not a sales pitch

00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:26,359
this is me talking from my heart so I'm

00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,829
working for get lab now as a Solutions

00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,170
Architect and a lot of what my job

00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:32,180
entails is getting to know customers I

00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,700
work in the mid market space so you know

00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,690
figure a thousand people in a company or

00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,059
so

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,990
and so I'm I get to meet customers I get

00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,250
to talk to them about their

00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,480
infrastructure I get to talk to them

00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,549
about their application what they're

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,230
trying to do I get to connect with them

00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:47,720
on a human level and learn what they're

00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,690
passionate about and go hey that's

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,910
really cool I would love to see that

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,010
I've got I've got this tool that I would

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,599
love to talk to you about yeah it's

00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,280
gonna cost your company some money but

00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,839
it's going to be worth it because it's

00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,069
going to fix your work-life balance it's

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,720
going to help your company iterate

00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:06,020
faster it's going to help you make

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,970
changes and then I cannot tell you and

00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,680
the reason why I got this talk and why I

00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,599
was really excited when it was when it

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,369
was accepted is because this is so near

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,750
and dear to my heart because I just went

00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:17,720
through this over the past five years

00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:21,049
I'm getting to live this now and so can

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,089
all of you I get to connect customers I

00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:24,829
get to I get to change the way they do

00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:26,900
business I get to change their lives in

00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:28,400
a way because I don't know if there's

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,720
any other systems administrators out

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,369
there but I cannot tell you how many

00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,869
sleepless nights I've had because I've

00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:35,630
get I get that phone call at 2:00 a.m.

00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,849
to fix some server that no one cares

00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:41,329
about but has to be up by 8:00 a.m. on

00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:43,220
Monday morning because it's not being

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,410
well taken care of that leads to burnout

00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,720
that leaves sleepless nights that leaves

00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:51,849
two families being torn apart that leads

00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:54,859
to people missing events with their kids

00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:56,630
we in this community with our technology

00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:59,930
with our community with the people in

00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:02,289
this group we can change things I cannot

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,750
tell you how much my life has changed

00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:07,460
because of the avalanche of changes that

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,940
have come with becoming part of this

00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,670
community

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:13,130
I've lost ton of weight I'm in better

00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,690
shape I'm learning new technologies I'm

00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,359
in a position that's not only engaging

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,460
me technically but also socially so I'm

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,000
feeling better I'm more confident than

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:25,970
I've ever been all because I got it

00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,890
plugged in to the fullest extent of what

00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:32,420
I can do with this community so if

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,559
you've been in IT for a while or if

00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,079
you've been in the community for a while

00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:38,359
and you sat through this talk thank you

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,529
very much I hope that this this has

00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:41,359
given you an idea of something you're

00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:45,079
not doing but I do have a word of

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,420
warning there's a lot of folks coming

00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,220
into the into into open source there are

00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,960
a lot of new faces there

00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,820
so many people that have been burned by

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,130
windows there are so many people that it

00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:58,250
can't afford to replace their entire

00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,990
line of Mac hardware there there are

00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,940
people out there that are realizing that

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,380
this community exists there are people

00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,560
that are realizing that there's so much

00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:09,050
freedom and protection of data and

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,540
personal privacy and so many advantages

00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:14,119
to being a part of our community

00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:18,080
if you're a veteran I would ask you

00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:21,530
don't be a jerk I would beg you don't

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,830
rage on people on telegram or on IRC

00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:27,050
just because you're this this ambiguous

00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:29,030
figure that this is just a username on a

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,740
website I cannot tell you how many

00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,510
developers I've heard over the past few

00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,760
years walk away because they're tired of

00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,490
all the garbage I cannot tell you how

00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,440
many people tried Linux for a few weeks

00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,150
tried open-source for a few weeks and

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,650
then went right back to whatever

00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,900
platform they were on because the

00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:47,359
community was harsh now don't get me

00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,010
wrong for the most part people that are

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,230
entering this community have had a great

00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,510
experience but some people haven't and

00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,240
will probably never see them come into

00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,550
our lugs again so if you if you are a

00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,010
veteran remember that you were once new

00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,750
to this community to remember that one

00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:06,550
time you didn't know how to make a pull

00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:11,150
request RTFM is not an acceptable answer

00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:13,609
help walk them through that process RTFM

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:16,940
only makes people more angry instead

00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,650
help them see how to fix their issue and

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,089
then walk them through how they could

00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,190
have troubleshooted it themselves I

00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:24,410
cannot tell you how many how frustrating

00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:27,920
it is to go and look at Stack Exchange

00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,300
and try and learn what someone else did

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,680
only to realize that that post was

00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,089
actually from five years ago in the

00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,400
libraries that are supporting the

00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,750
application aren't even the same anymore

00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,950
sometimes you just need a hand sometimes

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,510
you just need someone to walk you

00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,510
through the process once or twice and

00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,580
then guess what you've given them a

00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:45,680
better experience you fix their problem

00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,960
you've ease their pain and if that

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,190
happens a couple of times then they're

00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,690
going to go out and do the exact same

00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,270
thing that's why I'm on the stage

00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,820
because people in this community people

00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:58,730
like know what you live people like like

00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,800
Rocco and ZEB who are who are here to

00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,660
throw tomatoes I mean at the Q&A session

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,450
people like that

00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,820
we're there in my corner when ia was new

00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,940
to this community so if we can do the

00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,830
same for a hundred more people and we

00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,650
fill this room up next year when we

00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:17,210
revisit this talk because new people

00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,140
have come in new people want to be a

00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,820
part of this community

00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,620
our community is going to grow we're not

00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,570
going to lose valuable projects and

00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,360
prominent valuable developers to burnout

00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:29,240
and too personal depression or personal

00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:34,370
loss because we are there to help build

00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:36,560
a better community now I know I kind of

00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:38,660
got into my conclusion but I did have a

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,420
minor note the distro Wars by the way

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,610
are over the desktop Wars they're over I

00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,720
hate to tell you genome and plasma they

00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,220
actually work together they have a

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,400
conference every year now where they

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:53,720
collaborate on ideas so that was kind of

00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,000
part of the RTFM part but help new

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,630
people come in find someone to mentor

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,340
you and then find someone to mentor use

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,100
the buddy system use these communities

00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,690
let's build a better oh my gosh I almost

00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,050
said let's build a better tomorrow I

00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,240
will not be that cliched I take that

00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:18,560
statement back let's rewind the video

00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:23,750
and I'm not going to say that I think on

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:26,510
that note I'm just gonna move but but

00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,760
seriously the cliches and the personal

00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:31,910
soapbox aside we're better together as a

00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,830
community companies that build these

00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,680
walls walled gardens are in for a rude

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,110
awakening the open source community is

00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,150
where it's at

00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:44,810
so because I like to practice what I

00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:47,360
preach I'm I'm I ran and built this

00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:52,100
presentation on my system76 gala GoPro

00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:54,860
it's using Arch Linux by the way I'm

00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:57,560
using the LibreOffice Firefox and get

00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,230
lab to manage distributing this these

00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,780
slides so I'm not standing up here with

00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:05,240
a MacBook or an iPad so I wouldn't stand

00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,070
up here and tell you and tell you that

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,950
you should use a Linux while I'm well

00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:12,170
I'm using an iPad in fact my talk is

00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,790
open-source this is something I want to

00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,110
share with people and if anyone in this

00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,720
room found it valuable

00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:20,910
go go to my gate lab repo download this

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,680
talk and look through the slides because

00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,990
I've listed out a lot of the tools that

00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,580
I talked about tools like digitalocean

00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,430
tools like Linux Academy tools like

00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,810
telegram IRC groups podcasts and I would

00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,910
like to iterate on this I would like

00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,040
this talk to be given all over the place

00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,860
by as many people as possible because I

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,300
feel like this is a foundational

00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:42,900
foundational topic that people just

00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:45,180
assume people know maybe it's just me I

00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,580
didn't it took me seven years into my

00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:49,290
career before I finally figured out that

00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,700
there was more to my career than just

00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:53,190
the servers that were in the in the

00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:56,250
server closet behind me I welcome your

00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:58,560
feedback this is open source please give

00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,480
me feedback make changes help me improve

00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,220
this I'm trying to give this talk a few

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,530
other places so if you can give me your

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,620
feedback how to make it better how to

00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:09,270
how to at least not make it worse if

00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,490
there's resources I forgot about if

00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:15,510
there's do DIY projects that I didn't

00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:19,260
think of please please please send send

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:22,110
me feedback so I thank you very very

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,630
much for your time we've got it we've

00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:26,520
got about 12 minutes or so I would

00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:38,300
welcome any questions or conversation

00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:38,300
that you might have lap yes sir get lab

00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:44,220
no no get Lamba is is completely

00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:48,090
independent we're planning on IP owing

00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:52,800
next year we were developed by a couple

00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:55,110
of folks who were were remote and they

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,760
actually came together because git lab

00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,690
was originally just a self-hosted get

00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,770
repository it was open sourced and

00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:03,150
because it was a great project it

00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,130
attracted more people to it

00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,690
and then after about two or three years

00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,330
of just being an open source project

00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,190
they formed a company around it because

00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,930
the the lead developers kind of wanted

00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:16,430
to eat so they formed a company they

00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:19,590
started selling insulation services and

00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:21,690
then expanded to a support model similar

00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,220
to Red Hat but their application worked

00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,540
really really well so people would use

00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,990
support once or twice and then never

00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,470
again

00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:29,310
and so now git lab is an open core model

00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,200
where

00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:33,480
about 90% of the code base is open

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,350
source and the other 10% are paid

00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:41,630
premium features and includes 24-hour

00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:44,430
support and in different levels of

00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:47,700
features on either get lab comm which is

00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:50,340
a solution or on on self on a self

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:53,310
hosted instance so get labs completely

00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,710
independent it's a single it's a single

00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:58,170
tool for for the entire DevOps lifecycle

00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:01,770
so instead of managing github JIRA

00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:03,420
Jenkins sonar cube and however many

00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,070
other products I'm not thinking of off

00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,500
the top my head you can install git lab

00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,660
and it's one interface is one tool to to

00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,520
handle all of that

00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,230
so not trying to sell anything I'm not

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,850
asking for your wallets but yeah git lab

00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,260
is completely independent of github

00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:20,930
they're they're actually a competitor of

00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:24,840
ours yet lab is a hundred percent remote

00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:26,490
we don't have an office I'm based out of

00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,640
Kansas City there's two or three people

00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:32,400
from Charlotte there's actually two of

00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,270
their people here from get lab and

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:39,390
they've both given talks but yeah global

00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:42,480
and six almost sixty companies are sixty

00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:46,370
countries I'm gonna be more than happy

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,370
to talk about good lap after afterwards

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,430
any other questions or comments or

00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:52,890
feedback please I know I throw a lot of

00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:57,440
information at you and I really really

00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,440
sincerely hope it was valuable yes sir

00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:08,540
okay so the question was we talked about

00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:10,400
tools for learning and the question was

00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:14,990
is is there anything I would recommend

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,060
specifically for kubernetes yes Linux

00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,660
Academy has a number of great tools and

00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,830
then there is a site that actually does

00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,170
walkthroughs

00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:26,300
I know Red Hat has a bunch of stuff I

00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:29,660
know open shifts on there but kubernetes

00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,010
also has one I could probably look it up

00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,380
really quick with a Google search but

00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,170
it's it's not coming to me you on one

00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,580
side it basically gives you step-by-step

00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,230
what you're doing and gives you the

00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,900
exact command and then on the right is a

00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,340
live terminal and that's so you can

00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,630
basically copy and paste the commands

00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,250
and step through the process one at a

00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:47,690
time and it's it's very succinct it's a

00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,410
great way to just get in and get started

00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:53,330
but the name is escaping me right now

00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:55,390
come up after we're done and I will

00:51:53,330 --> 00:52:11,660
Google search that for you real quick

00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:14,180
yes sir okay yeah that's that's great

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,370
that's that's great feedback so the the

00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,320
idea was if you want to learn markdown

00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:20,630
and you still want a DIY project to host

00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,540
yourself there's Cody MD right

00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:25,580
there's Cody MD you can go down you can

00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,050
go online search Cody MD it's it's a

00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,560
markdown editor it's basically an online

00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:32,630
notebook it's open source it's it's got

00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,580
a docker container it's it's I haven't

00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:36,640
used it myself but I've talked to a lot

00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,990
of people and I need to give it a try

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,520
but great feedback in fact I might try

00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,070
and add that one into into the talk as

00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,220
well any other any other questions or

00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,220
feedback

00:52:46,510 --> 00:53:03,280
Cody MD it's kod I OC oti yeah kod I is

00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:03,280
a media media server so co di MD Rocco

00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:18,410
okay and so the question was are there

00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,950
more local resources as you can make use

00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:23,810
of are you talking about from from an

00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:28,490
employment perspective or form okay so

00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:29,600
employment so so the question was what

00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,510
other resources would you suggest

00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,550
looking for for employment resources and

00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:37,280
so for getting started I would recommend

00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:39,560
looking for internships a lot of times

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,480
colleges will have will have bulletin

00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,150
boards or sometimes they even have their

00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,910
own their own staff some other things

00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,710
you might consider are job boards

00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,900
I don't think Craigslist really does

00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:54,800
that anymore but then there's things

00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:56,840
like there's careerbuilder.com there's

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,570
monster.com so your traditional job

00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,600
boards I don't really recommend playing

00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,920
the recruiter route but sometimes

00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,510
sometimes you need to know somebody who

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,020
knows people to kind of get connected

00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:12,500
and start building your own Network so

00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:15,380
job boards local recruiters going to

00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,640
local schools and sometimes sometimes

00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,130
they have interns sometimes they're just

00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,420
looking for help

00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,730
not-for-profits are not for profits

00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,860
charities churches those are those are

00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,230
great options because those are usually

00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,480
people that don't have a lot of lot of

00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,370
budget to spend and so they're all

00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,990
usually looking for volunteers and it's

00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:35,120
usually kind of an accepted thing that

00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:37,700
if you're volunteering your time then

00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,920
they kind of take your your expertise

00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,210
with a grain of salt so if they're if

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,650
you're just an intern for that they're

00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:46,630
not going to expect you to build a ten

00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:49,850
thousand dollar infrastructure overnight

00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:52,310
but if the that's kind of the the list

00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,810
that I had in my notes if anyone else

00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:56,180
has any recommendations of where they

00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:58,520
found a job or where they've they found

00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,020
a starter job I would love to hear it

00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,280
because like I said that's something I'd

00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:05,260
like to include in the talk going

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,260
forward question in the back

00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:40,240
okay yeah that's that's a great feedback

00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:44,860
so so the feedback was that this woman

00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:47,620
started a job working and and with

00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:50,080
safety team and basically doing jobs

00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,940
that weren't IT related but he got some

00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,770
time in with the company and he showed

00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,620
himself to be a dependable employee and

00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:59,500
and as his as his time has gone on he

00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,540
has been able to move into the IT

00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,650
department within that same company and

00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,900
that's that's great

00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:09,120
that's a great situation that's a great

00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:09,120
approach and I didn't even occur to me

00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,090
right so Tyler up here in front works

00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,030
for Amazon he started out in the

00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,560
warehouse he does more IT support now so

00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,480
that's a great option so if you're not

00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,120
working in IT right now but you've been

00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,560
learning it and you enjoy it

00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,300
talk to your existing employers see if

00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,520
they have any needs most companies would

00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,560
love to hire internally and do a

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,120
transfer to a different apartment then

00:56:29,560 --> 00:57:23,860
have to go out onto the street and find

00:56:31,120 --> 00:57:26,800
somebody completely new right that

00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:29,110
that's amazing feedback so so his point

00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,450
was and just mostly for this for the

00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:33,670
stream and the recording but his point

00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:35,440
was that a lot of people that you see

00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,000
that are very successful in IT they

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,280
started out as what I'd call the

00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,600
datacenter monkey so this is a person

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,270
who carries a server throws it in the

00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,250
rack plug the cables hit power and then

00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,720
they go go back to their desk they close

00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,490
out their ticket and then the systems

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,980
engineer actually takes the work

00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,180
takes the the ticket and builds out the

00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,550
server and that kind of thing so you

00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,380
start out racking and second servers a

00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,210
lot of my first jobs involved cleaning

00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:02,140
out the data center which was which

00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:05,590
other people thought was closet so so

00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,540
working for telcos and collocations are

00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:09,160
usually a great way to get introduced to

00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:11,200
the environment it's a great way to see

00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,540
if it's something that you'll enjoy it's

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,880
a great way to learn from from from

00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,880
professionals people that have just a

00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:23,410
little bit more experience than you so

00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:30,130
data centers colocation colocation

00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:31,540
locations and and and telcos colos so

00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:33,640
yeah great great feedback that's not

00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,110
something I considered so I've got about

00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:39,700
a minute so any other any other

00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:41,410
