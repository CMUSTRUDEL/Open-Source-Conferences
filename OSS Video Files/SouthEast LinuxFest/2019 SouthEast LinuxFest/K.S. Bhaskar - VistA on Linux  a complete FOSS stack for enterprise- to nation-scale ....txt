Developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs, VistA is a mature, complete healthcare information system that is used throughout the VA as well as the Indian Health Services (part of the Dept. of Health & Human Services). In the public domain by virtue of the Freedom of Information Act, VistA on Linux provides a complete free / open source software stack that anyone can use, and indeed it is used around the world in primary care practices, at least one nation-scale electronic health record system (Jordan's Hakeem project) and at all sizes of institutions in-between. On a very local note, using VistA has saved North Carolina taxpayers a considerable amount of money. The speaker will introduce you to the VistA FOSS stack, and discuss this software gem that all of us as taxpayers have paid for.
