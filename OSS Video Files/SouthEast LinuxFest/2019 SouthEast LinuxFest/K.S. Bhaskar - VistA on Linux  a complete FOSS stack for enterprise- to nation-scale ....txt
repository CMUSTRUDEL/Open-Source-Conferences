Title: K.S. Bhaskar - VistA on Linux  a complete FOSS stack for enterprise- to nation-scale ...
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
Developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs, VistA is a mature, complete healthcare information system that is used throughout the VA as well as the Indian Health Services (part of the Dept. of Health & Human Services). In the public domain by virtue of the Freedom of Information Act, VistA on Linux provides a complete free / open source software stack that anyone can use, and indeed it is used around the world in primary care practices, at least one nation-scale electronic health record system (Jordan's Hakeem project) and at all sizes of institutions in-between. On a very local note, using VistA has saved North Carolina taxpayers a considerable amount of money. The speaker will introduce you to the VistA FOSS stack, and discuss this software gem that all of us as taxpayers have paid for.

so short enough he's on at nine o'clock

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,180
tomorrow morning but the synopsis of

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,280
both of my talks got merged into the

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,200
synopsis with this store so if you

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,790
actually read it you'd say no this

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,030
doesn't make sense it's kind of like you

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:20,150
know talking about you know chocolate

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:23,730
and dill pickles in the same recipe so

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:27,510
so I'm going to talk about Vista on

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,090
Linux which is a complete free and open

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,790
source tag for electronic health records

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,360
and I'm not going to say anything about

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,829
go out of curiosity how many people here

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,579
get health care from the VA okay great

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,559
so you know if you had health care in

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,780
the VA part of your medical records to

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,340
be here actually in a university system

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,860
and if as part of your service you ever

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,520
got health care in the Department of

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,090
Defense

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,129
there also is in a in a variant of the

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,550
the Vista system again thank you for

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,550
your service

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:13,480
so this is just the obligatory marketing

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,940
slide I work for a company called you're

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,060
a DB and we're basically a

00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,120
high-performance

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,150
open source no SQL database engine and

00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,950
it's used in very large the codebase

00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,020
under a different brand name is used in

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,550
some very large banking systems it's

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,580
also used in very large electronic

00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,340
health record systems and we're

00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,800
basically taking it to other markets and

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,140
applications in a clone zone all the way

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,310
from a raspberry pi up to a very

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,860
high-end nation scale system and because

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,619
of the nature of the applications we run

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,630
on our tag line is basically rock-solid

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,630
lightening for secure pick any three

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:03,899
okay so who knows this place that's why

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,090
I asked about anyone from North Carolina

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:13,870
okay you're from North Carolina where is

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:16,600
this place okay so it's there's a this

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,459
is Central Regional Hospital from a town

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,530
called Butner North Carolina it's about

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:24,280
a half-hour north of Raleigh and it is a

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,250
facility of the North Carolina

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,450
Department of Health and Human Services

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:34,330
it is a mental health inpatient hospital

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,989
and this means that patients are often

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:41,380
there for many years in some cases still

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:43,239
for the rest of their lives and and

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,480
again it's operated by the state of

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,480
North Carolina

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:56,769
so they implemented a complete open

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:58,510
source stack Avesta on linux and they

00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:59,640
say if the North Carolina tax payers

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,900
millions of dollars

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,060
perhaps tens of millions again I don't

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,090
know the exact prices that people

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,220
actually pay for these systems but they

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,940
took the open source stack they

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,669
implemented it themselves and the result

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,489
was that North Carolina taxpayers are

00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:20,140
now millions of dollars better off than

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,180
they would have been otherwise

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,150
of course part of the challenge and all

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,620
of this is that it's very hard to show

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,710
money saved it's easy to show money

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,560
spent it's you know just like in health

00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,050
care it's very easy to show that you

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,060
spent money and caring for someone with

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,380
measles you don't really talk so much

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,300
about you know preventing it by

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,340
immunization so immunizations get the

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:51,520
short end of the stick okay so let me

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,709
talk a little bit about what is Vista so

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,570
it's developed by the Department of

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,870
Veterans Affairs I'll talk a little bit

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:02,220
in a few minutes about the history and

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,870
it's used throughout the VA system and

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,160
it's a it's a health care information

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,180
system so it's not just for clinical

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,030
applications it doesn't just keep track

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,820
of all of you your clinical care but it

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,829
also does inventory management it does

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:23,740
scheduling it does many things and

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:27,430
there's actually a book called the best

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,490
care anywhere by Philip Longman and the

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,530
interesting story is he actually was

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,820
commissioned by the so way back when if

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,210
you remember there was a movie born on

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:40,060
the fourth of July by yeah I forget who

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,790
it was but they had this movie in it you

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,150
know sort of depicted the V is sort of

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,919
being the dirty place and so on so the

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,350
author was actually commissioned by

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,060
either Forbes or fortune to write an

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,510
article about how bad things were at the

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,650
VA he went into his research came back

00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,210
and told them you don't really have a

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,760
story unless you want the story and how

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,410
good things are about to be so they paid

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,210
him his retainer and let him go because

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,830
it was not news to write about things

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,860
that are going well so he wrote a book

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:13,810
instead and and the book argues that

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,240
essentially the best care in the United

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,390
States is actually delivered by the VA

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,210
system now you know you've probably seen

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,070
the news about facilities in Phoenix and

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,860
elsewhere where patients died because

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,110
they couldn't get scheduled in time that

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,789
was sort of very much of a of a local

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,150
issue where they are the wrong

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,540
incentives in place in some cases for

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,130
to show you know shorty short waiting

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,070
times and so on but if you look overall

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,770
at the statistics veterans as a

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,870
population are sicker than the

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,730
population as a whole because you are

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,600
entitled to care from the VA for service

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:55,560
related conditions right so if you so

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,080
therefore they have people who have you

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,150
know Agent Orange Agent Orange cause

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,160
cancer they've had people who have you

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,470
know PTSD all kinds of symptoms like

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,730
that that they treat so the people they

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,030
treat are actually sicker than the

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,380
population as a whole but their costs

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,140
have actually been going up less than

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,900
the population as a whole and if you

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,540
look at a number of metrics they

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,480
actually have better metrics and better

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,290
outcomes then the commercial healthcare

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,270
system and so that's what the book is

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,670
about so it's definitely well worth a

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,990
read it's a few years of old now I would

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,970
say I think it's probably the latest

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:37,520
edition was maybe five or six years old

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,520
but it's definitely worth taking a look

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,830
now the same system is used not just in

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,830
the Department of Veterans Affairs but

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,200
also you know their branches of the

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,560
federal government so the Department of

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,440
Defense uses it there is a system called

00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,930
CHCs which they deployed in the 1990s

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:04,650
and they're trying hard to replace it so

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,860
here's the sad story about CHCs the

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,900
Department of Defense obviously has got

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,810
health care needs that the VA doesn't

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,550
have so the Department of Defense has

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,650
they've gotta do pediatrics right

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,630
because if you're a service member

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,570
serving on a base you have kids they

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,670
provide care the Department of Defense

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,000
needs OB kind right so there are no

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,710
pediatric veterans until recently

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,690
against pregnancy was not really a cause

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:34,320
of a is a service related condition

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:37,700
because back in the day pretty much all

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,700
veterans were male sir

00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:52,879
okay so well things have changed enough

00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,679
but I'm talking about the mid-1990s and

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,089
so the Department of Defense had a few

00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,519
requirements that were not part of the

00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:02,309
VA system they could have had the VA

00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,899
system for free and for a small

00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:06,209
investment in programming they could

00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,279
have programmed the additional

00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,319
functionality that was needed well what

00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,909
happened was they did it in the typical

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,059
Department of Defense style they put out

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,360
a procurement contract they actually had

00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:19,679
three people so they had this bake-off

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,860
between three vendors to see who could

00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:24,779
provide the you know the best solution

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,939
at the lowest price well there were

00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,300
three vendors one of them happened to be

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,639
a company that was then called SAIC I

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,229
don't know what their name is today so

00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,229
they actually took Vista from the VA

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,669
under the Freedom of Information Act so

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,949
under the Freedom of Information Act you

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,149
can get Vista so they got Vista under

00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,159
the Freedom of Information Act

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:47,160
they added some functionality for the

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,029
bake-off and at about 30% of the cost of

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,399
the next bidder

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,740
they demonstrated something like 90% of

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,800
the required functionality so naturally

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,920
they got the contract and you know made

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,639
sense in a certain twisted way and so

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,649
for tens of millions of dollars they

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,019
sold the system to the Department of

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,279
Defense the same system implemented in

00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,709
the Department of Defense is a

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,120
proprietary system not an open-source

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:18,029
system but there you go that's how you

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,740
know people in DoD their electronic

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,040
health record said in a variant Avista

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,809
yes mister in the VA the people in the

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,370
Indian Health Service which is part of

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,800
the Department of Health and Human

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,870
Services they did it the right way they

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,629
took mister from the ve under the

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,209
Freedom of Information Act and again

00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:39,569
they had some unique requirements that

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:43,019
the VA didn't have for example many of

00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:44,839
the let's say the Indian nations and

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,189
reservations and locations are remote

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,930
you literally don't have any in it

00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:50,470
didn't have any networking so they had

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,320
to run the system on a PC

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,850
central network facility they also

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,040
needed things like pediatric growth

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,700
charts and all of the things that you

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,850
know Pediatrics needs so they took the

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,910
Freedom of Information Act Vista they

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,620
added to it and they deployed it now

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,660
their system is not a hundred percent

00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,010
compatible with Vista but they kind of

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,270
knew what they were doing because they

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,730
said here are the places where we need

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,430
to make changes but they did it the

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:24,370
right way compared to the Department of

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:27,670
Defense it's also been adopted in a

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,160
number of states so for example I talked

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,370
about North Carolina so they did it the

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,440
right way by using a a free and open

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,940
source stack there are others like New

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,200
York and Tennessee the state of Mental

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,880
Health in New York state of mental

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,220
health the departs re Department in

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,680
mental health in New York Department of

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,280
Mental Health in Tennessee the Oklahoma

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,190
State Veterans homes so they are all run

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,570
variants a vista except for North

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,430
Carolina the others are actually

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,830
deploying Vista even the Vista they are

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,510
using as the free and open source the

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,520
sorry for your Vista which is in the

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,790
public domain they're actually deploying

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,470
it on a proprietary stack whereas North

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:12,000
Carolina has actually deployed it on a

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:14,350
on an open source stack and we have

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,270
hospitals and clinics in the United

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,460
States outside of the government system

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,430
that have deployed it so the most

00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,370
notable example is Oroville hospital in

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,990
northern california so last year that

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,670
party california was in the news for all

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,990
of the wildfires they didn't actually

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,510
get to or reveal but they were other

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,030
parts that and by the way if you ever

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,520
get to visit it's the site of the

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,440
tallest earthworks dam in the United

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,690
States so this is huge dam you go on one

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,520
side you see decreasing on the side it

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,710
just looks like the side of a hill but

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,250
it's actually a dam with a lake behind

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,370
it so so they deployed they took Vista

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,250
from the VA they deployed it and they

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,750
deploying it in an open source stack and

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,430
by the way it's deployable also at the

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,550
level of the family physician although

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,650
that requires some expertise that most

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,370
family physicians don't have I mean I

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,110
would rather probably have my physician

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,230
focusing on healthcare rather than

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:13,519
focusing on you know implementing

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:16,459
computer systems well so in this case it

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,889
turns out that this is a physician who

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:21,529
he and his wife of a practice in rural

00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,269
Tennessee his background is electrical

00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,059
engineering and you know he always

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,620
enjoys programming so I guess he worked

00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:29,809
out a deal with his wife where I think

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,970
she sees patients most of the time he

00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:33,620
sees patients part-time and maintains

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:41,779
the system part-time and he also does

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:44,629
some consulting so it's possible so and

00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,089
actually internationally it's used in a

00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,949
number of countries the most noteworthy

00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,949
is Jordan

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:53,660
so in Jordan they actually have to put

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:57,879
things in perspective Jordan is about

00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,730
the area and population of Indiana

00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:04,040
Tennessee or Kentucky

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,809
they have three healthcare systems not

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,209
sort of a fourth one but they have three

00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:10,009
healthcare systems so one is the

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:12,620
Ministry of Health System so most

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,749
Jordanians who are not members of the

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,809
services get they care in the ministry

00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:19,879
Health System we have the royal medical

00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:22,370
services which are primarily for the

00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,589
military health system and then they

00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,990
have the the private health care system

00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:28,610
and then the the fourth one is they have

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,559
a system for the Royal High Court for

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,059
the royal family and that's a very small

00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,850
system that's completely separate from

00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:36,949
anything else so they've actually taken

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,069
Vista from the Department of Veterans

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:44,809
Affairs they're deploying it on an open

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:47,269
source stack they actually have a so

00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,679
they have one system for for the

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:52,129
Ministry of Health another system for

00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,990
the royal medical services and they

00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,670
don't use the same database because they

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,139
are concerned about the role medical

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,559
services obviously more concerned about

00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,269
things like security and so on but they

00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,209
actually are deploying it and they are

00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:07,279
actually getting benefits from which the

00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,079
VA also gets by the way so the VA can

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,449
because of the fact that they have all

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,279
of these medical records they can now

00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,639
look at it and say if I have a patient

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,299
with condition X let's say

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,519
I I guess excessive cholesterol what's

00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,910
the best starting to start this patient

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,199
on and they can do these kinds of

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,119
analytics because they have this huge

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,329
database and they can see if this

00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,860
patient is male and Caucasian well this

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,850
is the statin we want to start or if it

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,379
happens to be female and

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,579
african-american this is the statin we

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:39,769
want to start on you know if it's

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:42,170
asian-american so they can do all of

00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,089
this kind of analysis and they can do

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,980
this based on outcomes and cost

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,939
well the jordanians are getting the

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,670
benefit of all of that and and then it's

00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:54,889
been deployed and some sites in India as

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,949
well including one Hospital which is the

00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,319
first in Asia to be certified at the

00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,459
hems analytics level six so hims is the

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:05,049
health care information management

00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:07,999
Society and they have these levels of

00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:10,819
analytics so level seven is the highest

00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:13,069
so the first hospital in Asia to be so

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:14,660
the first in India second in Asia to be

00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,540
certified at level six actually just

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,910
strictly Stern and deployed it so again

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,569
all of this the Pfister is completely

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,160
free for the downloading and again there

00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:27,919
are some choices to be made as to which

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,269
variant Avista you want and you can talk

00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,249
to me about that offline or ask

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,160
questions but but they're basically

00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:36,889
using free software deploying it on an

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,790
open source stack and getting all of the

00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,790
benefits of doing that

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:53,660
so the the origin service to actually go

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:55,520
back to the late 1970s and so back in

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,640
the 1970s you know computers were coming

00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,320
out many computers and you had all of

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,709
these islands of automation so he had

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,649
different VA hospitals in systems and

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:09,230
they each had different you know

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,270
priorities so maybe one decided to do

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,160
mental health first another one decided

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,680
to do you know cardiology first whatever

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,290
so they started doing the you know

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,790
implementing software and the key thing

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,500
about this was that in all of these

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,660
cases they had programmers and

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,000
caregivers literally sitting side by

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,010
side the caregiver would say this is

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,540
kind of what I want the program would go

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,010
off and program it come back there you

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,300
know two hours later or the next day and

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,760
courtesies this kind of what you had in

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,790
mind so essentially the system was

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,080
developed by the user and the the

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:43,820
programmer working in close

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,740
collaboration and then they started

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,899
hearing about efforts and one you know

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,260
and then they started pouring their

00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:53,600
resources in and doing their work well

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:57,370
at this point so when I say the birth

00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:01,060
through the adversity the VA acquired a

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,770
central information office so they said

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,890
we are the people in the ivory tower who

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:11,059
develop all IT systems you will not

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,589
develop it out in the hospitals so there

00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,880
was this incredible period of several

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,240
years where you know being so there are

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,530
lots of stories so there's one guy who

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:26,329
went out to lunch when he came back his

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,770
computer had been created and shipped

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,160
off elsewhere as far as we know that

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:34,100
computer was never used anywhere else

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,250
there was a another guy who was fired

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,130
and blacklisted they found out that he

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,440
you know so programmers out in the

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,059
hospitals were forbidden from from

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,900
developing electronic health record

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:49,760
systems it was fired eventually I think

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,980
worked as a bus driver or to leave her

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,040
he died school bus driver and did other

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,330
carriers but he never went back to work

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,809
on the system

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:02,119
there's supposedly one case where when a

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,320
guy was away when he came back the

00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:07,459
computer had been taken out to the

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,940
parking lot and set on fire so you know

00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:14,029
so and of course people are resourceful

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,669
people in the in the hospitals developed

00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:19,969
ways so at that time purchasing a mini

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:23,749
computer was forbidden but using a word

00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:25,759
processor was permitted so a lot of the

00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:28,219
hospitals purchased word processors and

00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,070
then the word processors did magical

00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:34,459
things not just processing words so

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:39,559
anyway so all of that was documented in

00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:41,989
that in that first link and eventually

00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,919
what happened was that these people got

00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:45,499
together there was a congressional

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,989
committee that got wind of this and they

00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:51,229
set up a mini computer in a hotel suite

00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:52,879
in Washington DC and actually invited

00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:55,309
the staffer and one of the staffers to

00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:58,519
come see the thing he came and saw it

00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:00,529
and that staffer eventually went on to

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,709
become when he was Chuck Hagel who went

00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,419
on to become a senator from Nebraska

00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:07,549
but he saw this and he went back and

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,379
said hey this thing really works this

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,759
thing really solves the problem the

00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:11,959
Central Information Office has not

00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,440
solved the problem yet

00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:17,539
so that basically mr. became legal at

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,739
that point and became the official way

00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,479
of doing things and of course the

00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:22,309
central information officer yes this is

00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:26,570
kind of what we had in mind all along

00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:29,479
and then the Indian Health Service

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,729
adopted it in the 1980s and again that

00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:33,769
is documented that again there was a

00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,450
process by which it was accepted it

00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:38,769
wasn't as if someone just got up one

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:41,209
morning and said hey I want Vista but

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:45,349
you know but they did that in a

00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:47,869
reasonable fashion and and then I talked

00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:51,320
about how it was sold to the Department

00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:53,089
of Defense in the 1990s and then since

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,339
then there have been a number of both

00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:58,429
successful and failed implementations in

00:19:55,339 --> 00:20:02,269
many locations around the world so back

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:04,129
in the 1990's the the state department

00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,089
is part of foreign aid effort said hey

00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:09,440
Egypt once a has a Cancer Institute

00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,280
let's give them Vista as part of a

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,690
foreign aid

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,250
so they went in they set up the system

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,310
eventually that failed and there are

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,940
failed implementations in in Pakistan in

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,870
a number of other countries like that

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,360
just as there are successful

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,600
implementations both here in abroad and

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,750
I'll talk a little bit about the

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,390
successes and failures now I said the

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,620
slide was the hit was history a little

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,030
bit of future history one of the

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:39,350
unfortunate things that's happening

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:42,440
right now is that over the last so many

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:45,200
years funding for Vista development at

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,460
the VA has been starved because there's

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,740
a lot of politics and now the VA

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,600
supposedly deploying a commercial system

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,510
called Cerner which they think is going

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,130
to solve magically solve a lot of the

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,080
things so the cost of that when we lost

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,630
heard before they'd even implemented any

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,520
software was ten billion dollars the

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,960
latest is sixteen billion dollars and

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,700
I'm sure by the time it's ever deployed

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,910
if it's ever deployed successfully it's

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,490
going to be a lot more than that when by

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,010
hiring I mean let's say you hired twenty

00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,320
thirty programmers and let's say each

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,520
programmer cost a hundred thousand two

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,020
hundred thousand dollars it's still

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,540
going to be a lot less than the cost of

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,680
a commercial Cerner system to to bring

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:26,060
the system back on track but this is the

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,200
you know the the dysfunctional

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,340
environment that we live in and I just

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,900
leave that to you is something to think

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:39,520
about I don't have any answers for that

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,520
I can just see what's happening sorry

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:51,999
right no yeah absolutely

00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:06,139
well mumps is a language beyond a

00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:07,249
database and the core in fact I'll talk

00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:14,659
about why don't you hold that question

00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:17,749
for a few minutes so we'll talk about

00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:19,789
the technology stack so the application

00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:20,239
code is actually written in in M or

00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,399
mumps

00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,710
so mum stands for Massachusetts General

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:26,299
Hospital utility multiprogramming system

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,950
and if you can see that in one breath

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:30,799
you're a better person than I am

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,440
but you know in the healthcare world

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,470
that's an inside joke but it was

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,200
standardized as M by ANSI and by the ISO

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,299
so there's a standard for him it's now

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,460
mostly a doorman standard for for

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:47,989
various commercial reasons but Vista is

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:50,139
written in him and Vista again it's a

00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:53,239
it's at the back end is terminal based

00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:57,129
its roll and scroll with some screen

00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:59,629
oriented capabilities and then it's got

00:22:57,129 --> 00:23:01,549
messaging and web services and remote

00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:07,700
procedure calls for implementing a

00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:11,090
variety of front ends so the it will run

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,509
on any standard M and the VA actually

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,919
uses a proprietary M implementation you

00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,489
already be happens to be an

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,859
implementation of M so our what we did

00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:24,019
is we took an open source implementation

00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,850
of M which I happened to manager at a

00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:28,070
fortune 500 company for over 20 years

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,919
and then we started you already be a

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,659
couple of years ago so M was successful

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,090
because there's a tight marriage between

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:38,720
a programming language and a database

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,399
and what we said is there's no reason

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,549
for the language and the database to be

00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:45,769
so tightly bound so what we did is we

00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:49,070
created a tight binding from C to the

00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,899
database so now you are a DB you can you

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,450
know if you re programming an M there

00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:55,850
using Vista you can use your DB as an

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,910
implementation of M or mumps if you're

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:02,090
writing in some other language C

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,890
or we work here and go and rust and

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,500
eventually there'll be Python and Java

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,540
and other languages as well so we have

00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,190
type bindings to the database from these

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,630
other languages so you don't need to use

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:17,000
em to access the EM database which is

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,920
just a hierarchy hierarchical key value

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,130
database so that's where you already be

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,700
comes in so did that also the question

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:31,730
and and of course the the open source

00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:34,390
operating system is is Linux now the

00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:38,180
front end was that a question there

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,980
sorry I thought so the front end the

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,260
traditional front end that the VA uses

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,020
is actually a thick client it's written

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,510
in Delphi which is an implementation of

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:51,800
Borland from implementation of pascal

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:54,140
from poland and and again the the source

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:58,190
code for this is is open source it runs

00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:01,130
on Windows and and it runs on wine if

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,840
you want to run it on on Linux and then

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:07,010
because of the fact that the the back

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,750
end has got so so the CPRS GUI uses

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,530
remote procedure calls to communicate

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,720
with the back end

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,240
those are pcs are usable so if you

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,360
wanted to create another front end with

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:22,160
a different look and feel you can do

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:25,760
that there are ten clients that use it

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,130
there's a standard called fire if hir is

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,700
how its build so there are fire clients

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,850
that use messaging messaging interfaces

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,670
to to interface with vista and what

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,930
Oroville Hospital is done is audible is

00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,970
actually 60 miles north of Sacramento

00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,050
many of the physicians live in

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:47,300
Sacramento they actually put on a bus

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:50,270
with a secured cellular access and they

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,590
gave the physicians iPads so essentially

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,420
what the physicians do while they're

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,430
commuting on this bus from Sacramento to

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,960
Oroville you're actually checking out

00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,430
the status of all the patients at the

00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,720
hospital and everything they need to do

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,870
so when they actually arrive at the

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:07,040
hospital in the bus they you know what

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:09,650
what's what's ahead so again the back

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,759
end is long-lived it's in mumps but

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,529
obviously

00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:14,209
the front end there are any number of

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:19,039
front ends and you can create front-end

00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:20,719
technologies as you need to not by the

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,359
way don't get me wrong

00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:24,829
creating a front end is not a matter of

00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,419
you know setting up a weekend hackathon

00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:28,339
and then coming up with the front end

00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:32,299
because healthcare is one of the most

00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:34,339
complicated things that we do if you

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,079
want to create a front end there is a

00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:38,209
comprehensive front end for providing

00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,889
healthcare that does need to be a lot of

00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:47,539
design it's not a matter of it's not

00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:51,229
like falling off a log so the the

00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,849
ecosystem health care has a look you

00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:54,559
know a health care information system is

00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:58,399
just part of a complete healthcare

00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:02,539
ecosystem so if you are providing health

00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:04,639
care you need a lot of interfaces to

00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,199
things like imaging right your

00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:09,469
healthcare information system is not

00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:11,629
your imaging system there are actually

00:27:09,469 --> 00:27:14,569
Vista based imaging system Vista imaging

00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:17,749
is the thing where it requires expertise

00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:19,279
to install and run and I don't know if

00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:24,949
it's completely available in an open

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:27,739
source stack if you want analytics well

00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:29,629
that again there are force and open

00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:30,919
source solutions for analytics but

00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:32,989
you'll have to implement them you don't

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,469
they don't come can't Vista essentially

00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:40,129
you get the the whole thing of drug

00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:43,459
interaction databases again in the u.s.

00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:44,989
that comes from a proprietary source the

00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,999
VA actually used to have their own but

00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:49,209
they gave up and they're actually

00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,799
getting that from a proprietary vendor

00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:54,909
now it turns out that there are actually

00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,049
open source drug interaction databases

00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:59,959
there's one from the World Health

00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:02,239
Organization and there's one that is

00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:04,309
actually made available by the French

00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:08,989
government which has been translated

00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:11,119
into into English what I don't know and

00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:14,569
again I'm not a murder clinician I don't

00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,429
I'm a geek so I don't know whether for

00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:18,769
example the World Health Organization

00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:20,899
interaction database or the the French

00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:23,239
database are legal to use in the u.s.

00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,990
from a government regulation point of

00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:27,260
view

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:29,540
I know they are available and similarly

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,540
things like diagnostic codes you know if

00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,320
you go to to the doctor and the doctor

00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,910
orders a test

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,100
there are diagnostic codes written out

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:40,190
there well it turns out those diagnostic

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,350
codes are proprietary and they're owned

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,370
by the American Medical Association so

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,210
there are there are things out there

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,260
that you know our freedom open-source

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,760
and there are things out there that are

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,070
proprietary and there are things that

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,540
way there are alternatives and of course

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,570
the whole thing that's left open out

00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:00,980
here is is billing in the u.s. there are

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:02,840
two completely disjointed sets of health

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,430
IT when it comes to healthcare there's

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,510
the clinical side and then there's the

00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:10,280
health the payer side and and they send

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,410
each other messages back and forth in

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,510
the payer side it's pretty much at this

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,360
point

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:19,190
mostly proprietary but and again it

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,690
varies from state to state and sometimes

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:26,540
even different cities within their state

00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:30,200
okay so if you want to do a versatile

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,850
implementation so just based on looking

00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,880
at all of the implementations that have

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:39,230
succeeded what are some of the things

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,990
that make them succeed so the first

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:45,260
thing is that you know with great power

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,960
comes responsibility how many people out

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:52,070
here have seen the you know the

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,950
magician's assistant in Fantasia okay so

00:29:52,070 --> 00:30:01,010
there are Wester implementations that

00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:03,410
make you think of that and you know and

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,080
and there are some people that think

00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,110
that installing vista is like installing

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,580
an office suite and to some extent

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,320
that's right so literally you can get a

00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,470
docker container and spin it up and it's

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,570
running Vista back in you know 10-15

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,420
years ago actually came up with things

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,290
where with live cds linux live cds when

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,570
they were a thing you could actually

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,400
boot one up and run vista i've created

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:30,020
virtual machines at vista so so

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,030
installing vista is actually trivial but

00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,010
just because you've installed vista

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,260
doesn't mean that you can now provide

00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,760
care for a patient because if you want

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,280
to provide care for a patient

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,750
you need to have your patient you know

00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,960
who's the provider that needs to be

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:48,530
registered if you are providing a test

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,870
result you need to know what machine did

00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,430
the test which lab did the tests so

00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,400
before you can actually provide your

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:57,110
first patient data and record an

00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,060
encounter this all of this setup that

00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,270
has to be done and there's all of the

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,650
setup that has to be maintained and

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,900
providing healthcare literally is one of

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,000
the most mean set aside the the payer

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,140
part of it just on the clinical side

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,060
it's one of the most complicated

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:15,380
endeavors that that we go through and

00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,500
I've heard people then complaining about

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,640
the complexity of the software well the

00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,860
fact is you have to accept that for any

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,900
information technology the complexity of

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,750
the software has to match the complexity

00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:33,110
of the activity that it's supposed to to

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:37,570
automate and so one of the ingredients

00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:40,130
of success is recognizing that this is a

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,070
you know journey not a destination

00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,750
that there's going to be complexity and

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,210
you have to you have to be prepared to

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,470
deal with complexity and the complexity

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,740
of the programming language and the

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,520
application some of it is historical I

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,140
agree but a large part of it is because

00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,350
you're implementing software that Nam

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,270
must match the business logic workflows

00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,370
and business practices of a very

00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,140
complicated enterprise and even if

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,030
you're providing healthcare at the at

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,550
the primary care level that's still a

00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,770
very complicated activity and if you're

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,480
doing that at the level of a secondary

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,760
or tertiary hospital that's you know

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,530
substantially more complicated so the

00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,320
complication and implementing vista

00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:26,570
matches the complication of your

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:30,080
enterprise the other thing is you know

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:32,600
open source actually empowers users it

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,380
shifts the balance of power from the

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:40,060
provider to the user okay and what this

00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:44,000
means is that you need to have as a user

00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:46,280
with the power leading to responsive and

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,860
responsibility going hand-in-hand you

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,580
need to take responsibility for making

00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,290
sure that you have expertise

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,690
now the expertise doesn't mean that you

00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,100
have to have an employee it could be a

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,770
contractor but it means you must have

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,260
the expertise available it's not just

00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,030
that there is some you know first vendor

00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,760
where you can open a support ticket you

00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,440
need to actually know what's going on so

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,720
so this is where the magician's

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,700
expertise comes in assistants expertise

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,080
comes in because if you are running a

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,300
force system in theory if you have

00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,310
enough money and again that's that's the

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,940
big if they're you pay someone they take

00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,710
care of it

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:28,830
but as here you really need to know what

00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:30,600
you're doing another part is you know

00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:34,980
again implementing something like mister

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,580
is a journey and so the ones that I've

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,070
seen there are successful start small so

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:44,250
for example at Central Regional Hospital

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:46,800
they started with some functionality for

00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:51,030
one word and then gradually expanded the

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,490
functionality to other words what they

00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:56,730
did in Jordan was they did a pilot they

00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,170
actually hired a company that had

00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,970
mistakes but he's to come in and do a

00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,980
pilot and when they did the pilot they

00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,620
were watching and they learned and then

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,260
they took over and then after the pilot

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,970
was completed there's a they actually

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,390
formed a non-profit company and that

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:13,679
nonprofit company which is owned by the

00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,240
board of directors from the hospitals

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,610
and the Ministry of Health they actually

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:23,390
then about rolling it out to the rest of

00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:25,679
the country so it's a it's an expansion

00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:29,070
you know but you start small and you

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,280
expand another part of it is that you

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,600
have to plan for change okay

00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,450
a little later on I'm going to tell you

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,260
about a failure where they didn't plan

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:43,560
for change medicine is not static right

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,880
so so you know two years ago who knew

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,770
that measles was going to be a thing

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,720
again and it is you know 10-15 years ago

00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:56,240
who knew that diabetes is going to be a

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:59,940
problem in our society well it is and

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,530
and what that means is then when I say

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,240
software and business processes must

00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,270
track

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,180
this means as a simple example the order

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,520
sets that you issue right so so when you

00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,869
go in for your annual physical it's not

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,950
that the physician says will I need this

00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:15,380
and I need this and I need this

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,420
typically the physician will say I need

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,190
your patient is a male over 65 I need

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,930
this particular order set and they'll

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,220
check that and then if you happen to

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,539
have some other conditions they may

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,140
check a few others but it's not that

00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,069
they go through

00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:33,390
well those order sets will change and so

00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:35,579
your software must track and the other

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:39,960
big thing which is actually a success

00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:42,180
factor of vistas in the VA back when

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,539
they were actively working with Vista I

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,569
mean they're still off but there were a

00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:50,640
large number of small changes it wasn't

00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,319
that they went oh now we can have

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,140
version one now we gonna version two

00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:57,000
that we gonna version three you may have

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,480
a hundred small changes going into the

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,720
course of a month and by making these

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,549
changes small and incremental you know

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,130
nobody gets the butterflies about

00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:09,630
oops me installing this big thing we you

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,520
know what's gonna be your fallback

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:15,020
because everything is you're taking

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:23,339
small steps and that I think is is

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:26,220
important a third thing is contributing

00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:29,700
to the community so this is open source

00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,049
and part of successful open source is

00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,089
your ahima is that you're part of a

00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:35,700
community and you need to contribute to

00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:38,000
the community and what this means is

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,380
let's say even if you're a

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,619
reasonable-sized hospital and you've

00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,349
adopted vista you do not have the

00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,539
resources to maintain all aspects of the

00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,789
software you may need all aspects of the

00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:53,819
software so what you need to do is

00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:55,559
participate in a community where you're

00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:57,690
developers and developers and other

00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:02,700
institutions are collaborating to move

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:05,460
the software forward and this is a key

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,380
factor in success I've seen you know as

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,240
the opposite and failures people that

00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,309
said hey let's just take the software

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,950
it's a it's a free leg up to get started

00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:18,880
now we don't need to go participate

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:21,040
and also and by the way those links are

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,990
some links to some online communities

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,720
and the other thing is to recognize that

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:32,230
there is no one who's an expert in all

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,000
of vista and again this is just like in

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:38,500
healthcare there's no one person who's

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,640
an expert in in all of healthcare and so

00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,410
there are people are experts in the

00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,500
infrastructure Vista has its own for

00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:48,309
example database management system there

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,660
are in fact successful implementations I

00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:52,510
forgot to mention this a couple of

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,770
slides ago a lot of them hire what are

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,380
called clinical applications

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:59,619
coordinators so these are people who

00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,990
might be nurses who might be pharmacists

00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:04,900
who might be laboratory technicians who

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,869
might be doctors they understand the

00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,089
clinical side and they interface with

00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,980
the programmers in the development side

00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:14,200
and they sort of translate because

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,579
otherwise they don't so they understand

00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,359
both sides and they work closely

00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:22,990
together so replicating that success of

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,619
close relationships between the users or

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:28,619
the clinical users and the developers is

00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,619
critical

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:38,300
yeah and this is the builds on what I

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,570
said last time which is you know you

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,950
really need to if it's free and

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,390
open-source software and you want to

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,240
keep it free and open-source you have to

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,970
contribute and you can contribute in

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,880
kind or you can contribute by hiring

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,580
experts in you know paying them and but

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,240
ultimately you know even in the open

00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:01,310
source world we have you know we have to

00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,560
put bread on the table and roofs over

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,270
our heads and you know we have to save

00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:10,010
for retirement and all of those things

00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:11,240
so so I think that you know with all

00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,460
these things tie together like

00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,460
responsible use means even participating

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,060
in the community so this is a key factor

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,060
of success yes

00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:48,250
typically so you so you can so the or

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,810
Sarah well or Sarah which is one of the

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:53,830
other organizations has a github repo

00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:57,790
there's not what there's more not one

00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:59,620
single again the it sort of in some

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,270
sense a little bit like the Linux

00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,520
desktop it's so successful because there

00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:07,420
are so many of them so there's this

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,220
world Wister is sarah vista and they

00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,330
talk all the time so just last week

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,460
there was I was at a conference where

00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,650
they were both there but they

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,390
essentially have separate code bases

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,690
that kind of track each other but

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,690
they're not identical

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:27,850
well upstream there is the foyer from

00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:30,700
the VA and and what what Sarah does is

00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,140
in fact they'll get the the foyer from

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,690
the VA and they'll post it and I think

00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:37,390
well first also gets the foyer but

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,770
ultimately they add things to it so you

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,410
know will vista for example it's got

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,580
pediatric growth charts Coursera has

00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,530
done things like coming up with

00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,480
visualizations of relationships between

00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,880
routines and data and the software and

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,820
they do different things and that's part

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,940
of I guess acquiring expertise where if

00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,480
you want to do this you should start by

00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,550
immersing yourself in the community

00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,540
realize which one best meets your needs

00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:08,310
and then take what you want from the

00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,310
other distributions

00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:16,480
I have some stories of recipes of

00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:24,099
failure

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:27,579
and here I will name names well perhaps

00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:30,569
not for this first slide but you know

00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:33,640
focusing on the next cool technology is

00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:38,200
it's a mistake that is made in

00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:40,290
long-lived systems ok so you know people

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,950
say okey bumps is old

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:53,109
yes mumps is old Yonex is old tcp/ip is

00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:54,849
old one epoch is using mumps and they

00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:56,200
are the largest year so most of us at

00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:57,970
some part of our electronic medical

00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:02,440
records are probably on an epic system

00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:05,920
somewhere they're using mumps the yeah

00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,500
so it is a de facto standard in in in

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,450
healthcare except for Serna which is

00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,180
what the Department of Defense decided

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:21,430
to use and Cerner uses Oracle which is

00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:25,059
somewhat more expensive I would say well

00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:26,619
the front end of epic I you know again

00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:31,660
they have many many front ends so with

00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:33,099
any large system you have a back the

00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,569
back-end might be mom so the back end

00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:36,579
might be whatever but they have

00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,230
messaging interfaces and other

00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,510
interfaces by which you can create new

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,390
front ends now the front end that I know

00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:48,460
about is actually done and Visual Basic

00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:50,530
and and I was actually so my dad about

00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,960
six years ago had open heart surgery at

00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:54,970
Langone Medical Center in New York it

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,609
was on a Friday and normally after you

00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,770
have open-heart surgery they take you to

00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:01,299
this intensive care room where if you're

00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,589
a family member they bring you in for

00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:04,869
like five minutes or ten minutes and

00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:06,369
then they re you out and then an hour

00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:08,530
later they let you come in and so on

00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:10,240
well this time because it is Friday

00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,220
afternoon and most of the cardiac

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,589
intensive care unit was empty except for

00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,569
three or four patients they left my

00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:20,109
sister and me just stay inside and hang

00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:22,720
out and I saw so in this you think they

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,280
actually have a nurse sitting by the

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,950
side of each patient 20

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,600
seven and they had and they were running

00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,970
epic and they had this nurse running

00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,710
this visual basic interface and I could

00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,870
see that this interface was just right

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,920
no she would hit my dad with nothing in

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,480
the system so he was literally going

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,700
back and forth between my dad and the

00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,240
system I'm sure they have other

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,800
interfaces for for other applications

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,940
but the back end is mumps the front end

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,230
is whatever and and that was six years

00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,600
ago maybe they have something completely

00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,400
different today because front-end

00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:59,470
technology changes much more rapidly

00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,780
than back-end technology does but for

00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,940
the backend you know focusing on the

00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,420
next cool thing I think is a as a

00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,760
problem medical records are long-lived

00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:15,280
so I think so if you look at mumps for

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:19,510
example day zero is actually December

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,720
31st 1840 because one of the things was

00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,860
when it was implemented part of it was

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,020
they wanted to make sure that there

00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,390
would be no human being alive who would

00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,640
have a negative age or a negative date

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:35,290
of birth and you know it was just what

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,180
are those things and then knowledge is

00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,700
actually embedded in the source code and

00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,860
this is a fact of any large application

00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,210
where you can't just say I'm gonna

00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,730
replace it because there is always

00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:49,210
knowledge in the in the source code even

00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:50,890
if you say we're gonna document it no as

00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:59,410
I said the front-end technology changes

00:44:50,890 --> 00:45:01,590
so I'm gonna name names out here so if

00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:05,140
you don't keep your business logic and

00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:08,110
your Vista in lockstep you can have

00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:10,780
problems so I was so one of the adoptees

00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:15,370
Avista was the Mexican Social Security

00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:18,910
Administration now in Mexico if you are

00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:21,250
an employee of a company they pay you

00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,040
pay sub and your employer pays of Social

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:26,050
Security tax and as part of this you're

00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,710
entitled the care from their Social

00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:32,980
Security Administration so I was at mr.

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,570
meetings in 2003 and there were some

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,370
people from Mexico that said yeah we're

00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,330
interested in Vista and then we didn't

00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,700
hear from them for a year

00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:41,490
and they came back a year and a half

00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,390
later and said we've implemented Vista

00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:48,280
wow that's amazing

00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:50,440
and it turns out what they had done was

00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,060
it actually gone indeed hired a team so

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,610
they had like that implemented it it's

00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:57,040
something like sixty hospitals which is

00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,660
amazingly fast so they hired this

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,300
company they hired a team the team would

00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,530
go into a hospital spend six weeks at

00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,580
the hospital and train the users

00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:08,320
implement the system and leave so anyway

00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,790
I got to visit one of the largest

00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:14,290
Women's and Children's Hospital in

00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:19,390
Mexico City back in let's say 2006 the

00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:22,780
hospital had a capacity of 200 beds you

00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:25,270
walk around the hospital you know some

00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,330
beds are full so more empty according to

00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:32,200
the Vista system there are 600 patients

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,750
in the hospital but Europe you walk

00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,400
around you don't see multiple patients

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:40,360
sharing a bed you don't see patients on

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,490
the floor so the problem was that when

00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,340
someone was well let's say someone came

00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:47,020
and gave birth to baby whatever the

00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,420
nursing staff would say fine you can

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,880
pack up and leave they never went into

00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:55,300
their Vista system to say this patient

00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,920
is now discharged so they had 600

00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,570
patients according to the Vista system

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,540
and when I visited the end they were

00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:03,550
actually planning on one weekend later

00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,960
that month they were actually going to

00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,490
have all employees in and they were

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,110
gonna do a physical inventory of

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,390
patients in the hospital so that they

00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,670
could go into the Vista system and and

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,820
sort of discharge the ones who not there

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:17,410
anymore so this is what you get when you

00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,270
don't keep your business processes and

00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:21,270
your IT in in lockstep

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:31,820
so you know another one is managing it

00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,230
like a an office suite and talked about

00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,960
the Mexican Social Security

00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,820
Administration now they did that at

00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,420
record time because they had a CR you at

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:44,150
the time wrote all this stuff

00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:46,850
implement Vista or get fired okay so

00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:49,520
that is a powerful incentive so the

00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,990
implemented Vista and as I said they had

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,150
these teams that would go in six weeks

00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:55,580
they had two teams so they were doing

00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,740
three hurts to hospitals every one

00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:00,980
Hospital every three weeks they were

00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:03,620
gone in six weeks implement Vista they

00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,780
had these computers IT rooms in each

00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:08,120
hospital with backup power supplies and

00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,620
they would leave there was no journaling

00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,900
to recover in the event of a system

00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,690
crash there was no updating it is

00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:18,620
basically just a fire-and-forget of of a

00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:20,090
healthcare IT system and what I told you

00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,490
about the Women's and Children's

00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:25,910
Hospital was just one example eventually

00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:28,580
the system you know keeled over and died

00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:31,190
because the employees implemented it the

00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,570
aleph moved on to other things and those

00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,270
who left didn't know how to maintain it

00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:37,640
and they just had this system running in

00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:43,670
the in the back office that became less

00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:45,890
and less relevant with time so not

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:51,010
investing in sustaining expertise is as

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:53,530
a problem so talked about the the

00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,910
implementations are profound it by the

00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,010
Department of State in the 1990s like

00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,930
the Egypt Cancer Institue you they never

00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:02,690
developed expertise they went in they

00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,920
implemented the system the you know may

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,970
have done some training and whatnot but

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,640
ultimately if you are using an

00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,830
open-source system you need to accept

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,480
that this is your system you own it you

00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,100
need to have the expertise to run it and

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,200
this is what I think the Jordanians did

00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,440
right and the Egyptians and others did

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,440
wrong

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:28,150
for sure it's not just for open source

00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:29,560
but yeah but but the the failure

00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,730
examples are help from you know

00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:37,810
obviously these are with mr.

00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:41,650
specifically ignoring the ecosystem as a

00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:45,160
is another issue so I know of at least

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:48,190
one company and we're at least one

00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,900
company that just said hey here's this

00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,340
Vista system from the VA we can take

00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,890
that we can use that to start our

00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,190
company and then we don't need to

00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,480
participate in the ecosystem anymore

00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:01,240
well the company still has the Vista

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,000
system but eventually they ended up

00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,070
acquiring other things that sort of

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,750
migrating to other parts of the business

00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,520
where no Vista is just a small part of

00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,470
the of their business and it's mostly

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,900
they're not getting new customers

00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,460
they're just maintaining the customers

00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,710
that they acquired 10 or 15 years ago

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,230
and those customers are kind of stuck

00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:22,870
with the system just as much as they'd

00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:26,620
be stuck with any other you know system

00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:32,170
that's it's slowly getting obsolete so

00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:36,250
the ecosystem is important and that

00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:37,630
brings me to the end of the talk I you

00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,980
know I thought I'd be done sooner but

00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:43,900
you know we do have time for discussion

00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:46,060
and questions and let me let me come

00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,640
down because I've got to a point now

00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:51,610
where my hearing isn't as good as it

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,380
used to be and either you need to talk

00:50:51,610 --> 00:51:08,770
very loudly or I need to come close to

00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:14,380
you so I think

00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:17,320
but in 2007 there was a thing called

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:20,320
Vista office EHR which did get certified

00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,700
and then there was a variant of that

00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,720
which is certified under something

00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:44,100
called meaningful use yeah so it was

00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:47,910
certified spots for you to contribute

00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:54,340
and they do use github for theirs and

00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:56,830
and they are high-tech certified so I I

00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:59,830
know that at one point and again I was

00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:01,810
involved in that many years ago so I was

00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:04,750
actually one of the cofounders of world

00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:06,190
Vista and then I had a you know full

00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,260
time job and I was running the

00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:13,050
organization so I had to step down at

00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:16,810
some point because I also had kids but

00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:19,270
I'd be happy to connect you with Nancy

00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:21,220
anthracite who is the Arab world Vista

00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:37,780
and you can ask the question about the

00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:41,490
current status on that so the question

00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:46,600
was has anyone from MySQL or PostgreSQL

00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:50,650
database the answer is no and there are

00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:52,690
several reasons for that so one of them

00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:56,560
is that those are relational databases

00:52:52,690 --> 00:53:01,170
and this is a hierarchical key-value

00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,170
database so you don't quite match

00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:10,570
okay then that gets to the second part

00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:12,970
of the answer which is that because of

00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:14,560
the tight integration of the mumps

00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:17,110
language at the mumps database which you

00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,780
don't get with Postgres in mysql with

00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:24,220
their newer json and other architectures

00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:25,870
is one of performance so on a so if you

00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,610
like it like the the Jordanian system

00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,950
we're running on an x86 linux server

00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,230
it's not a terribly expensive server but

00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:35,200
it's a x86 linux server grade machine

00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:38,970
and they're currently running something

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,550
like seven thousand concurrent users and

00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:44,500
literally running on that machine and no

00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:58,270
other database would be capable of

00:53:44,500 --> 00:54:00,970
running that that machine in a

00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:05,320
completely different application I have

00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:08,500
a story and here I can't name names for

00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:11,290
various reasons but this was a banking

00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,200
application running on our database and

00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:16,810
then working with a one of the big

00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,990
proprietary california-based database

00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:23,830
vendors so that vendor actually worked

00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:25,630
with the company to port to their their

00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:29,140
database and they were actually a couple

00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:33,760
of customers that ran on it and and when

00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:35,520
they ran on that database the and then

00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,590
later on they switched back to the

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,500
database that I was responsible for and

00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:45,070
the Danes went from an order to half to

00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:47,590
ten minute under ten minutes so there

00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:49,900
are actually documented differences in

00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:52,240
performance now I'm sure that there are

00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,920
other examples where the reverse would

00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,160
be true with they've done optimizations

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,600
that are not in the EM database

00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,800
ultimately optimizations in all a matter

00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:05,650
of finding me the use cases that you

00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,090
need to optimize and then optimizing

00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,560
those and then there are the use cases

00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:12,850
that you don't so the way that I always

00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,180
and again this is back when I marriage

00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,010
the

00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,589
the implementation the PIO mumps

00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,240
implementation rather than your a DB the

00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:21,970
analogy I would always use is that the

00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,890
the big relational databases that's like

00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:26,050
a minivan and a many burners something

00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,730
for taking the kids to a soccer game

00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:30,010
taking a vacation across the country

00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:32,829
commuting to work it's like a general

00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:35,829
purpose solution whereas the mumps

00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,030
database is more like a a truck right so

00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:38,559
if you need to move a lot of goods from

00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,960
point A to point B you would use that

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,569
but you certainly wouldn't take the kids

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:48,940
to a football game in a truck other than

00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:50,109
perhaps on Halloween so it's a it's

00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,020
something completely different so you

00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:58,270
can't quite compare the two and I do

00:55:53,020 --> 00:56:02,710
know of so there was a an Israeli

00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:05,470
company that developed a mumps to Java

00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:10,210
translator and they translated the the

00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:11,859
application to Java and what was let's

00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:14,920
say hundred and some megabytes of source

00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:18,069
code became something like several

00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:23,020
gigabytes of source code working against

00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:25,720
a brand name relational database and it

00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,010
basically tanked it couldn't run and

00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,359
there are also examples when the

00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:31,150
Department of Defense tried replacing

00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:32,470
one of their systems so anyway it's all

00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,770
a question of having the right tool for

00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,770
the job

00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:51,430
actually pdp-7 III have another whole

00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,410
talk on the history of that with you I I

00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,540
gave last year and I can you know give

00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,490
it again maybe if you if you come for

00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,020
the after dinner party with a with a

00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:22,270
beard with a beer in my hand I can give

00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:23,950
the talk again but yeah exactly so the

00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:30,610
back end is a pretty module program to

00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:32,200
name and to the state and part of the

00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:33,400
challenge there is you know there are

00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,370
some modules which are written

00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,020
originally in the 1980s and the

00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,930
standards of the code may not quite be

00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:43,960
what they are today so you really have

00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:46,330
to learn to code with that standard or

00:57:43,960 --> 00:58:05,710
to update the module that's common to

00:57:46,330 --> 00:58:08,230
any large software system file mine is

00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:11,070
the database management system under

00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,070
within Vista

00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:51,760
they give him a very old now this may

00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:53,890
have changed to something but they never
