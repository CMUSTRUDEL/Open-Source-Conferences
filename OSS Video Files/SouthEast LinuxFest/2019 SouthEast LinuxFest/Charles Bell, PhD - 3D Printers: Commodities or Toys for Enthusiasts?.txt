	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
It has been over a decade since affordable 3D printers have become widely available. Many expected a massive revolution in manufacturing and others predicted 3D printers would populate nearly every home. Has any of these expectations been met? Have the predictions come true?

Join us as we discover the path 3D printing has taken of the recent years including the state of 3D printers today. If you've ever wanted to know what all of the fuss was about, drop by and see how you can learn what 3D printing can do for you.

so it's been over a decade can you

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,049
believe it's been a decade since

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,300
affordable put big air quotes around

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,130
affordable 3d printers have become

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,630
available

00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,400
most people will expected a massive

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,279
revolution in the 3d printing industry

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,380
they've predicted by now every house

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,689
would have a 3d printer and when you

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,789
wanted to buy something you would simply

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,039
buy it online and your 3d printer would

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,220
were and it print spit out in the next

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,320
room and well gee I don't think it's

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,079
quite there yet so some of the questions

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,260
is I want you to think about us have any

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,210
of these expectations been met how about

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,790
the predictions have they come true is

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,040
there a 3d printer in every home can you

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,170
order online and print out well it turns

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,379
out with MakerBot you kind of sort of

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,559
can for a very very narrow kind of thing

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,989
they have their own 3d printing design

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,699
library that you can buy and then it

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,739
will download it and print directly on

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,750
your MakerBot printer so kind of cool

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,399
that way but yeah you can't buy a new

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,850
coffeemaker and have it print out for

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,310
you that doesn't work so consumer versus

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,560
professional versus industrial it's kind

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,439
of sore about the price but not exactly

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,560
a consumer are those affordable types

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,119
again air quotes around that but they're

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,080
mostly for the enthusiast or the

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,259
hobbyist knew the difference between

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,090
enthusiasts and a hobbyist goes like

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,979
this a hobbyist says gee I'd like to get

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,460
into that enthusiast says oh look

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,810
there's another one I'll buy it that's

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,549
the difference so owning at one point an

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,360
embarrassing number of 3d printers and

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:43,439
now I'm down to five in the enthusiast

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,810
category but so the consumer printers

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,549
are largely governed by their features

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,680
in price what's affordable to the

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,030
average person kind of thing

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,369
professional and out of hand tend to

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,229
have more features typically they're

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,509
their build areas so you can build

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,520
bigger things with it and they are

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,979
usually higher cost not always though

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,259
and they're made for longer prints and

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,689
longer life of the printer industrial

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,789
the other hand goes even further those

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,069
are the big monster machines that they

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,200
use for CAD cam design

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,840
a lot of prototyping sometimes even

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,420
producing real parts some industrial

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,310
printer companies will print your parts

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,010
for you so if you got a really cool part

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,749
you want to print it in stainless steel

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,400
you can get them to do it it's not cheap

00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:29,639
but they'll do it for you

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,709
so they used typically exotic materials

00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,019
very expensive and they're built for

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,000
heavy-duty industrial use

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,769
did I mention they're expensive we're

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,209
talking to tens the hundreds of thousand

00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,669
perhaps even millions of dollars here

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,980
for these things but this talk I'm going

00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,030
to talk about consumer 3d printers I

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,340
won't talk a lot of bit about

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,569
professional 3d printers but when I talk

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,949
about the vendors I'll show you some

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,239
examples of vendors that have

00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:56,549
professional quality printers so are

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,769
there commodity well that depends on how

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,299
you look at it the answer is no if you'd

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,159
expect to be able to buy them and then

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,579
they Best Buy or your electronics store

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,930
down the road and we're not there yet

00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:09,000
unless you're near a reseller and there

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,230
are precious few resellers if you live

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,909
in Southern California there's an

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,790
excellent one that I'll talk about a

00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,009
little bit if you're a DIY or you liked

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,319
your maker or something equivalent I'll

00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,509
do it IOT enthusiast something like that

00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,829
you can build your buy your own parts

00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,790
online and build your own 3d printer

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,750
it's not overly difficult to do that and

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,049
parts are plentiful

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,259
like most hobbies knowing what parts to

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,949
buy what parts to avoid is the real

00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:41,699
trick there so kind of sort of yes or no

00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:44,340
where are we now well one of the great

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,870
proponents for 3d printing a company

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,239
called Printrbot everybody heard of

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,500
Printrbot so you'd only been going

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,959
almost a year and almost nobody I don't

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,780
remember Printrbot was famous because

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,790
they they really did produce affordable

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,759
printers they had a 300 dollar printer

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,040
that was built with laser cut plywood

00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,739
yeah it worked fairly well I had a

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,900
couple of them they were pretty well

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,189
especially if you upgraded them you

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,479
spent some time with him you can get

00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,269
some pretty good quality out of them

00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,840
they switched about two years ago from

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,840
laser cut plywood to powder coated metal

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,440
and it raised the price two and three

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,610
times so their niche of affordable small

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,949
printers went away it's

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,620
very unhappy business decision there so

00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,469
they're gone some of the smaller DIY

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,229
part gatherers the 3d printer kit

00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:38,560
companies they're gone and there's no

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,969
surprise there some pundits some people

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,580
will look out there the 3d printing

00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:44,139
industry have claimed or to continue to

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,139
claim that 3d printing has seen its

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,379
better days and that it's just a fad

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:53,680
it's it's you know had its time and it's

00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,870
done the hype is over the startup is

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
gone nobody cares anymore

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,340
future expansion has slowed considerably

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,439
we're not seeing these Jesus with his

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,180
features like most products when they

00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,919
first come out on the market they've

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,419
come out with a pretty basic and they

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,430
work and then somebody has a new feature

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,039
and it really improves things and it

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,689
goes on from there and so they're saying

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,099
well we've reached this plateau we don't

00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,919
see anything new with 3d printing so

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,659
therefore it's dead they point out that

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,219
you still have to fiddle with the 3d

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:23,830
printers to get anymore even the best

00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:27,930
ones you buy and don't work out of the

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,669
box and there is some truth to that but

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,349
we'll talk more about that there is some

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,599
good news though about where we are now

00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,529
the sales from the big vendors the some

00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,560
of the vendors I'm going to talk about

00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:41,169
today they're very strong they're going

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,960
quite well and they are approving their

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,150
products are becoming better every day

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,800
or I should say every year there have

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,050
been some improvements in the years

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,219
recent years but not the meteoric rise

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,379
that we've seen in the past decade

00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:58,360
filament quantity the the plastic that

00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,589
you feel feed into these printers was a

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,930
big source of problem for a long time

00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:07,020
when you were by filament sometimes you

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,430
would buy filament that was inexpensive

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,550
only to find out the quality was so bad

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,400
you couldn't use it after half a roll it

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,729
was exposed to humidity or it was dried

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,009
out or the diameter of the filament

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:25,139
buried through the rope which caused

00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:27,219
major problems with print quality and

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,189
you know there was a lot of problems

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:32,469
with that the field of fenders has

00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,719
narrowed considerably he used to be able

00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:37,139
to go out on eBay say five years ago and

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,749
see some pretty good kits out there

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,400
and I don't know what happened but at

00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:44,069
some point a lot of those went away now

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,520
you see very few kids most of them come

00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:49,590
from Asia but the 3d printing for the

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,499
consumer is still alive and well you can

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,029
buy you know name-brand printers that

00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,189
work very well from companies that

00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:58,249
support their products the kids that you

00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:02,819
buy typically don't have any support

00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:05,999
with one exception I'll show you current

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:09,090
challenges the challenges today for

00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:12,060
modern printers or the newest printers

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,979
is still around the one thing in

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,629
particular that bill plate material now

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,169
you have a bill plate where you whether

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,729
3d printer builds the part but on top of

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,250
that usually have some sort of treatment

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,889
something that will allow the filament

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,099
to stick to for the for the part to form

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,569
those build plates materials that I'm

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,819
talking about is where we have a lot of

00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:36,689
challenge right now there is no one

00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:39,060
solution no one solution that's going to

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:42,150
work for every kind of filament or for

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,330
every printer or for every vendors

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,759
printer even so some people have these

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,080
voodoo liking performance experiments

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,419
where they say well you got to got to

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,580
use this and it's got to be this

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,729
particular hairspray from this salon

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,649
don't get that Revlon stuff and it works

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,509
this way you got to put it on make sure

00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:03,149
you flow from left to right like you're

00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,439
painting a bicycle you know know forward

00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,639
admire it's gonna be living right

00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,169
I'm not kidding that's how a lot of

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,149
people read you look out on the internet

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,129
you'll see that and they'll say you got

00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:12,270
to do it this way don't let it come like

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,789
a comp you gotta hope again

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,300
but they fail to point out that that

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:20,219
material or the hairspray they're

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,589
spraying it on top of another piece of

00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:26,610
material they rarely mentioned what that

00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:28,289
is is it glass is it steel is it cat and

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,699
tape is it something else

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,469
yeah they don't mention those kind of

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,419
things so you'll see all kinds of

00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,599
articles out there about the best new

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,949
treatment don't let's do it no one

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,729
treatments going to work for you you're

00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:42,419
going to have to do your own

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,790
experimentation to figure it out some

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,540
other challenges for 3d printing is ease

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,120
of use is a big

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,339
a lot of times you buy a printers and

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,050
let's say you've read some material or

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,580
something and you've got some friend to

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,959
help you out and you learn about it or

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,910
maybe you've worked with them in school

00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,800
or whatever and then you get one you get

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,930
it home it's great everything starts

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,399
working and then something happens and

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,620
they you can't figure out why it's

00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,810
giving you this error why isn't it

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,899
printing it's just blinking at me yeah

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,140
so ease of use is a big challenge some

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:16,510
vendors do better at that than others so

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,670
you have a very much right out of the

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,260
box your mileage may vary experienced

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,760
I've talked to people they've pulled

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,500
them out of the box they plugged him in

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,790
turn it on they printed a whistle you

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,470
know within 10 minutes they had a

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,209
whistle everything's great I've talked

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,390
to people that say well I had it I

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:33,430
bought it in September and well I got a

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,040
bunny but I can't get the whistle to

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,740
print now this it really is just like

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,510
that you've got to work with it and I'll

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,640
talk more about that filament

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,300
availability and stability is getting a

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,610
lot better

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,580
it's not quite there yet but it's a lot

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,620
better one tip is if you buy a printer

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,850
3d printer whatever manufacturer you're

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,480
buying from if they make their own

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,040
filament buy it so if you're if you're

00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,399
into MakerBot's and you find the

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,670
MakerBot's buy it and MakerBot filament

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,440
it's just it just works better that way

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,000
even if they do have quality issues you

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,850
can call him up and say hey it didn't

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,550
work send me a new reel and they will

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,920
yeah so another area the quest for the

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,350
best extruder and that's the part that

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,029
actually heats up and melts the filament

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,839
and pushes it through what we call the

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,610
nozzle was a hot end that extruder

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,670
sometimes including both a cold and

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,980
honey and have had a lot of development

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,510
in recently most of the major vendors

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,029
like Ulta maker lulzbot Prusa they use

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,209
pretty much their own designs but there

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,880
are a number of different nozzles and

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:46,060
and hot ins and cold ends that you can

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,610
use III D makes a very good one for your

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,670
DIY ears and I use that exclusively on

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,620
any printer I build but there are some

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,560
really strange excuse out there you have

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,760
to look at it here's a little pet peeve

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,139
from ice

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,399
if I know the difference between an

00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:04,269
actual and radio fan axial and radial

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,370
fan

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,350
okay ones like your house fan this fins

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,959
are out the first right I thought it was

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,180
like the fan in your HVAC they have

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,339
different properties they don't do the

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,670
same thing so when you want to cool

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:21,190
something in a general area you use the

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,529
actual fan there ad you like your house

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,949
fan just blows air if you want to

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,630
precision guide it or direct the air

00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:30,910
you're going to want to use a radial fan

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,329
so when I see these new extruders with

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,220
actual fins on them for part colors it

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:39,760
makes me cringe because they're not

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,230
efficient you want Radio fans okay it's

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,389
not one of those cult things it's just

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,769
one of those people are not aware kind

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:48,579
of things so what they do with the

00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:50,199
actual fans is they put a duct on it so

00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:52,089
there's got this cone thing on it that

00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,670
directs the air you don't have to do

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:58,500
that folks if you buy a radio fan okay

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:01,720
that's its job but so there's an example

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,800
Prince Pete Prince be diligent I think

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,240
it's going to challenge for another

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,889
technique coming it really is a

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,949
challenge right now I know I'll talk

00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,269
more about that in a little bit so at

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:11,709
this point you're going wait what's the

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,139
3d printer you talking about a hot hands

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,850
build plates actual movements what is

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,339
all that there's an excellent website

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,920
from Manor hackers calm that it gives

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:23,560
the anatomy of 3d printers or if you

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,690
find a book that talks about 3d printing

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,779
they'll tell you all about 3d printers

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,860
and all the parts that go with it I

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,709
could probably spend two hours talking

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,720
about that so let's talk about the

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,180
vendors the leading vendors

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,430
I'm not ranked them necessarily I just

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,000
listed the leading vendors these are the

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,440
top six vendors that I think anyone

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,449
who's interested in 3d printing would

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,850
probably want to check out one or more

00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:51,870
of these some of them have different

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,220
types of products some of them or offer

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,019
kits that you can build yourself which I

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,910
can be very rewarding if you'd like to

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,519
tinker with things like to build your

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,589
own things and they have excellent

00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,649
instructions otherwise I wouldn't I

00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,120
wouldn't recommend them so the first two

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,329
Ultimaker and lulzbot

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,350
and well I have to include MakerBot they

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,840
make printers that are

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:17,740
fully assembled you don't buy those as

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,140
kits Ultimaker makes their own brand of

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,500
printer they're one of the early vendors

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,090
they have perfected their printer they

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,840
have a very particular style you'll see

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,450
that in a moment

00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,090
lulzbot is another one that's that ones

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,550
ultra makers in europe those buttons in

00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:37,000
the US and Colorado they have a very

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,040
unique frame that they've created it

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,690
works very well they are also one of the

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,230
vendors who went around early on and

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,880
their printers actually resemble DIY

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,440
printers more than a the others they

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,420
haven't spent a lot of time on that sled

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,560
aesthetics I'll talk about a little bit

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,930
Prusa research Prusa Joseph brucellosis

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,040
freezer was one of the guys who created

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:01,930
one of the original 3d printing designs

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,730
3d printer designs he created his own

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,470
company proofs her research you can buy

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,890
fully assembled printers from there or

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,800
kits that's interesting MakerBot was

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:14,020
another one of the first 3d printers out

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,370
there but they've got a little bit of

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,680
bad rap because at one point they were

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,260
open-source and they were bought by

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,240
Stratos and they closed sourced

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,390
everything

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,820
so though their printers are among these

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,520
printers that I'm talking about there's

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,310
this at least modifiable they have gone

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,990
I'm talking 180 it used to be you could

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,880
tinker with them do anything one wasn't

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,560
now the only thing you can do with them

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,810
and change the extruder and you have to

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,160
buy their extruder or build plate and

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,870
yet to buy built their bill please

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,550
there's almost nothing you can change on

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,440
a MakerBot to improve it but that's okay

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,330
I'll talk more about that in a minute

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,640
see me C&C is well probably the smallest

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:58,240
bender here that they make Delta

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,650
printers oh it's a delta printer most

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,260
three pairs that you're seeing are

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:05,500
Cartesian meaning their axis movements

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,590
follow the Cartesian planes a delta

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,500
printer has three actual vertical actual

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,990
movements connected to a center part

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,210
let's call it and then as those arms

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,830
move it moves that part of the head

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,350
around in three-dimensional space there

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,330
are wonder to behold there they're

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,449
fascinating when you're printing it you

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,429
find out you know you look

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,899
he's staring and watching your part and

00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:28,069
you realize wait a minute 25 minutes are

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,439
gone by I'm really should answer my

00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,879
boss's email now yeah that kind of thing

00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:33,410
so they're they're kinda neat

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,540
this last vendor is an interesting

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,609
vendor it's I call it a 3d printer

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,230
superstore Manor hackers they don't make

00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:41,959
their own printers but he's tell

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,359
everybody else's and they sell parts

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,980
falou they sell their own filament they

00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:49,040
even have their own 3d printing software

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,139
called manner control they also service

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,489
them so you can their one-stop

00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,619
superstore you can get everything you

00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:57,139
want you want that ulka maker but you

00:15:54,619 --> 00:16:00,499
want the support with it call manner

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:02,689
hackers yeah whatever you want and they

00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:05,089
have a wide variety of printers they

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:07,009
sell let's look at some of these Ulta

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,889
maker these are what the Ultimaker

00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:12,230
printers look like the one on the far

00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:14,809
right Ultima Core 2 plus it's their

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,059
second series with three parts in it

00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:18,919
that's why they call it 2 plus they used

00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,439
to have a mini but they they stopped

00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,239
making it because it sell very well

00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:25,819
these printers typically use 3

00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:29,720
millimeter filament the bill plate is

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:32,119
glass they do have a needed option on

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,749
the left is their Professional Series

00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:37,069
the ultimate s5 not 5s I guess they

00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:41,029
didn't want to be associated with Apple

00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:42,980
too much but it's the s5 they also make

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:45,350
their own software called cura and

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,179
actually the Kuro software is used by a

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,579
lot of people it supports more than just

00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:52,039
the elta maker printers they have an

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,629
interesting thing with the 3 they may

00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:57,410
have added to the 2 plus I didn't check

00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:59,629
their extruders have cartridge designs

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,579
so you can snap them in and snap them

00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:03,169
out which means if you want to change

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,689
the nozzle size you could have

00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:07,939
additional hot ends that you just pop in

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,860
there that helps with different types of

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,809
filament they're pretty neat a lot of

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,120
people swear by ultra makers for very

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:16,549
good reasons are very stable these are

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,649
there incidentally on these slides or

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,839
this is their hype from the website and

00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:24,470
it's all true except when I tell you

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,880
it's not ok alright little spot this is

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,260
what the a little spot printers look

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,450
like they look more like you know

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,789
serious get it done type printers and

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,490
they are they're very robust they they

00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,940
are really workhorses

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,010
they're used in

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,570
conferences past someone would bring one

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,970
here and have it at the conference

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,610
they'd have the little mini woman left

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,050
and it would work and they'd print parts

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,440
for you right before your eyes and all

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,610
that and they just they just work

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,280
interesting thing is they they are

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,990
upgradeable whereas the Ultimaker are

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,820
upgradable but the Alta makers have a

00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,070
pretty much ready to go

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,110
those want are two but if you want to

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,610
use exotic filaments and a second

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,400
extruder or something like that lulzbot

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,350
makes parts for those now they're big

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,900
workhorse to call that as on the right

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,860
it's a little expensive it's closer to

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,670
what I would consider a

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,890
professional-grade

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,690
so they're consumer grade is more than

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,680
mini but you can't go wrong with the

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,450
mini it's a very very good printer and

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,060
then there's proofs of research now they

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,950
make two types of printers right now one

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,660
is I would not consider it a consumer

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,680
printer there their mainstream printer

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,530
is the i3 or

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,570
iteration 3 Prusa i3 if you were to look

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,270
at some of the kits out there available

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,700
to ebay and other sites you'll see a

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,220
three up here again again that just

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,700
refers to the design and the design is

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,750
one where the x and y ax Q's me the

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:52,530
z-axis is on a vertical plane which is

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,800
usually heavy aluminum so it's the black

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:58,320
square frame there and so the z-axis

00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,870
would ride on that and the x and y is on

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,830
its own little carriage at the bottom

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:07,440
that's very distinctive design one thing

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,650
I don't like about this design is you

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,950
see how the spools were at the top okay

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,170
unless the Z plane the big thick

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,970
aluminum is Mountain is very strong and

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,340
it is on the purser by the way from

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,100
Prusa research this is good from some of

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,830
the Clones that is going to cause a

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,960
wobble it's going to cause X & Y plane

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,790
shifts because as the printer is

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,590
printing that big heavy thing way up top

00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:35,610
start fleshing kind of like this podium

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,530
does when I moved it same principle but

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,300
again producer research don't suffer

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,190
from that so I'm heading out out to

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,190
those that wants to build their own on

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,530
the right is their SL 1 printer this is

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,440
a resin printer that uses ultraviolet

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,990
light so it hits the resin and

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,050
solidifies on a row a line or a plane at

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,550
a time those require curing so you

00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,560
actually take the part out you have to

00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,450
cure it I wanted to show you that to

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,060
show you that there's more than just the

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,680
FFF type printers out there but the one

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,720
on the right I think it starts running

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,840
around $2,000 without the curing

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,130
equipment so it's very very pricey but

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,710
you can't go wrong with a booster

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,250
research printer and interesting about

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,900
those if you bought it for today

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,000
and next year they come up with a new

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,520
model they will sell you an upgrade kit

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,840
so you can upgrade their there the whole

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,670
thing there's everything you need for

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,440
the new parts you could do that some

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,000
extent lulzbot does that occasionally as

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,130
well particularly if they improve the

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,060
extruder you can buy the new extruder

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:39,510
and it works just fine MakerBot now I

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:42,090
started wars MakerBot way back when the

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,210
MakerBot were made out of laser-cut

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:48,810
plywood that goes back a ways

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:51,390
today they are they are closed source

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,460
they are make a particular printer like

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,290
I said that you know you can't change

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,620
anything in them they're not adjustable

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:02,510
to some extent and you've got to buy

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,160
their parts and for they sell a lot to

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,050
education so educators are used to

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,700
MakerBot printers because they'd show up

00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:11,970
in schools a lot the stem schools have

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,620
them right now for consumer grade you on

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,930
the bottom row there or the one on the

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,640
right a mini plus replicator mini plug

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,070
that's a consumer frame and the one

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,050
second from the left is a similar that's

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,090
the replicator plus so there are

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,290
different in scales

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,540
replicator plus is more like a

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,460
professional grade printer and then it's

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,500
bigger but I don't really see it as a

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,320
professional grade they they promote it

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,060
as such but because you can't do

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,400
anything with it I think you're kind of

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:42,150
stuck with it not that it's a bad

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,760
printer but the z18 and the mate of the

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:47,820
method are their latest printers the z18

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,520
sits about a 100 about this tall it's a

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,410
very large format printer I think I've

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,070
seen them used around five grand

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:58,290
so they're very very expensive

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,750
interesting thing about the z18 they

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,300
have a heated chamber so instead of

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,070
heating the bed

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:09,410
it heats the entire inside of the

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:12,830
cabinet very interesting principle tall

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:14,600
with that thing the method on the far

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,090
left is their professional grade printer

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,820
and that's a one-stop thing software

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,830
design all the things wrapped together

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,040
it's a really kind of a turnkey thing

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,480
for like are textual firms or

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,260
manufacturing and things like that

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,420
spelled expensive okay

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,450
simi C&C here's a delta right here's

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,480
what they look like simi C&C have three

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,240
current Delta printers the one on the

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,070
left the Artemis is a fully assembled

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,290
printer that you buy and you ship to you

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,350
it's about two foot tall so it's not

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,990
really a mini but it's a fairly well

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,940
it's a fairly small bill plate but the

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,130
build area of a typical Cartesian

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,230
printer it's some sort of rectangle okay

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,270
sometimes a cube but mostly a rectangle

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,720
in the case of replicators

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,330
these are cylinders so the built Barry

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,670
is a cylinder for Delta printer the one

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,490
in the middle is their main stream ro

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:13,520
stock max that's probably the best one

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,170
that they sell that stands about three

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,690
and a half almost four foot top of the

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,300
spool on top yeah that is my workhouse

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,880
workhorse printer I used the RO stock

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,770
for a lot of different things and then

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
they have this boss tilt on the right

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,240
that's not a joke folks that thing is

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,160
five foot tall now these guys are kind

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,630
of funny they bought I wish I was there

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,330
but - one of the conference's they

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:38,300
brought a working is either 12 or 15

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,790
foot Delta printer and it was amazing to

00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,059
watch watch it work they even made one

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:46,220
that prints some ceramic so they're

00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,960
really out there as far as pushing the

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,150
envelope what to do but if you need a

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,470
big format printer that's that boss

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,610
Delta that's gonna do the trick

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,870
and then there's manner hackers I

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,580
mentioned that they are in Southern

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,040
California they sell just about

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,110
everything 3d print really including the

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,270
books to go with them so if you want a

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:09,740
one-stop shop that's your matter hackers

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,210
so it's a full-service experience you

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,669
get the whole purchasing experience

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,900
getting parts building whatever you need

00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:18,390
they're there though answer

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,950
on their form you could send them email

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,890
you can call them up and talk directly

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,110
to the guy I've talked with them there

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,860
they're really really good you know and

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:30,270
they know their stuff so a lot of the

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,760
help materials blogs and whatnot that

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,830
you see you go to matter hackers they

00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,840
they really cut through the chat and

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,010
they'll tell you the straight deal you

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,650
don't see a lot of that voodoo stuff

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,970
that I'm talking about in fact they

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,140
don't even sell hairspray on their

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,140
website that's a good thing

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,909
so what about use 3d printers well right

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,030
is there a market for use 3d printers it

00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:57,210
turns out there is most of which is are

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:00,000
usually a junk shop okay that's like

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,100
looking for a cathode ray based TV you

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,419
know you know finding one that's going

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,400
to work well it's pretty low at this

00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,260
point

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,490
but the problem is is that those gems

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,190
that you find the ones that are really

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,929
worth buying are overpriced most people

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,500
were asking eighty percent of what they

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,230
paid for

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,470
because as particularly Americans have

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,880
this sense that if I paid $2,500 for it

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,429
a year later it ought to be worth nearly

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,799
as much you know no that doesn't work

00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:29,429
that way in the 3d printing industry I

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:32,010
can tell you 25 to 33 percent pure lucky

00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:34,260
if to sell your printer so that's why I

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,059
still have five printers I'm not going

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,740
to give them away although I have given

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,909
them in the way I should say so if

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,110
someone's really interested in 3d

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,030
printing is in there a friend or

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,270
extended family remember something like

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,880
that

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,330
I usually eventually give them their 3d

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,970
printer

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:51,780
it also helps they don't call me every

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,980
five minutes yeah but so you shouldn't

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,039
pay more than twenty-five to thirty

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,840
three percent and also consider 3d

00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,419
printers I would for ones that you can

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,039
upgrade so the kinds of upgrades you can

00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,230
do or like wooden frames can be

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,590
substituted with steel or aluminum

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,710
frames better friends for more rigidity

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:12,270
access mechanisms the x y&z axis can be

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,030
chained upgraded to smoother

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,309
higher precision product components get

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,740
rid of drive lash and all that build

00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,419
plates again that's another area that

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,630
you can change really easy actually

00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,770
heater upgrades are easy to change

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,679
extruders obviously going to want to

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,860
change that an electronic force now at

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,899
one point there were

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,419
mystical electronic board that only one

00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:36,909
worked now there's probably half a dozen

00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:39,159
or so that worked very well and the big

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:42,429
four years ago the big thing was whether

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,889
it was 16-bit or 32-bit I think most are

00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:45,960
now 32-bit that just means speed it

00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:48,940
doesn't have anything to do with

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,320
computational processing see because by

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,710
the way the ones run with the old

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,059
Arduino they still work this you know

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,019
they heard we know would run it no

00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,389
problem

00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,860
Arduino didn't have Wi-Fi you didn't

00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,239
have Bluetooth capability and all that

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,299
and that's what some of these 32-bit

00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:06,549
boards add for you but the best tip is

00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:11,470
look for one with a solid reliable frame

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:12,700
like a one that's you maybe somebody

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,289
knows what they're doing

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,499
something you know but it's a good that

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:18,820
took care of it that kind of thing and I

00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,989
can give you all kinds of tips if you're

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,639
interested for what to look for

00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:23,529
specifically there are some things to

00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:25,389
look for like when you buy a used car

00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:27,999
and it's got 5,000 miles on it but the

00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:29,739
tires are ball that should raise it'd be

00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:31,299
a great flag right well it's just like

00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:32,710
3d printers they tell you oh it's got

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,480
about 20 hours on it you look at the

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,539
extruder and it's got it and it's all

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,399
kicked up with burnt plastic 20 hours

00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:43,149
really is that all you pretty are you

00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:45,309
sure you know that kind of thing so what

00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:47,499
are the best 3d printers I think the

00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:49,629
Lowell spot 3 use printers are good

00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,639
unless they've abused them they're

00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:53,739
pretty good like I say low spot often

00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:57,309
cells upgrade so if you buy a low is

00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:59,049
about mini not the mini plus you can buy

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,909
the parts to make it a mini plus that's

00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:02,769
really kind of thing for some research

00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,440
that's another one I already mentioned

00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:06,879
that ultimate offenders are good I use

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,769
one if they're taken care of

00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:10,720
although with the Ultima girl that's one

00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:13,480
of the ones that I always see people pay

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,840
2500 for they want a 1800 for two year

00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,429
old 3d printer yeah don't do that you've

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,340
really got to have one go ahead but and

00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:24,009
then the older MakerBot's the MakerBot

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,899
replicator 2 I think is a better printer

00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:28,779
than the MakerBot replicator or

00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:30,639
replicator plus a replicator 2 can be

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,769
upgraded I'm of great mind and

00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:36,249
considerably upgraded to act

00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:37,869
access mechanisms the build plate and

00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,580
all kinds of things with that the whole

00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:41,259
thing I haven't upgraded are the actual

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,330
stepper motors themselves in the frame

00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:46,300
so you can upgrade those those

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:49,450
printers I'm have a replicator one still

00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:52,000
that I use that works very well CBC and

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,160
cero stock printers same way now they

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,870
make upgrade kits for previous ones but

00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,050
if you like buy a row stock max version

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,900
two today they used one the run version

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:04,300
for you may have to buy two a big kiss

00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,980
to get you where you want to go but yeah

00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,690
you could they still sell the upgrade

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,600
kits and if you call them they're

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,460
reasonable they're they're a C&C shot so

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,350
when you call them you get the guy that

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,140
does tell the CNC stuff for the frames

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,420
and whatnot and you say hey I got a v2

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,130
used when I'd like to upgrade the this

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,410
Saturday oh you need to buy this that

00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,790
the other thing yeah that kind of thing

00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,540
so they're they're interesting to talk

00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:30,160
to older well-engineered Prusa i3

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,680
printers or the build your own kind of

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,260
thing they're fine as long as they're

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,830
good quality watch out for ones made

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,950
with plastic or acrylic frames those are

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,960
not good generally some folks have swore

00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,330
by honest and then they get really good

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,460
quality out of them but that plastic

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,200
movement around Washington printer

00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,100
jiggle while it's running and that's not

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,410
for me

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:57,160
beware of shipping containers if you buy

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,840
a 3d printer it is a an instant

00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,990
engineering piece of engineering

00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,870
equipment it's very sensitive to

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:06,250
movement yeah so if you buy use 3d

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,530
printer make sure it comes with its

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,680
original shipping container so if you're

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,300
buying a used DIY printer you know are

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,550
they gonna do Stefan in a big boss throw

00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,320
some newspaper around it believe me I've

00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,690
seen them arrive like that and I've also

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,200
seen them destroyed that way so be

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,660
careful with that so some more notes on

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,020
upgrading your 3d printer so this is one

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:31,240
of the areas I wanted to tell you about

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:33,280
people people get wrong and then they

00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,810
they get their 3d printer and they talk

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,100
about folks think I'm the conference or

00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,360
whatever they hear some things about

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,310
this and they read about the new

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,900
extruder or whatever so they go out and

00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,120
they buy the new bill plate a new

00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,860
extruder the new belts and new pulleys

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,340
and they've all put it on their printer

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,470
and they fire it up and nothing works

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,750
don't do that it's like software change

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,480
one thing at a time

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,520
evaluate it and then and and go on from

00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,830
there so avoid the latest

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,780
most perfect dis upgrad thingy that

00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,910
everybody has to have they're usually

00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,010
aren't all that in fact they usually I'm

00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:09,010
not going to work for you one thing at a

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:11,140
time okay so areas of advancement here

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,270
areas that we've seen advancement in the

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,850
last ten years the hot and cold an

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,490
extruder access mechanicals have become

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,240
tighter the gears and match to the if

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,100
it's belt driven

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,840
gears masters have belt better so

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:28,450
there's less lag smoother running

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,370
bearings smoother rods that kind of

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,580
thing build plates different types of

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,860
materials there's glass metal this

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:38,740
spring steel there's all kinds of new

00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,600
carbon fiber different kinds of

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,840
treatment Lobot use a different type

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,730
altogether leveling yeah this is this is

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,080
one of those terms that don't make a lot

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,910
of sense because there's no such thing

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,530
as leveling you're not leveling the

00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,560
printer like putting a ball a bubble

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:55,030
level on it level means tramming what

00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,220
you're making sure is that all the

00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,840
access move perfect ninety degrees to

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,420
each other that's what that means

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,930
some Turner's buildable themselves or

00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,940
tram themselves okay that's really cool

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,250
and that's one of the new ones one of

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,320
the biggest ones of late is failed print

00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,660
restart so if you're printing something

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,620
and it's it's it's 30 centimeters tall

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,150
it's a big thing

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,530
you get two-thirds the way through it

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,140
and something happens you ran out of

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,720
filament power goes out whatever what

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,190
happens it used to be yeah snapped it

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,100
off you cleaned the flight build and you

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,620
started over but the new foreigners like

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,660
the proofs of research will be able to

00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,040
restart and the see me see me see and

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,800
seek and restart and some of the

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,810
software that you could buy or have open

00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,080
source like the matter control it's open

00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,760
source

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,100
they have features to allow you to

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,080
restart some of it requires measuring

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,280
the part to figure out where it was if

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,410
the printer doesn't have that capability

00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,160
but if the printer has the capability

00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,440
remember where it was

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,500
it can resume rightful work where it

00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,360
failed so it's very nice well I find

00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,340
connectivity you might not think it's a

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,840
big deal but if you're printing

00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,790
something it's going to take six hours

00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,400
and you started in the morning it's

00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:06,430
really easy to forget it's going and

00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,900
turn off your computer yeah that you're

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,440
secure yeah a direct connection you got

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,610
to have it

00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,830
sending codes to the printer

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:15,340
whole time over Wi-Fi you can let it run

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,900
and ignore it some of the printers like

00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,610
the MakerBot printers have cameras in

00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,470
them so you can actually watch it remote

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,120
you can go on the ones at the store go

00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,309
on to work and check it and that's it go

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,860
along or whatever although that's not a

00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:30,700
good idea to leave a 3d printer alone by

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:33,940
itself in your home why think about it

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:37,570
on average 230 degrees centigrade heat

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,640
at the hot end you know what if

00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,809
something were to fall into the bill

00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,309
plate or something that's flammable

00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,990
would it catch fire

00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:46,750
well the printer itself catch fire

00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,600
answer is yes I've seen it it's not

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,190
pretty so be careful its treated like it

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,730
what it is it's a it's a piece of

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:57,010
industrial equipment better surface

00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,100
treatments again let's ignore the Voodoo

00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,419
parts but tooless part removals so it

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,220
used to be when you had your party a

00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,410
print it wonderful it's great and then

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,910
you had risk breaking it getting off the

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,980
build plate because it stuck so well to

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,200
the mill plate and some treatments today

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,190
or like that but to list means you could

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,389
take it off without having to

00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,340
disassemble your printer

00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,679
it used to be yet to disassemble your

00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,909
printer partly to take the part off and

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,290
then you put it back together you had to

00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:23,020
retrain everything before you print

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:25,389
again to Lissa eliminates that problem a

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,669
better exotic filament support that's

00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,020
interesting we print now with flexible

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:32,740
filaments are going to print a new soul

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,450
for your shoe you can but you have to

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,909
make sure your extruder can handle that

00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:39,570
not all extruders can handle certain

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:42,100
types of material I have wood filament

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,750
so I can print things that actually look

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,869
like wood and what's really cool is it

00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,520
changes the temperature of the the

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:50,350
nozzle temperature and make it look like

00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,270
wood grain so the higher it gets the

00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:54,399
darker is the cooler it's lighter it

00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,770
gets it's really really cool you print

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,390
little trinkets you know little bunnies

00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,950
a little owls or something like that it

00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,840
looked like they're made out of wood you

00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,740
can sand them and stain them that's

00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:09,190
really cool stuff I have so carbon fiber

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,420
and embedded filament that I use for

00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,140
parts that are going to be under a lot

00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,430
of stress it's very strong part it's

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,800
brittle so at some point you will

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:20,500
actually break but it's very very strong

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,450
nylon is another example and a whole

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,920
host of exotic materials

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,570
but if you want to print some of those

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,100
you've got to make sure that your

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,830
printer you're buying either can be

00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,200
upgraded to print that material or you

00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:34,000
can print it out of the box Prusa is one

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,640
of the ones that offers an option to

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,790
print some of those or an extruder to

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,650
print some of those exotic filaments

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,390
better quality nozzles it used to be

00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,460
that when you bought a nozzle it was a

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,980
little brass nozzle looked like a nozzle

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:52,090
out of a carburetor and they were

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:55,390
quality wood okay but now we have much

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,040
more harder material nozzles they even

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,960
make a nozzle that has a ruby in the

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,230
bottom of it with a precision hole

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,200
drilled through that and that's to

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:08,380
control the heat distribution and of

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,780
course surface treatments the prize for

00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,700
misunderstanding the most misunderstood

00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,380
and voodoo-like experience is surface

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:18,010
treatments there's all kinds of goop

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,620
agents potions and various liquids that

00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,080
you can make parts stick to your print

00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:25,390
surface for easy removal all kinds out

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,040
there some people like I say have near

00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,600
religious experience with some of them

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,750
and they're convinced nothing else will

00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,300
work some like me usually have a myth

00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,760
experience with most of it and I'll tell

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,950
you of my five printers I have five

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,750
different surface treatments because

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,610
each printer with the type of material I

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:45,400
use on it it's a little difference

00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:48,010
somehow glass build place some I use

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,930
built a con some have flexible spring

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:53,380
steel that I cover with Captain date

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,880
some with glass with blue tape it all

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,470
work whatever works best for your

00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,160
printer so for example the Delta

00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:05,080
printers the RO stocks glass with blue

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,460
painters tape that's the best for me for

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,650
you if you have one it might be

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,450
different I've got several megabots

00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,730
most of the older ones one of them has

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:15,310
I've upgraded to a removable bill plate

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:17,710
that's glass that thing with captain

00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:19,270
tape one will print abs perfectly every

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,640
time always sticks to the bill plan

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,220
always easy come off by print anything

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,440
else on it I've got to retool it so I've

00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,480
got one printer that I do ABS it works

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,050
great leave it alone

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,980
another MakerBot I use buildtak works

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,420
great

00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,400
another MakerBot that I use build tax

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,170
printer doesn't work very well there's

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,910
something really peculiar about the

00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:43,000
extruder in that particular one that's

00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,440
one of the newer models by the way so

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,650
your mileage may vary you're going to

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:53,390
have to experiment don't forget that

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,309
that stuff that you squirt or paint on

00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,950
your surface is only half the equation

00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:59,270
right so you may read about ABS slurry

00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,859
if you're going to print with ABS ABS

00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:03,680
slurry is just taking a little bit ABS

00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:05,210
and diluting it in acetone and creating

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,309
it something you can paint on like a

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:11,660
like a varnish kind of thing and it

00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:15,290
works really really well but ABS slurry

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,910
won't work for PLA yeah it's not

00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,650
designed for that it doesn't work that

00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,799
way won't work the wood filament or the

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,329
flexible filament and so on and so forth

00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:25,309
make sure what you're using it using it

00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:27,230
for the right reason with the right

00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:28,460
surfaces so if you've got a surface

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,770
treatment you want to try out make sure

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,049
you research it find out whether it's

00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,430
made to be used on glass or whether it's

00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:39,619
made to be used on top of tape okay

00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,599
experiment with them you know try it out

00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:44,030
yourself if you're starting to think of

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,200
this is gonna take a lot of time you're

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:49,280
starting to get the hint of what I'm

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,250
going to talk about at the end so for

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,220
example buildtak with PLA buildtak is a

00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,170
flexible material it's got you sticks to

00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:01,339
your bill plate and you could put it on

00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:04,760
there and it works best with PLA and my

00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:06,650
MakerBot and proofs are clones but it's

00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,010
horrible with my delta printers it just

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,559
doesn't work that well and there's lots

00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:15,530
of reasons for that I won't get into but

00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,480
here's the real secret what you need I

00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,299
don't care what the solution is even if

00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,410
it is one of those voodoo hairspray kind

00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:22,849
of things that has to come from a

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,130
particular salon if that works for you

00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:27,109
the goal is to make sure the first layer

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,780
of your print sticks to your build plate

00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:32,180
and does not come off except when you

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,069
want it to that's the trick

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:38,299
whatever solution you can get figure out

00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:40,280
that works that way for you use it so I

00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,920
might look at it funny go your build a

00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,690
hairspray okay that's cool but if it

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,400
works for you that's great just don't

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:51,049
preach it like it's the best solution in

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:54,589
the world okay promise me that usually

00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,000
they these things people do will help

00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:58,190
they make suggestions are very helpful

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,010
out there but they usually make it worse

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,180
so a lot of people yes oh you see my

00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,569
prints are not sticking to the bill

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,670
plate well just raise the temperature

00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:11,299
well the bill plate or the nozzle they

00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:14,660
say yes it's not helpful then I usually

00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:18,710
make it worse actually okay

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:21,349
I'm not done yet so another tip that you

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,480
can use is to use a raft what's a raft a

00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:26,210
raft is this layer that the printer

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,280
prints down and usually doesn't it very

00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,680
coarsely so it's made designed to be

00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,140
bigger than your part and then and it

00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,750
builds up over time several layers

00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,359
usually thicker layers and then at the

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,670
top it prints a very fine surface and

00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:43,520
the idea is if your part will stick to

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:45,170
that very fine surface now some 3d

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,780
printing software makes a better raft

00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,660
another believe it or not the MakerBot

00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,250
software makes the best raft because you

00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:55,430
can go to the part when it's done and

00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:57,829
pop it right off getting a raft off the

00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:01,040
build plate is a different story but

00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:03,530
it's done its job the matter control

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,510
makes decent one cure makes a decent one

00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,880
but some of the other software makes a

00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:10,280
raft that becomes part of the part and

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,589
I've actually had to take it the part

00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,630
off and go in there with a fine exacto

00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:20,270
sawed and sawed off the raft that's

00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,280
mission failure guys don't do that but

00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,510
if you spent six hours running apart and

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,740
you can get the raft off what we're

00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:30,079
gonna do so again experiment with that

00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:32,150
but be careful to strong a bond whatever

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,770
whether using whereafter or not can

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,970
damage the print service now if you're

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,440
using blue tape

00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,880
blue painters tape know whether blue

00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,470
paper painter's tape is right

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,420
everybody's seen that right they also

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,910
have green painters tape and yeah

00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,250
meaning yellow don't work all sticks of

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:49,369
glass well enough it might stick to a

00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,290
wood plate it might stick to other types

00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:52,880
of material like a plexiglass plate but

00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,359
it does not stick to glass very well

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,789
only the

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,160
sticks well to class again your mileage

00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:00,259
may vary you may find green painter's

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,319
tape that works great for you some of

00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:04,940
the masking tape works great blue tape

00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:06,739
works best for me because blues tape

00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,900
stick swells the glass and the part

00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:11,509
sticks to the blue tape I can also find

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,650
blue tape that is 12 inches wide which

00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,630
is really cool

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,940
except when you're printing small parts

00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,230
right you pull it out and you put it on

00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,460
the build plate and you print this part

00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,220
that's this big around and you pull it

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,720
off and you tear it gonna take the whole

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,210
thing off and throw it away so if you

00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,489
use the 2 inch wide right and you print

00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,170
a small part and you tear it not a

00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:31,849
problem you pull that one strip out you

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,299
put another one down on top see trade

00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:38,660
offs think about those kind of things

00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:40,910
also the filament itself I've had spools

00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,249
of filament that work great with certain

00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,410
builds treatments worse build surface

00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:47,989
stress and from the same manufacturer

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,329
other roles that don't so I've got some

00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:52,549
from MakerBot that I've got a sticker on

00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:55,849
the side says you must run this at two

00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:57,859
and thirty other ones say 215 other ones

00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:00,170
say only works with blue painters tape

00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:02,299
you have to experiment you don't want to

00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:05,299
throw those out those rolls of filament

00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:06,650
can be like 50 60 bucks right can throw

00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,210
them out so but if once you figure out

00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,460
what works with them you're fine now not

00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,019
all of them are like that generally like

00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,880
you buy from MakerBot or a matter

00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:15,680
hackers and you figure out works best

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,029
whether you buy more it's usually the

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,039
same settings you really don't have a

00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:21,410
problem every once in a while you run

00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:24,170
into it with MakerBot it's almost always

00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,269
the yellow PLA there's something about

00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,119
the yellow PLA filament from MakerBot

00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:30,680
that it's just not stable I think but

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,259
that's my experience yeah you know you

00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,440
may have different so what about this

00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:39,230
filament you come in generally two sizes

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,849
1.75 millimeter or 3 millimeter whatever

00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,140
your printer uses is what you're going

00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:44,539
to have to use now the reason why I

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,609
don't have a Ulta maker or Lowe's bodies

00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:50,569
they both use 3 millimeter filament and

00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:52,999
all of my printers use 1.75 I can

00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:54,769
convert them if I want to but keep that

00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:56,390
in mind you know if you pick one if

00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,799
you're not necessarily stuck with it but

00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,839
if you have a huge investment if you

00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:02,539
have a rainbow set of colors in your

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:05,100
cabinet and you decide you want to get 3

00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:07,020
millimeters that 1.75

00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,720
filaments not good to you anymore so

00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,240
think about that there is a wide range

00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,880
of filament materials available stock on

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,440
hands 10 tends to ebb and flow even

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,800
madder hacker sometimes are out of

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,660
certain types of filament just be aware

00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,890
that if you're doing something a special

00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,390
project or something make sure you order

00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:29,700
it ahead of time and I think in general

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,500
we need better filament handling

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,960
capabilities so actually loading the

00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,120
filament knowing when the filament is

00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,280
real is low although some printers have

00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,460
that capability that could that could be

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,660
helpful you know joining a filament you

00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,940
know usually when they run out of

00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:48,870
filament you have to take the remainder

00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:51,360
out reloaded possibly prime the printer

00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:54,270
and research your part or resume your

00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,010
part that procedure could be a lot

00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,570
better I think I think it really needs

00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,720
to get to the point how serious and why

00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:02,730
can't that your printer goes ding and

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,560
you put new filament in it you've pushed

00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,780
a button you know cell flows and goes

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,860
the MakerBot printer is one of the

00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,690
reasons they went to the extruder they

00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,020
have as they they claim and it does that

00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,420
I'm here to tell you that it works

00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:18,750
sometimes but usually not so good they

00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,940
need some more work aesthetics

00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,490
oh this is one of my pet peeves consumer

00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,790
printers some consumer printers are

00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,890
designed to look nice so if anybody

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,260
heard of a dremel printer Dremel like

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,330
the dremel tool they make a printer that

00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,890
the outer case looks wonderful and there

00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,270
are other types of printers I should

00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,040
have put some pictures on there I don't

00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:41,130
want to embarrass anybody they look

00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,870
great on the outside but on the inside

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,350
maybe not so much they spent too much

00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,940
time on aesthetics so I a lot of them

00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,890
looks like something you'd find it Best

00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,980
Buy or Target you know like it looks

00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,540
like the glossy kind of thing and I

00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,790
guess I'm too old-school I like to see a

00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,850
machine it's a robot right I want to

00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:02,580
look like a robot professional printers

00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:04,350
tend to be more utilitarian and some

00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,230
people like ultimate or MakerBot make a

00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,370
fairly fancy looking one but see me see

00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,170
and see if you remember the delta

00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:12,780
printers i mean they look like a tool

00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,000
yes that's exactly what they are so i

00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,300
tend to shy away from that but again

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,740
whatever you like that's great

00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,680
it's I don't like ones that require

00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,170
different to size screwdrivers and all

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,030
that to work on you know I prefer one

00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:31,180
that I could work on with a single set

00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:33,460
of tools but it's a sad reality as a

00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,620
consumer great business for instance if

00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,560
you need to fix your iPhone right how

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,990
many people have had to fix your iPhone

00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,850
and they fix their own iPhone ok that's

00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,160
a lot of work isn't it the thing is not

00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,860
made to come apart you can get it apart

00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,570
is not made to come apart MakerBot's the

00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,300
same way not so much the ultimate guy

00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:54,160
you can't those work on those MakerBot

00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,600
there are a lot of screws hidden behind

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,620
those panels and when you're trying to

00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,630
pop them home it's kind of like telling

00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,010
the panels off in your car or you break

00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:02,080
three of the tabs off when you're trying

00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,340
to get it off that's how the MakerBot's

00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,440
are so if you want a printer this you

00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,950
want to be able to work on you might

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,270
reconsider that MakerBot yeah so that's

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,620
a little pet peeve yet all right so what

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,830
what can we do to get the most out of

00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,630
our 3d printer well we have to realize

00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:19,360
that owning and operating a 3d printer

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:22,150
requires time effort and patience with

00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,790
underlying patience three times you need

00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:27,130
a lot of patience don't try to chase the

00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:29,470
perfect printer with money I think well

00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,020
if I just bought that $3,000 Alta maker

00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:35,770
I wouldn't have this problem with that

00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:38,050
thousand dollar Prusa false you may have

00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:41,920
worse problems because the credit card

00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:43,420
bill may come next week alright so don't

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,640
try to chase that the less expensive

00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,920
models sometimes I'll perform the more

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,110
expensive printers not always but

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,940
sometimes they do I mentioned the print

00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,100
speed here's the dish with Prince Pete

00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,020
it's a huge trade-off if you want

00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,000
something to print quick you have to

00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,530
print it fairly density you know fairly

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,690
dense in the words the layers have to be

00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:04,840
fairly thick the thicker the layers are

00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:07,930
the more rough the image looks or the

00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,300
the part looks the finer you want it to

00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,980
lower the print layer the better the

00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,240
part looks it's still going to have that

00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,860
striated you're still going to see

00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,850
layers but you won't see it from a

00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,800
certain distance

00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,230
okay so if you look at the picture on

00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,410
the front of my book it looks like a

00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,300
fairly well printed part if you get

00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,110
close you can see some of the striations

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:30,530
but that's a friend on a medium level

00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,720
thing but

00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:35,150
preying on high resolution could take

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,620
many times more I could take you six

00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,450
seven eight hours to print something

00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,510
about a low-resolution and only take it

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:44,690
45 minutes so you have to balance that

00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:46,270
trade-off and perform regular

00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,890
maintenance I can't stress that enough

00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,060
maintain your printer adjust it whatever

00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,230
it needs to be just think what never

00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,420
needs to be all over them or needs to be

00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:57,020
cleaned make sure you do that these are

00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,610
very finicky systems they can cause all

00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,980
kinds of problems if you don't do proper

00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:03,320
maintenance all right so what does it

00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,660
take become proficient again learn and

00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,490
understanding capabilities of the 3d

00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,170
printer you've bought what Philip my

00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,030
materials was a design to you what do

00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:13,490
you want to use with it what is the

00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:16,100
print speed what is the quality that it

00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:17,660
they they expect check the internet

00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,990
forums see what other peoples are

00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:23,360
experiencing with these things work with

00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,580
your printer often use a systematic

00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,570
approach to solving problems fix one

00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,880
thing at a time

00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:30,620
verifying but they move on same kind of

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,920
thing and did I mention you should

00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:37,250
maintain your printer let's look at some

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,660
examples um poor first layer heejun in

00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,610
other words the it won't stick to the

00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,920
build plate the part lives that gets

00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,150
knocked off after a while or appears to

00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,860
be what now the reason why it's knocked

00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:48,350
off is because the part itself usually

00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:51,380
warps and the printhead comes by and

00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:54,170
hits it and snaps it off usually don't

00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,850
see that until well into the print so

00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,500
the problem is the first layer is losing

00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,690
even their parts not sticking to the

00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:02,570
build plate what can you do there's a

00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:04,430
long list of things to do here now this

00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:06,170
is not a do this first kind of list

00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,270
these are the areas that you could

00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,400
explore things like cleaning your print

00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:12,530
service and you'll be surprised how many

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,540
times I've gone in and seeing a print

00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,310
service that is just hardly pitted when

00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,100
I was like do you really expect the

00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,350
having to stick to that lowering the

00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,210
first layer height so first their height

00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:27,440
most people set to be whatever layer

00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:29,480
they want like 0.3 1/2 that make sure

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,170
you squish that filament down onto the

00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,970
print service turn off your fans for the

00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,800
first of using filament that requires

00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,690
cooling turnable for the first few

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,040
layers increasing the temperature the

00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,170
build plate can sometimes help

00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,960
increasing the temperature of the nozzle

00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,480
can help

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,890
you know ad for the first few layers

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,690
slowing print speed on the first layer

00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:51,599
and that one works more often than not

00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:55,140
just half the speed you know really slow

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,270
and then resume it use a raft okay if

00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,770
you're the print surface will handle a

00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:03,569
raft well and your software will

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:04,920
generate one well use that probably had

00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:06,900
to last near the bottom

00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,329
look at those alternative surface

00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,280
treatments but more importantly think

00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:13,079
about your environment if you've got

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,390
your 3d printer stuck next to an open

00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:16,020
window and you're having a heejun

00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:19,770
problems

00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:22,950
close the window okay or you've got it

00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:25,859
set like underneath an HVAC system right

00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:27,420
move it because all those extra air

00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:28,829
currents the temperature changes are

00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,180
going to affect that printer is very

00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:33,240
sensitive to that kind of stuff

00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:36,569
room fans turn along those kind of

00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,910
things here's another one stringing this

00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:40,559
is very very common so you get the part

00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,690
and let's say it's a complex part it has

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,579
different you know I don't know nodules

00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:45,960
or whatever and then what you get it out

00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:47,849
and looks great except there's strings

00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,099
from various points and this gets it's

00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:52,109
like it's fuzz on it and that happens a

00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:54,809
lot sometimes they're called threads it

00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:57,390
happens when the nozzle lifts off of one

00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:58,980
part it moves to the other the filament

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,740
is still dripping if you will and it

00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,900
causes a string okay how do you fix it

00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,420
well as a number of thing lowering the

00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:10,280
temperature of the nozzle is the exact

00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:12,480
opposite of the surface first layer

00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,119
increasing fan speed to cool the

00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,579
filament faster slowing the print speed

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,380
helps changing the size of your nozzle

00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,660
can help to match the whatever you're

00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,400
trying to doing and calibrating your

00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,619
extruder a lot of times stringing is

00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,660
caused because you're over extruding

00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:30,270
you're putting too much filament out at

00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:33,089
one time yes you do have to calibrate

00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:35,190
your extruder and it calop the formula

00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:38,250
for calibrating your extruder includes

00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:41,130
the size of the filament so that's an

00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:43,260
interesting thing to do under extrusion

00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,880
that maybe you're printing apart I

00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,770
talked to someone who was trying to

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,140
print a whistle and this the walls of

00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,390
the whistle were too thin and that's

00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,920
under extrusion so it doesn't form a

00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:56,730
good solid or doesn't it doesn't form a

00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,859
you know a solid

00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,720
so how do you fix it increasing the flow

00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:02,550
rate of the extruder is not extruding

00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,680
enough but lowering the nozzle

00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,690
temperature can sometimes help raising

00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,980
it if it's getting clogged there's

00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,780
enough that's a different issue so

00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,660
sometimes under extrusion can lead to

00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,880
clogs so it just stops extruding all

00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,970
together that's a case where you got the

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,570
temperature perhaps too low calibrating

00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:23,660
your extruder will do that same thing

00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:26,730
okay so tips and tricks for 3d printing

00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,349
most I can't stress this enough

00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,420
the number one thing you could do to

00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:32,490
help yourself is to make sure your

00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,589
nozzle is set at the right height to

00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,359
start with so these two photographs the

00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:37,950
one on the Left shows a properly

00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:40,140
adjusted one the one on the right shows

00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,820
an improperly it has two one what you

00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,700
want to do in this this sounds like

00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,579
voodoo okay let you take a typical sheet

00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:49,320
of paper not your high quality a resume

00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:50,460
type printer with all the threads and

00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,440
all that just a very got a piece of

00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:56,010
notebook paper then people use yellow

00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:58,410
post-it notes okay and you lower the you

00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:01,619
set your print nozzle height to where

00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:03,720
the nozzle just touches the paper and

00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:05,640
you can pull it out and push it under

00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,560
now not so much that you can easily do

00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,720
it and that's so much that you really

00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,790
have to pull to get it out that's a very

00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:15,230
sensitive kind of thing but here's the

00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:17,970
trick do it when your nozzle is clean

00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:19,560
okay you got some filaments that are

00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,599
dripping out and they always do after a

00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,060
print clean that off and make sure

00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,440
that's a clean nozzle right and make

00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,780
sure you did over the clean nozzle the

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,599
other thing is your that's part of the

00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,040
procedure to tram your bill plate so

00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:33,839
you're going to have to do it when you

00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,900
try on your build plate why not do it at

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,760
the same time right so you're gonna want

00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,300
to do that at multiple places on your

00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,680
build surface not just the center

00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,280
because the build plate could be concave

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,220
or convex and that Delta printer that I

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,560
like a lot it has a problem it's convex

00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:54,660
so there's there's not exact center but

00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,950
it's like it and one quarter is a little

00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,640
higher than the other and I had to

00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,410
adjust for that

00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,760
it's the glass that's what it's a

00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,770
different the glass that's not perfectly

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,349
flat that's another myth in 3d printing

00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:07,940
glass is always perfectly flat wrong

00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:10,440
what is glass any physics what's glass

00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,839
it's a liquid yeah

00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:17,010
there are some types of glass like or

00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:19,109
silly yeah it's a chemical that like

00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:20,849
Pyrex that's made out of that they form

00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:23,280
and that with machines and make it very

00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:25,589
flat but even then some of those can be

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,920
a little but regular glass isn't

00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:31,890
generally not flat

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,420
check your nozzle temperatures look at

00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:34,530
the manufacturer of your filament and

00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,089
see what they recommend for the

00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,849
temperature of the nozzle now that's a

00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:40,020
recommendation okay they they don't know

00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,609
what printer you're going to use it with

00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,920
but they know that it works best in

00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:45,150
general at that print range then matter

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,039
hacker gives you a range

00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,140
they don't necessarily give you one

00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,020
temperature try it out start in the

00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:54,599
middle of the range and see how it works

00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,740
when you get it set correctly you know

00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,650
it because your part will print

00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,099
consistently if it's if you're doing

00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:04,440
tall prints sometimes I like to print a

00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:05,880
small part beside it like a cylinder or

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,010
something like that and what that will

00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,260
do is give this printhead time to move

00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:13,010
and cool a little bit because taller

00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:16,289
prints were to higher print prints

00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,650
nozzle temperature may cause the top

00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:23,730
layers look melty kind of thing or

00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:25,559
string so you can work with that find

00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:27,230
the sweet spot for your bed temperature

00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:30,180
now this has to do with the type of

00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:32,069
surface that you have type of heater it

00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,180
has and the type of filament you're

00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:36,089
going to use as well as the print

00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,760
surface the surface treatment so some

00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:42,710
like PLA I run between 58 and 60 degrees

00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:45,359
centigrade ABS I run 115 degrees

00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:47,940
centigrade it just depends what you're

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:50,670
going to do if you get it too high the

00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,859
bottom of the print will flow out like

00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:55,619
this and they'll call what we call

00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:57,150
elephant feet and that's okay because it

00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:59,460
usually means it's gonna stick really

00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:02,099
good but if you really want a perfect

00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,720
print a perfectly perfect cube like a

00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:05,490
replica of the board cube or something

00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,380
and it has the elephant feet it doesn't

00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,910
look too good you have to cut them off

00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,079
or shave them off or saying them off or

00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:12,029
all that yeah so if you see elephant

00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,510
feet is usually an idea that your bed

00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:16,589
temperatures too high printer adjustment

00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:18,150
remember that tramming thing I was

00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:20,400
talking about well here's a graphic that

00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:23,309
illustrates what's what you're doing if

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,760
you have a z-axis in particular that

00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:27,060
uses

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:30,180
two motors like the person design they

00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:31,350
have to be together they can't be you

00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,360
know one higher than the other one

00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:36,090
running faster than the other believe it

00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,690
or not particularly for DIY eyes out

00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:42,510
there if you buy a matched set of motors

00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,430
stepper motors some of those different

00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,560
motors might run slightly faster

00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,570
slightly smaller slower than others

00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:55,020
a particularly if you buy commodity

00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:56,790
meaning from Asia in ten okay not Japan

00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:00,450
the Japanese different motors are very

00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:01,560
very precise so watch for those ones

00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,950
you've never heard of and can't

00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,450
pronounce but sometimes with like these

00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,640
these designs if they're not going

00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:11,010
exactly at the same time they can cause

00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,660
issues so a certain layers the one side

00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,670
or get higher than the other and you

00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,250
want to try to avoid that make sure all

00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:19,230
the bolts are tight and all the access

00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,430
mechanisms you know if you grab a hold

00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:25,400
of printer and shake it in something

00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,400
jingles it should never Dingle fix it

00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:31,200
patience is your greatest friend your

00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:32,370
patience will yield higher quality

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,250
prints that's the way it is just be

00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:37,740
patient work with it look at it as an

00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:39,540
experience so again I'm trying to take

00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,100
you as a hobbyist potentially and say

00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,230
you really ought to attack it like an

00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,420
enthusiast because that's where you'll

00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:49,050
get the best enjoyment and the best

00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:52,410
results faced with problems approach it

00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:54,750
with a systematic process to fix it and

00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:56,250
just remember every printer you print is

00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,860
an opportunity to learn more about your

00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:02,240
printer and having printed thousands of

00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,240
