Title: Randy Earl - Fail Early or Fail Large -  Embrace Negative Results
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
We will talk about spectacular failures, great successes and how to avoid the former and ensure the latter. We start with a multi-million dollar crash and end with a tank crew happily blowing things up. In between we talk about user testing principles and techniques my team has applied to open source application development. Whether you are developing a simple script to scratch an itch or are part of a large team working on a huge project, you can benefit from learning how to test the value of your idea as early as possible, saving time and money that can be invested in development of a concept you have validated with early testing.

Jing'an itch and that's great you know

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,910
scratching your own itch but then if you

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,440
want to share with others that sometimes

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,630
you start to realize other people don't

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,460
think about things the same way you do

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,740
and that's where my kind of group comes

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,560
in the experienced group so what I want

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,500
to talk about is is fail early or a fail

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,210
large means doing some testing in the

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,590
beginning before you want to share

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,439
things with somebody else can save you a

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:32,070
lot of heartache later on so how many

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,590
people remember this it's kind of an old

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,440
okay yeah an old example but there's a

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,420
reason so I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,910
in advance I'm gonna mix my metaphors a

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,610
little bit I worked for Lockheed so I

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,530
feel like I can use Lockheed examples so

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,850
you know if you say what does Software

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,410
have to do with some of these things

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,449
well just I'm broadly applying a

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,219
metaphor also it helps sometimes to step

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,289
back and look from a different

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,149
perspective so the Mars climate orbiter

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:06,720
was a fail in that it crashed into Mars

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,420
got all the way to Mars but then crashed

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,979
and the the root cause analysis found

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,890
that different teams were working on

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,990
different units you know one team was

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,290
using metric another was using Imperial

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,220
I didn't convert one way or the other so

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,759
that they matched up so nobody found the

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,400
problem in advance and that's what I

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,500
want to talk about it's finding problems

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,650
in advance before they become disasters

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,900
okay

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,729
now I didn't work on that Lockheed

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,759
project I was very happy that I didn't

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,189
work on that massive failure this is one

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,119
that I did work on the division of

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,880
Lockheed that I worked for built the

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,020
transmission system and the turret

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,579
stabilization systems anybody familiar

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,280
with the Bradley Fighting Vehicle had

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,170
all know what it is looks kind of like

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,570
maybe a tank it's not a tank

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,549
it's an infantry vehicle it's made to

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,920
carry troops into the field it's not

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:10,560
heavily armored it doesn't have a big

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,069
tank gun its defense is speed and it's

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,140
offense is to be able to fire at

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,879
because it's got a stabilized turret so

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,609
was it charging over Hill and Dale the

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,049
gun is stable on its target and I

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:25,159
realize I'm like pointing at somebody

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:26,900
like no I don't want to do that so but

00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,810
this is Linux Linux fest you know this

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,049
itself we like our um we like our are

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,280
things that go bang right so if we have

00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,319
time at the end we'll talk about that a

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,989
little bit more so that's a project that

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,489
I did work on okay and I found a problem

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,069
now that was my job

00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,650
I was in Quality Assurance I was a QA

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:51,260
engineer and I don't want to say big ish

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,129
I mean I found something that could have

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,659
become a disaster except that I found it

00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:58,699
and actually this is where software

00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,169
comes into play a little bit a lot of

00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:03,049
electronic testing is done through

00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:05,569
software driven testing I was reviewing

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,159
the program code and saying hey the

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,659
specification in here and the program

00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,030
code doesn't match the specification

00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:13,340
you're supposed to be testing too so I

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,000
was very proud of myself very happy with

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,919
myself I did my job really well so how

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,930
come everybody was unhappy with me I

00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,840
slowed down production I had killed the

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,150
budget that I'd put the vendor on report

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,739
you know everybody was unhappy with me

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:37,790
because I did my job now I think that's

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:40,069
partly because really it wasn't that

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,500
whether or not I did my job it's like

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,629
planning didn't do their job to plan in

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,939
time protesting plan in time for

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:48,620
failures and iteration and improvement

00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:52,819
and so on we'll talk about that a little

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,729
bit more but another aspect is that

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,379
people like positive results it's all

00:03:55,729 --> 00:04:01,159
unicorns and rainbows and everybody's

00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:07,099
happy everybody likes good news nobody

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:09,769
likes bad news okay and in my office I

00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:11,840
have this chart the cognitive bias codex

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,099
and this is like a hundred and eighty

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,479
and you're not meant to be able to read

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,169
that don't worry about that it's it's

00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:21,739
meant to show you that there are so many

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:23,570
biases that we have and bias can be a

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,430
good word or it could be a bad word the

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,660
reason that we can function as human

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,550
beings is because we are

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,890
pattern seeking and pattern recognizing

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,810
animals we automate so much of our

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,520
processing that we can get through the

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,280
day quickly as opposed to having to

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,980
think through everything from scratch

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,370
every time the bad part of that is

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,320
sometimes we fool ourselves with some of

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,070
the patterns that we use and one of the

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,220
most common ones is confirmation bias

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,320
okay

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,950
and we're all pretty much familiar with

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,800
that terminology this is where we over

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,250
value data that supports what we already

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:06,680
believe and we undervalue data that

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:08,210
disagrees with us okay so you end up

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,790
with situations like this we have a

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,440
designer talking to a product owner or a

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,660
user or something like that saying how

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,440
much do you love this thing I built you

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,690
know it's prejudicing the answer when

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,360
you ask questions in that swea and

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,030
that's why we never want developers

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,760
product owners designers things like

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:32,090
that being involved whatsoever in

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,550
testing and and I don't mean that in a

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,530
bad way whenever I've built something I

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,330
I like a pat on the back just as much as

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,060
anybody else right

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:46,250
you need an unbiased approach to

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,010
gathering feedback so the point that you

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,840
know they always say you should

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,730
summarize your presentation into one

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,070
takeaway there's nothing you take away

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,040
today it's like negative results can

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,169
save a project if you find them early

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,580
enough okay that's very important how

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:04,520
many of you have been involved in a

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,760
project that was a disaster right okay

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,860
how many of you made a warning yourself

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,150
knew that a warning had been given knew

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,280
that there were indicators that there

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,669
were going to be problems and they were

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,650
ignored yeah okay so you we all know

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,520
this intuitively but it is hard and

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,050
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,790
how that's hard in some ways and also

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,720
systematically going about getting that

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,520
kind of feedback that can help so in the

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,070
software world even if you're not in

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,950
design or user experience you know about

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,830
the phrase UX right we talked a lot

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,010
about user experience UX our user

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,240
experience research uxd design and so on

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,120
so we're familiar with that terminology

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,690
and what they do and that's very often

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,330
testing the interface can we understand

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,580
the logic flow the workflow the the

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,520
labels use and the navigation things

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,010
like that okay we what we don't talk

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,830
about as much is testing the validity of

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,500
the value proposition but I want to go

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:10,300
over two examples one of each and talk

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,940
about how how they can be very important

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,310
so the case study first to go over is

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,170
how to design and validate a user

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,720
interface and this could be an entire

00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,640
course and a long talk I'm gonna show

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,440
some kind of information dense slides

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,480
don't worry I don't necessarily intend

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,330
for you to absorb all the material there

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,660
so we're gonna go over this is for a

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,900
pharmacy school redesign okay

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,900
University you're targeting a young

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,120
audience a lot of people think a

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,820
tech-savvy audience is kind of what we

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,080
think of immediately about Millennials

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,550
or even younger than Millennials I don't

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,150
know what the next generation after that

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:55,400
is called but really they are so

00:07:50,150 --> 00:08:00,380
inundated with online systems and

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,720
digital interfaces that they jump to

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,420
pattern recognition faster than many of

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,750
us who are older so they are prone to

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,250
failure if the system does not behave as

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,460
they expect it to behave so it's

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,080
actually more important to design

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,740
properly for somebody who's facing that

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,930
kind of saturation so the kinds of

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,970
research questions we wanted to ask in

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,980
this case this is for a website not an

00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,380
application it was like how do how do

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,510
people group topics what's their mental

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,010
model for that how do you label things

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,500
so that they understand it and the

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,800
terminology they use think you know in

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,440
terms of medical care people who in this

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,910
room would typically think of cancer you

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,590
know whereas medical students think in

00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,790
terms of oncology right they're

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,970
referring to the same thing but

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,710
different terminology and design

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,870
usability and I'm gonna back up you

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,540
would not believe how many times if you

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,579
let people let professionals

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,750
right the content design the interface

00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:59,750
and stuff like that they'll use the

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,779
professional jargon that their users

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,670
won't understand necessarily so the

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,380
research methods we use to do that are

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,300
things called card sorts and you can

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,160
just think of index cards on a table I

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,800
mean we literally run them so that way

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,510
sometimes where you put out a bunch of

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,769
cards and ask people to group them in

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,600
ways that make sense to them there's

00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:22,029
online ways to do that we'll talk about

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,010
that tree testing is how you see how

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:28,940
well that work you ask people to follow

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,980
a tree a navigation tree to what you you

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,860
ask them to perform a task and you see

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,690
which tree branchings they take and then

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,760
a usability test just in terms of all

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,350
kinds of aspects of where do they where

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,850
do they go with the mouse where where do

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,620
they look on the screen those kinds of

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,470
things so a card sort I guess that's not

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,389
meant to be blacking out the face for

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,829
privacy that's just lack of contrast or

00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:54,829
whatever on the screen so that's a

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,480
moderated online session that's actually

00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,630
me they're doing this test with this

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,089
person so this is what we call a

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,889
generative activity you're not going to

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,839
find failures here this is where you are

00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:10,279
generating information about how people

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:13,490
think and we give them an online

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,260
interface these are basically cards and

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,910
they group them into categories and they

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,940
name categories and things like that so

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:23,329
you are seeing how they think how they

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,660
think things go together I had a client

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:28,459
one time that we were working with them

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,170
and he said well why do we need to do

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:31,579
this and I explained to him to

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,110
understand how people think about your

00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,660
product I know how people think about

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,699
our products we we built this industry

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,899
this industry didn't exist for 40 years

00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,209
we've been telling people how to think

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,620
about this and later the data showed him

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,209
he was labeling something as personal

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,420
care and people were searching on

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,519
hygiene you know so he may have done

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:54,470
this set this up 40 years ago but the

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,779
people have moved on without him so we

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,550
found that our participants in this

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,740
study kind of grouped things together

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,890
into similar categories and again this

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,300
isn't really to to tell you about this

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,640
particular case you don't really care

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:12,110
about this School of Pharmacy

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,300
or to become experts in testing it's I'm

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,700
building to a point so what they were

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,470
thinking along the same ways so far

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,490
which is good it makes it easier for you

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,130
you don't have to get really really

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,930
creative and imaginative so the results

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,330
were that we could plan logical sections

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,700
using the card sort and produce the

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,860
first draft of the website structure so

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,290
there were no real negative results here

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,840
because this was generative research not

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,660
evaluative not seeing how well people

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,390
performed to it but once we have that

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:46,240
first draft of a new site structure then

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:52,610
you can do the tree test that's where

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,650
you design some tasks you say ok we want

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,110
you to find this piece of information we

00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,060
want you to register for this event or

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,590
something like that and we might have a

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,360
mock-up a clickable mock-up and see how

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,820
they go through the system and in this

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,490
case we had like 68 participants took a

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,710
five-minute test and the nice thing is I

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,260
probably don't mention this - no this is

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,790
before a single line of code is written

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,970
because writing program code is

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,410
expensive you know very labor-intensive

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,050
some of these tests can be pretty quick

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,080
and easy and you find things before you

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,090
have to fix them if you went to the talk

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,700
next door where he was building his

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,770
small home you know after you've built

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,390
something changing it is much harder

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,330
than building it correctly in the first

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,910
place and we all know that now this is

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,790
where you can start finding things going

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,950
wrong so this is a case this is a real

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,620
one I didn't show you all the positive

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,240
ones the general results were very good

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,480
you know great good job

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,790
us right designing one but that's what

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,200
you hope for right but you need to pay

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,940
attention to the ones that go wrong in

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,580
this case we had like a fifty-four

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,430
percent failure rate they could not find

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,890
what the task had asked them to find 34

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,770
percent had a partial success partial

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,530
success meet means that they needed some

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,740
assistance where we had built in some

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:19,820
some contextual help or other guideposts

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,320
along the way so most users struggled to

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,570
find this target link for

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,310
this task and so we came up with a

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,860
recommendation to increase the

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:31,220
visibility of this particular topic and

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,260
how to get there so the results were

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,280
that it meant validated most of the card

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:40,970
sort however we did find a few tasks

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,980
failures so that but that's okay because

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,700
that allowed us to correct this before

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,850
we'd written any code actually before

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,680
finalizing the design so then we'd went

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,410
through the design process and then you

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,510
get to usability testing that's nice

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,820
when you've got high fidelity mock-ups

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,860
it looks exactly like the web screen the

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,010
web page is going to look it just it's

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,780
not functional you can do some image map

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:11,720
you know clicking for a click testing

00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:13,130
but no code so this was a test we came

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,130
up for them we were doing live remote

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,380
sessions using Google meat and it was

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,750
moderated meaning we had one of me or

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,730
one of my researchers working with them

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,130
listening to them and the test design

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,570
was that there are several steps here so

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,000
that we were doing that kind of first

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,590
impressions and I've just tell us what

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,780
does this page look like to you what are

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,690
the words that come to mind and then we

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,910
had the four specific tasks we asked

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,100
them to do then we had a little quick

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,450
survey after each task about was this

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,490
easy was this hard you've seen these

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,810
kinds of things on webpages right did

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,880
this page help you find the information

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,280
you were looking for those kinds of

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,310
things and then we had one post-test

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,670
survey with some broader questions it

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,590
was a little bit longer survey and then

00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,510
one post-test interview where the

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,640
moderator was asking questions and kind

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,130
of having an interactive discussion so

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,530
this allowed us to get qualitative

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,270
information as well as quantitative so

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,640
this was a well structured research

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:15,560
method we got a lot of information here

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,000
a long report and so you know in our

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,650
reports we list out a number of

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,720
participants in which groups they were

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,950
in which tasks they perform that kind of

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,380
stuff and we define the task this is

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,170
where I said we aren't going to go

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,230
through all the details this is an

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,270
example of the success and failure rate

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,760
and then the results of the

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,010
post task questionnaire and that was one

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,220
an example of one where we got a lot of

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:45,920
very positive results great again good

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,790
job us that's what what we hope for but

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,040
we did have some failures in group two

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,290
so here's another case where oops our

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,610
assumptions that we made regarding their

00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:00,680
behavior went wrong and this is where

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,690
you know this happens to all of us we

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,550
can't test what we build because we know

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,899
how it's supposed to work because we

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,800
built it the way we think it should work

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:13,339
right I'm gonna zoom by here work for

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,260
for Red Hat no so I can tell a story on

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:19,430
Red Hat okay they're one of our clients

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:22,700
so they built Red Hat connect if anybody

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,529
knows that so it's a way to if you're

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,720
building containers to have it certified

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,459
through their system and it was kind of

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
a portal so that you could log in and

00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:33,020
submit your your container and go

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,020
through the certification process the

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,060
workflow was so contorted that when

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,120
somebody registered for Red Hat Connect

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:44,089
they had a Red Hat engineer call him and

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,560
walk them through it because users

00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:47,060
couldn't figure out the path through it

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,709
by themselves and they brought us in to

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,260
help them get through that okay

00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:53,480
now red hats a big company made a lot of

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,899
money figuring out how to build software

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,790
to help people and still you know get

00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:02,120
wrapped up in their own mindset and

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,740
didn't understand how users would

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,370
approach that workflow so that can

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,990
happen it's it's not a criticism that's

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,689
why you need kind of an objective

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,270
third-party structured approach to

00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,069
finding these kinds of things and so the

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,339
ratings on the questionnaire were lower

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,510
as you would expect and so again you

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,579
don't need to read all these bullet

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,400
points the point is that we had a lot of

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,770
takeaways these were the validations

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,840
like again hey yes we did a good job we

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,000
thought we expected this behavior we saw

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,970
that behavior but then there were

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,250
takeaways that things that were problems

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,020
behaviors that we found that were not as

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,370
anticipated where people were getting

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:45,200
lost and so on so the results were that

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,960
we did if I identify clear needs for

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,990
development or for improvement

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,480
but again this was before changes could

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,889
be made before any code was written we

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,899
had completed the design so all we had

00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:00,549
to change was the design then we can

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:02,080
hand it over to the front-end developers

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:06,909
the back-end developers to write the

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,669
software so that's what we usually think

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:14,350
of testing the interface how will people

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:16,929
use our system okay but I would say

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:21,159
that's not enough and that's great yes

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,889
that's that's wonderful that works

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,480
really well for an existing product and

00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,950
even for a new product but for a new

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,539
product there's an additional thing you

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,240
need to test is like do people really

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,009
want this thing when you're producing

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,740
something new you're offering them a

00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:37,840
value proposition you're making an

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,669
assumption that they have a problem and

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,210
that you're providing a solution to

00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:45,009
their problem that will work for them

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,360
okay and that's a very important thing

00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:52,749
to test again back in my Lockheed days I

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,480
had worked for a quality director who I

00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:58,059
loved this he said a bad idea

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,600
beautifully executed it's still a bad

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:03,519
idea okay so you can do all that user

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,860
testing on the screen in terms of can

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,299
you follow the path and do they know

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,769
where to click and can they follow the

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,409
workflow and all that stuff but that

00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:12,999
says nothing about do they want to do

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:15,789
they have a reason to does it solve

00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:20,169
their problem so this is the second big

00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:26,409
thing that that I think everybody should

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:28,360
test so in this case study we work with

00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,129
North Carolina State University I'm in

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,850
Raleigh so they're very convenient to us

00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:35,409
and they have a problem with it so

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,080
they're a major university I think

00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:40,929
they're up to what 34 or 35,000 students

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,799
something like that a lot of classes a

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:46,929
lot of topics it does everybody here

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,090
know what a syllabus is it's like the

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,070
summary of the course it lists what

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,059
you're going to cover prerequisites

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:58,259
materials needed labs all that and the

00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:00,230
thing is they vary greatly between

00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:02,390
computer science courses

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,650
Engineering courses to humanities and

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:09,020
language and and textiles and art and

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:13,630
design and just different classes have

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:16,640
very very different approaches and the

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,830
the faculty have different ways that

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,130
they want to create their their syllabi

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:26,980
but there are also accreditation body

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:30,049
requirements you must have these minimum

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,549
standards you must meet for information

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,080
provided in the syllabus and that's

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:34,309
changed and evolved over the years and

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,720
there are some professors they created

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:40,490
their syllabus ten years ago and haven't

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:44,510
changed it so the university wanted to

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,309
achieve business goals that we found

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,880
were in conflict with long-established

00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:52,450
user behaviors how many of us here know

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,940
the phrase somebody moved my cheese

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,650
right back to the lots for those who

00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,510
haven't heard it is that referring to

00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,070
the the cheese at the end of the maze

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,910
it's the incentive for the mice to get

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,100
through the maze it's back to the point

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,600
about us being pattern-seeking animals

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,559
we learn a pattern we're comfortable

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,210
with that pattern we can work

00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,200
efficiently because we know that pattern

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,900
and we don't have to think about it

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,500
until somebody forces us to change that

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,470
pattern okay and that's what is going to

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,760
have to happen here so the stakeholders

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,850
in terms of doing the stakeholder

00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,860
interviews they needed to reflect

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,860
up-to-date requirements back to the

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,160
accreditation body requirements they

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,510
needed a flexible system that could

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,940
respond to changes with very little

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,730
backend updates and they wanted the

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,160
display to be more modern and responsive

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,780
you know those kinds of design terms we

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,299
here now web designers know what

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,590
responsive is non web designers have a

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:54,380
different meaning for responsive okay

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:57,049
and then but also you needed to allow

00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:00,980
for rollover of syllabi from previous

00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:03,470
semesters to allow people to get started

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,660
stop pick it back up in an intelligent

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,429
way to be flexible for the needs of all

00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,559
the different departments to provide

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,480
clear directions and feedback on how to

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,880
create them and to be able to integrate

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,670
with their course inventory management

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,770
and oh by the way the stakeholders made

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,510
it very very clear that said they said

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:24,590
you know you think students are bad at

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:28,100
procrastinating tell a professor to have

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:31,130
a new syllabus ready for you know date X

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:35,630
and they will be doing it at X minus one

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,790
they'll be preparing it now this this

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,230
was kind of a little red flag and a kind

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,660
of a self-awareness one of the

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,370
stakeholders said well people have may

00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,560
have said they want a modern and

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,910
responsive system but do you really

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,010
think they meant easy-to-use ok now this

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,260
this the he was very self aware I like

00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,630
this guy quite a lot I like all of them

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,220
they're great team they're Delta I

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,110
forget what the acronym stands for

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,410
something like distance education

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,120
learning technology something or other

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,260
they provide a lot of these kinds of

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,940
tools for the university and he kind of

00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,610
nailed it do you think it they meant

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,360
easy to use and it means easy for them

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:19,010
right so the research questions I mean

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,930
we wanted to test the interface and the

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,600
workflow the kind of normal things but

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,790
we also wanted to validate the value

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,330
proposition would it make life easier

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,650
for them so we did the usual kinds of

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,070
things we do stakeholder interviews

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:37,490
focus groups the thing that we different

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,130
did differently was a paper prototype so

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,950
I talked earlier about doing building

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,450
clickable mock-ups right and people

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,280
you've heard of wireframes and stuff

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,930
like that well and even quicker and

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:54,080
easier method is to take pieces of paper

00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,610
and draw out the interface and say and

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,870
have post-it notes ready okay you

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,790
clicked on this button now you've got a

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,090
pop-up smack down and post-it note you

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,490
know stuff like that it is a very quick

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,920
and what the reason I keep saying that

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,690
is because testing is expensive I was

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,400
like I want a thing I want to build the

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,040
thing and that costs enough money why

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,440
should I spend extra money testing the

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,900
ideas I know what people need so it's

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,910
very hard to get money for testing in

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,290
advance so that's why we come up with

00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,850
these techniques that try and be as

00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:27,620
cheap and easy as possible so that

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,330
you're not spending money writing

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,340
then testing it and going back and

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,920
reworking it so paper prototyping is not

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,230
so well known outside of UX and design

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,880
circles but it's a great technique we

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,470
learned a lot doing paper prototyping

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,960
with these faculty and staff and so what

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:48,050
we found was if faculty are smart people

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,240
they were able to figure out and use the

00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,900
proposed interface okay

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,780
but they strongly prefer to use their

00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,760
own tool sets mostly Google Docs okay so

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:02,030
it comes back to yeah they can do it but

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,890
will they do they want to so now this is

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,710
a key thing here the UX researcher this

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:09,700
was a member of my team said I was

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,809
terrified to present the results okay

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,440
how many of you been scared to give your

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:17,630
boss bad news okay well she wasn't I

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,250
mean I was her boss I didn't mind her

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,360
giving me bad news but she knew she was

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,809
going to have to present it to the

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,010
client this are the ones who had paid us

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:27,280
to do this work

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,970
fortunately like I said these people

00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:34,850
really appreciate the value of testing

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,620
and they got that because the

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,630
stakeholder said if the faculty don't

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,880
adopt the system the project will fail

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,910
that was kind of obvious this will be

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,280
directly related to both usability yes

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:49,480
you know needs to be usable and how we

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,650
internally present the system so that's

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,540
kind of a simplistic way of saying

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,400
organizational change management which

00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:59,120
is another whole topic whole course

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,970
whole book on that but this was a tested

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,570
the value proposition more so than the

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:10,670
interface so what are we going to do

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:13,760
then if you know there's going to be

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,950
resistance so what we did was and again

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,140
this isn't necessarily so crucial we we

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,940
developed a service blueprint which is

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,300
just a fancy phrase for kind of mapping

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,580
out the use process and you kind of

00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,470
swimlane it in terms of what the user

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,870
actions are what the users need to

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,090
perform the front stage meaning their

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:35,540
interface what they're working with back

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:38,720
stage meaning backs back in systems that

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,220
that feed that that information and then

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,960
support that's needed

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,630
various other team members that's not

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,679
automated through systems so we kind of

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:51,380
went through that process so as a result

00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:56,240
we did a few things we simplified the

00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,909
interface because we were forcing them

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,740
to change workflow so we decided we

00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:04,220
needed to change it as little as

00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:07,130
possible so simplifying it importantly

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,039
we changed it from a BIGBANG release to

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:13,760
like okay here's your new tool boom go

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:16,340
to a phased release and setup an alpha

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,990
test phase in an alpha test group to do

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:24,110
that so you're gonna get like graduate

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,580
students to do create the syllabi but

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,909
that's okay because what we're doing

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,520
there is testing the interface okay and

00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:33,559
it's removing an irritant for the

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,510
faculty it's like oh I'm gonna do all

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,940
this work you know - I've already got my

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,440
syllabus created why should i rekey it

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,289
in okay a student's gonna do that and

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,350
the faculty rule will review it to see

00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:48,500
if it meets their needs and allows them

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:54,159
to meet the new University requirements

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:57,650
right so the alpha phase was successful

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,900
we are still in the beta software

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,490
development right now so this is in

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,150
progress next year maybe I can give you

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:08,750
a report on how it worked out but it

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:11,390
user research led to a leaner lower risk

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,460
approach instead of spending all the

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,559
money and building a product and then

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,720
finding out people don't use it we did

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,700
you know quick cutting out pieces of

00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,000
paper and putting it in front of people

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:26,299
to see how they responded to the ideas

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,159
beforehand and then modified it so you

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:32,720
know what we can't look at alternate

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,539
future timelines right this isn't a

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,460
science fiction universe but we could

00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:43,700
have averted a disaster there so what I

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:49,580
want to say is that user experience and

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:51,980
design serves to master's okay we tend

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,539
to focus on the users that's what the

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,700
phrase says you

00:28:53,539 --> 00:29:01,580
X means user experience right but what

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:05,779
we have to remember is that something is

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:07,340
somebody is providing that experience to

00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:09,229
them okay

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:15,289
and we can't forget that half of the

00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:18,080
equation this is a tool I use in

00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:20,989
workshops a lot where these two

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,460
represent each half of that equation so

00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:24,499
the right hand side is the customer

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,820
profile we look at first of all what are

00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,009
the jobs they're trying to achieve

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,710
accomplish what are their objectives

00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,539
what tasks do they need to perform what

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,940
what pain points do they have associated

00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:37,369
with doing that currently what gains

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,849
could we provide that they weren't even

00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:42,590
expecting by the way that's a pro tip

00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:44,929
most people think that gains are just

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,460
removing the pain points no gains are

00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:49,609
giving them something extra that they

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,200
weren't expecting okay and then we turn

00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:53,389
that into a list of products and

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,159
services or in software terms it's you

00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:58,789
know features and functionality things

00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:02,299
like that specifically addressing pain

00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:04,789
relievers and game creators just a very

00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:06,320
simple example okay you know it takes a

00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:08,419
long time to create a syllabus I

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,940
typically can't do it in one session and

00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:13,099
when I crash out of the current system

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,690
or one that crash out but when I stop

00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:16,729
working in the current system I lose a

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,769
lot of information because it's not

00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:22,309
saved so we set up a system to better

00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:24,499
save that when I go to create a new

00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:26,359
course I have to completely be start

00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:28,909
over again well let's make it easier to

00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:31,159
kind of like import the previous

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:36,679
semester and then modify as needed and

00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:39,019
things like that but well I'm sorry I

00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,220
went off on a little tangent so we were

00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:43,669
talking about everything's in relation

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,249
to a provider the value proposition is

00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:47,389
crucial for a new product for those of

00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:49,159
us who have been working on the same

00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:52,429
product for a long time it can kind of

00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,109
be difficult to remember that so look at

00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:57,739
let's look at who's providing that value

00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:58,879
and you know for me it's important to

00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,249
remember they're typically the one

00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:05,299
paying our invoices or your paycheck or

00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:07,010
whatever your arrangement might be so

00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:09,560
they are very often it

00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,720
is rare that that for many of us it's

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,360
rare that we're working for the directly

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,740
for and with feedback from the end-user

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,830
a lot of times it's through an

00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:23,360
intermediary through our company through

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:27,380
a marketing group things like that so

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,620
this is a tool I use anybody Indian here

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:33,110
a business analyst know okay I know

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,570
there are a couple in the in the seminar

00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,490
I've talked to a couple so this is just

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,170
kind of a way to it's called the

00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:42,110
business model canvas there's also a

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:44,570
variant called the lean canvas and it's

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,850
a way of kind of touching on all the key

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,560
aspects of a business model and you can

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,090
summarize it in one page and my clients

00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,680
love it when we go through a workshop

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,170
and do this for them because it's all in

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:58,490
their head but it's not really laid out

00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:00,050
nicely and often we identify gaps in the

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,360
model for entrepreneurs because

00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:05,180
typically they get really they love this

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,410
I've got this idea for a solution but

00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,900
you haven't thought enough about the

00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,220
nuts and bolts like okay what are you

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,170
doing differently what's your unfair

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,210
advantage or what are your channels to

00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:17,000
the customer is going to be and things

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,980
like that so very important for this

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,320
discussion is it tends to be the top

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,810
half of that chart is the user focused

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,510
part and the lower half is the provider

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:31,010
focus in terms of defining our testing

00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,540
and in terms of testing the value

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,120
proposition we have to remember if the

00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,900
business model fails the user gets

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,330
nothing

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:42,590
and most of us can think of a few

00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:44,120
notable examples you know that slide

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,780
will have to change every six months or

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,710
something you know what the latest story

00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,770
that one's already getting a little bit

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,510
old I guess so if we're talking about

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,020
the business model and the value

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:59,570
proposition well you know who sets those

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,520
and what does that mean for them now if

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,020
you're a a software developer and you're

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,310
scratching an itch and you want to see

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,710
if it's got traction well that's great

00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,090
you're setting the model and if it's

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,920
open source it's a very simple business

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:13,310
system the business model is more like a

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,410
distribution model but for those who

00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,770
work in a business setting it's more

00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,509
complex than that so then you have a

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,279
management structure and a

00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:26,299
larger organization and things get

00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:29,269
complicated and so this is the there's a

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:31,279
results of a survey so since I lead the

00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,469
you know experience in research group I

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,299
read a lot of studies and things like

00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,619
that I'd have to look at the speaker

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:40,279
notes I don't remember which one I got

00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:41,599
this from this was a survey of different

00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,969
groups I don't know if you can see it

00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,609
green is marketing yellows product

00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:48,440
management blues design and UX light

00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:51,940
blue is market research and user

00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,549
research and red is the executive level

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,779
and the question is the statement is we

00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,669
have a deep understanding of our

00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:01,159
customers journeys across all touch

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,139
points online and offline and it it

00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,849
ranges from strongly disagree to

00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:06,919
strongly agree you're all familiar with

00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:09,200
that scale I'm sure so look at the

00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,750
distribution for everybody except red it

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,129
kind of peeks and the we got a slightly

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,539
agree not in the extremes you know

00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:20,119
except for the executives like oh yeah

00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:23,809
we got this I'm very sure that we

00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:26,480
understand our customers journey really

00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:29,019
okay let's ask the question in a

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,019
different way

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,829
our overall customer experience needs in

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,569
groove improvement now everybody's kind

00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:38,029
of jammed up against this strongly agree

00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:40,099
oh yeah we could improve this except for

00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:41,450
the executives I mean they still pretty

00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:44,299
much agree with that but it does tail

00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,950
off more in terms of well I don't think

00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:50,450
we need to improve it as much as

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:53,529
everybody else thinks so you know this

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:56,000
this really reinforces that notion of

00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:58,369
bad news doesn't roll uphill

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,160
you know nobody likes to give the boss

00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:03,680
bad news everybody like positive results

00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,829
remember the unicorns and rainbows

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:12,980
bad news gets filtered out but that can

00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:15,859
save a project so my my calls to action

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,559
from the talk would be to plan for

00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:19,970
testing and iteration okay remember we

00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,500
talked before about that's that's one of

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,750
the reasons that nobody liked me was I

00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,910
had completely blown the production

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,849
schedule I had blown the budget because

00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:33,470
it was not planned for and scheduled for

00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:34,369
and budgeted for okay so and actually

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,200
that was manufacture

00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:39,950
but still in software developments the

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,920
same thing plan for time for testing and

00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:45,190
for remediation and what you find and

00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,539
testing it's it's it seems to me

00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:50,239
ridiculous but it happens very often

00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:52,519
where you'll see a development team a

00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,219
project that they planned for testing

00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:57,130
but they didn't plan any time for fixing

00:35:55,219 --> 00:36:00,920
things that testing found

00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:02,450
then why tests you know I mean well okay

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm not gonna go that far but you know

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,599
what I mean

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,700
if you don't plan for failure failure

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,920
will happen unplanned which is what most

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:15,559
of us experience smile and don't groan

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,630
at test fails okay you just learned

00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,789
something valuable and that can be

00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,489
really hard if you are the developer

00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:24,349
you're the designer you were on so my

00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:27,019
team you know user experience and and

00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:28,729
and research and design and information

00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,239
architecture this happens to us all the

00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:33,499
time

00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:38,479
I guess maybe we're used to it because

00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:41,779
we know you know we we we joke about

00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:45,829
making stuff up but in an informed

00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:47,089
fashion you know because and this is

00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,009
true for many of us I know we're not

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:51,589
that special where you can get all kinds

00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:54,380
of inputs and data and all that but at

00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:55,999
some point it means a professional has

00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,460
to go into a room and shut the door and

00:36:55,999 --> 00:37:01,249
take all those inputs and use a mix of

00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,130
art and science to come up with what

00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:06,259
they think will work best okay we just

00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:09,650
have to do that more than than other

00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:11,499
people a lot of times so we get feedback

00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,969
that we were wrong on a regular basis

00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:16,430
okay the people who aren't used to that

00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:18,920
can have a really hard time accepting

00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,650
that news that no no this thing that you

00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,599
think is brilliant it's not working for

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,660
people and actually that's one of the

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,700
great things about doing testing is

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,549
because instead of it changes it from a

00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,819
me versus you conversation about I think

00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:36,589
you you know design this poorly or

00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,479
whatever it's like hey it's not me look

00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,759
at these people struggling with it in

00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:44,029
the videos and things like that videos

00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:46,309
are fantastic there's nothing better to

00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:47,930
show a client or a product manager or

00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,310
something like that is a video

00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:53,260
of somebody struggling with their

00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:56,780
brilliant concept videos fantastic

00:37:53,260 --> 00:38:00,290
so take negative feedback to heart if

00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,660
it's hard to hear you really need to

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,400
listen if you find yourself kind of

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,830
starting to object that's we need to

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,080
like take a breath and listen to what

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:16,370
they're telling you think about your

00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:19,700
value to clients as much as to users so

00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:21,740
this may be a little bit more important

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,560
for me since I work in an agency model I

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,300
don't work for a product company product

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,920
development or company like many of you

00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,990
do so because yes we want a fantastic

00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,030
experience for the users but they're not

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:39,620
the ones with money in the game it's the

00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:44,030
company that's paying to develop it so

00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:46,460
think about the value to them as well so

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,190
now I want to go back and see do you

00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,140
remember when I said I found a problem

00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,840
in the Bradley Fighting Vehicle you want

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,700
to see how that turned out

00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:05,200
so this is let's see if this will work

00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:05,200
so this this is a video let me pause it

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:11,210
so there's a video of a demonstration

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,370
it's you know you see a little

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,630
grandstand there with some army folks

00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:16,580
and stuff like that this is a

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,650
demonstration of their Bradley's and

00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,990
what they're doing you'll hear a little

00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,310
pop up opposite if we've got nothing but

00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:25,640
my speakers here you won't hear anything

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:27,320
at all they're firing as they're moving

00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,910
and a little bit into it you'll see what

00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,280
they're firing at and this demonstrates

00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:34,760
their ability to fire while moving which

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,070
was their key value proposition right

00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,080
their defense is to be able to keep

00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,730
moving at speed and their offense is to

00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,130
be able to keep firing now watch the

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:46,690
turn state turret is stable on target

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:50,930
while the body is spinning underneath it

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:53,330
it's a little gun so it doesn't expire

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,640
an explosive round it fires a depleted

00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,980
uranium slug which are really really

00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,750
heavy at high velocity so the kinetic

00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,760
energy just tore turns it into a molten

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:08,210
mass when it hits the the enemy

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:14,510
cool okay now now it's just boring after

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:18,860
that the so don't wait a minute how I

00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:22,060
get to the next slide I have to escape

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,060
out of the video or something

00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:43,970
user fail okay let's reload now we'll

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:46,160
get back to my okay so the results the

00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,730
combat results so the Bradley Fighting

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:55,190
Vehicle crews were so happy they came to

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:58,520
our plant to tell us their stories so

00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:04,700
what happens was this was then I forget

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:09,140
the first Gulf War they were faster than

00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:11,630
the m1a1 Abrams main battle tank so they

00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:14,530
were able to go faster than the tanks

00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:17,810
and they encountered the enemy tanks and

00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,160
and they were older Soviet t-34s that

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,200
the Iranians had so basically they were

00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,940
literally able to run circles around

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,580
them and town rounds into them and

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,050
destroy them and the tank guys were

00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,630
really upset because when they got there

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:34,190
there was nothing for them to do you

00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:37,790
know so that's what we all want is for

00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,320
the thing that we are working on for the

00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,260
users to come back and say you know what

00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,780
it for performed beautifully and it

00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:48,680
allowed me to do more than I expected to

00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:51,800
be able to do okay so the way to do that

00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:56,960
is to - I mean yes it takes good design

00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,070
but to test beforehand so that's all I

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,020
have

00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,340
I'm happy to answer questions if

00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,870
anybody's got any questions about that I

00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,030
appreciate you coming I realized this is

00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,070
a very technology heavy conference I

00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:09,170
didn't expect a large audience I'm

00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:15,280
pleased with the turnout so thank you

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:15,280
I love making software better yes

00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,910
so oh gosh this is okay now you can

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:29,359
making me feel old this is like over 20

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:31,700
years ago so the way to get precise and

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,590
rapid control is through digital devices

00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:38,420
as opposed to analog devices everybody

00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:41,210
here gets that right but drives for big

00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,130
heavy steel turrets or actually those

00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:47,300
were machined aluminum if I remember

00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,330
correctly are basically analog devices

00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:55,250
okay so the way to make that transition

00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:59,869
was we had a power converter very high

00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,250
current power converter that was as with

00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:03,980
a lot of military things was like

00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,410
operating on the edge of what was

00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,530
possible and when you're pushing the

00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,540
edge you have to to be very careful in

00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,030
your testing so what was funny was that

00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,070
was you know people think about quality

00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,520
control and they hear about auto

00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:21,200
manufacturing where you're making

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,880
thousands hundreds of thousands millions

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,710
of vehicles I mean that's why I Drive an

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,150
f-150 pickup is because there's a

00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,440
million on the road it's easy to get

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,089
parts and get it worked on stuff like

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,320
that or watching YouTube video to fix

00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:34,820
something yourself like God recently did

00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:39,619
for those the production run was

00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,270
hundreds so testing is a little you

00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:44,630
can't quite get those statistics of

00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:48,830
large numbers for the satellite that was

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:51,950
really funny so I did work with one of

00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,390
our satellite divisions you're making

00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,940
something that flies into space you're

00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,220
making two you know one that you can

00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,530
test destructively and one that's going

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,880
to fly maybe a little bit of an

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:05,450
exaggeration maybe you make three or

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,250
four and you do destructive testing

00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,080
there it's like okay well this one broke

00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:14,210
at that voltage you know so we're gonna

00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:16,700
take it down a little bit so it was the

00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:20,480
problem that I found was in that power

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:24,020
converter and the control system

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,609
associated with it that helps is kind of

00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,690
a vague answer it was a long time ago I

00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,650
don't

00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:58,310
did somebody else have a question over

00:44:28,650 --> 00:45:01,800
here yes yeah those those pressures

00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:09,230
shall not you know don't take that

00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:09,230
lightly so I'm a great example of hmm

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,590
right so I'm going to give an example a

00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,390
personal example here so what's the

00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,800
phrase the Peter Principle you rise to

00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,920
the level of your own competence or

00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,560
something like maybe that doesn't sound

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,960
good on me but so I in my career path I

00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:32,280
mean I'm a grey hair I rose to a certain

00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,990
level where I was not enjoying life okay

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,780
and then I took a career break and came

00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:41,609
back to doing something that was fun and

00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:44,430
in that position I was told one time you

00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:46,440
know well I look forward to your

00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,600
analysis that's gonna confirm this and I

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,540
said well what if my analysis doesn't

00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:54,330
confirm that he said and this executive

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,900
looking me I am confident your analysis

00:45:54,330 --> 00:46:00,720
will show this correct so I left that

00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,430
company and I'm this is one that I have

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,200
not named you know and it wasn't on my

00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:09,570
slide deck the CFO I was working for was

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:15,450
indicted on fraud a year after I left so

00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:18,740
I am proud that I did not see myself as

00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:21,890
a fit for that corporate culture

00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,890
somebody else

00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:34,440
I don't know well I was yeah all my

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:36,840
background varied so I went to North

00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,240
Carolina State University got a degree

00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,160
in physics yeah well that wasn't a thing

00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,180
when I was there I came back to Raleigh

00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,530
and his people were doing that's like

00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:48,720
what is this you got a little twitch

00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:51,120
here and so I graduated in 81 I got I'd

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,920
like to say that I got kicked this is

00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,530
very relevant to the talk and we've got

00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,450
time so I can tell stories you get bored

00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,660
you can leave I got kicked out of

00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,680
Electrical Engineering so I thought well

00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,120
what am I gonna do Electrical

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,940
Engineering looked like fun and I had a

00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,890
really good advisor he pulled me out in

00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:11,700
and in his office one day after class

00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:16,410
and he said you know you're being a

00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,730
disruption in class so I'm paying

00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,840
attention I'm asking questions he said

00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:25,410
that's just it you keep asking why

00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,860
questions engineers are all about how to

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:30,090
do things like they'd say okay and one

00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,030
of these other talks somebody mentioned

00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,110
a Fourier series analysis and I would

00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,820
say why do you use a Fourier series

00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,480
analysis to solve this problem because

00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,480
it works

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,220
yeah but why does it work it's like okay

00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,440
the rest of these guys finish building

00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,600
this thing and you're asking why so he

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,750
recommended I go into physics now as he

00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,870
was right I was much happier in physics

00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:54,480
in an engineering thermo course

00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:57,300
thermodynamics you would start off with

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,880
the ideal gas law and do calculations in

00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,800
my class we started with more

00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,900
fundamental principles and my final exam

00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,560
was one question see if I can get this

00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:10,350
right now you you've been living in

00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,760
universe where the spin of fermions or

00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,310
bosons I forget which is plus or minus

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,440
1/2 now our universe where it's plus or

00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:20,190
minus 1/3 what is the ideal gas law in

00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,080
this universe and after after sweating

00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:25,650
massively for a while I settled down and

00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,750
got it right but you know that is why I

00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:31,590
do this kind of work now it's because

00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,200
I'm gonna ask why kind of guy but oh

00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,280
sayings finished answering your question

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,560
you can cut me off whenever what's my

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,880
background so I did that and that was

00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,070
fun

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,990
it's like woohoo fun physics how do you

00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,430
get a job with physics and I was out of

00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:46,370
money so I only got a bachelor's degree

00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:49,100
and with an undergrad degree in physics

00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:53,360
so I went to the nuclear Navy which was

00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:55,790
great it was taking all this theoretical

00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,770
knowledge I had and turning it into real

00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:01,310
knowledge of how to operate a reactor

00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:03,470
safely at sea with a tube full of you

00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:05,750
know nuclear warheads and pressurized

00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:07,460
hydraulics and stuff like that

00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,720
that was great fun then where do you go

00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,130
from the military you go to work for a

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,290
defense contractor and play with all

00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:14,480
those bang technology I was in supplier

00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:15,680
Quality Assurance I started off in their

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,050
engineering went supplier Quality

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,640
Assurance which meant I got to go to all

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,710
our suppliers and see all the whiz-bang

00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,240
technology they were making for us that

00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:28,910
was that was way cool

00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:35,290
that was good life I was well know in

00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:38,810
the 80s so I got out in 87 yeah I was in

00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:43,150
comm sub Ron 18 and the in Goose Creek

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:46,130
and the Naval Shipyard in Charleston

00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:48,950
okay so so I worked in the naval

00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:51,110
shipyard at Charleston and then

00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,540
submarine squadron 18 in the floating

00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:56,390
the AR DM floating dry dock up there and

00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,720
went to sea to qualify as you know stuff

00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:07,870
like that

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:11,090
it's fun I was USS Nathan Hale which

00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:12,230
which reminds me of our bumper sticker

00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:18,710
which I can't tell and it makes the

00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:21,860
crowd so I won't do it okay I yes

00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,860
[Music]

00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:35,600
well I would say neither one because the

00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:38,300
videos will be of people taking a test a

00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,580
usability test so it's not me telling a

00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,890
story so it's not me presenting data or

00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:47,990
me telling an anecdote it's watching

00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:49,850
users try to use their product their

00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,290
software something like that so thank

00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,960
you for the clarification does that does

00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:56,930
that help yeah so so again it remit

00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:00,320
removes that argument about I am Telling

00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:03,590
You that your product failed it's like

00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:06,530
the users can't figure it out you know

00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:19,490
so it really helps shoot down a lot of

00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:27,200
arguments so what let me go back up here

00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:30,740
so if you look at this one at the test

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:33,710
method that the test design there was a

00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,970
first impression task it's like what are

00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,760
your feelings about this then we had

00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:40,460
some tasks for them to perform we

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,440
watched them perform the tasks we asked

00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,590
them a question about it afterwards and

00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:49,430
then we had a survey after all of the

00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:55,190
tasks so it was a combination of what

00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:57,290
they did what we observed which is kind

00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,760
of anecdotal in terms of well they

00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:01,580
didn't say this but I noticed they

00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,800
paused or hesitated here and and we

00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,270
measure things like time on task you

00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,830
know how long if it took longer to

00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:09,050
perform this one than that one then

00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:11,920
maybe the first one wasn't as clear

00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:14,120
things like that so there's a lot of

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,750
things that we're looking at in a

00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:21,560
well-designed test and so like that the

00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:23,660
top right corner there it really depends

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:27,650
on the test that we're performing how

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:30,350
you can record it but yeah audio and

00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,870
video recordings are great so what we

00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:35,180
will do is we of course do a summary

00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:37,820
report and you just saw some excerpts of

00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,000
those they tend to be very long and

00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,750
boring unless you're

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,620
intensely interested in that product and

00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:49,410
then to have video evidence to back up

00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:50,820
what you're saying you know so when you

00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,530
say people were really confused about

00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,150
this they can say yeah yeah you just

00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,310
don't like that you know but then you

00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:59,640
show a video of somebody just completely

00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:00,990
stuck and lost it makes the point does

00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:19,070
that answer your question okay

00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:19,070
yes any UX what about no I have not yeah

00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:37,760
you know come to think of it I have not

00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:37,760
either that's right

00:53:50,820 --> 00:54:01,950
right right

00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:12,370
and yeah and many of us can think of a

00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,650
commands where the the name of the

00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:16,450
command is is quirky you know just it

00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,820
tickled the fancy of the person who

00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:21,580
created it as opposed to a lot of what

00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:24,430
we do is label testing is well somebody

00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:26,830
understand what this does based on what

00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:30,100
you're calling it you know so that would

00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:31,750
be one thing we could do there you know

00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,090
a lot of times we look for places that

00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:36,340
need contextual help that might be

00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,990
harder to do in the limited interface

00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,730
there but in terms of structuring the

00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:41,380
demand pages things like that could be

00:54:39,730 --> 00:55:08,590
useful because we all love to do

00:54:41,380 --> 00:55:09,820
documentation yep that that's an

00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,830
excellent point

00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,480
stick to the standards standards are

00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,360
standards for a reason that's the

00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,530
default behavior that people who that so

00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,810
that's what they'll go to and it's just

00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,970
even more frustrating if they go to you

00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:24,190
know - eh and and don't get an answer

00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,360
not only did they not get their answer

00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,900
but now they're just ticked off because

00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:32,310
yet another thing didn't work for them

00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,310
so yeah start with standards yes

00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,000
yeah that's a good question I do not

00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:05,920
know if such a thing exists I have not

00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,450
seen it I've not been asked to do any

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,850
kind of testing like that but that's a

00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,960
very interesting question so we got

00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:19,470
three minutes left or any other

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:22,240
interesting questions yes yes yes

00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:24,640
so no no that's that's very important

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,070
because as the slide said I had a

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,460
staffer who was terrified to present the

00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:32,620
results so you never just say yeah this

00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:35,170
this part of your design or this part of

00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:37,000
your thing is terrible you don't you

00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:39,550
don't lead with that you lead with this

00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,590
is what we were testing ideally you

00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:43,510
would have a design hypothesis to begin

00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,580
with you know the hypothesis is of the

00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:49,120
form of we believe that if we provide

00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,160
this to that user who's trying to do

00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:55,540
this thing we will observe these results

00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:57,640
right and so we start with when I talk

00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,350
about these long detailed reports we

00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,930
start off with what were we trying to

00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:06,520
test what was the methodology that we

00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:09,730
used what did we see and then an

00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:13,330
analysis of what we you know okay we

00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:15,400
took all this that we saw and applied

00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,500
thought process to it this is what we

00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,300
find is the results and then we make

00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,860
these recommendations based upon it

00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,530
that's the other thing is you never tell

00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,150
anybody well this is bad you explain why

00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:27,160
it's bad and what could be done to

00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,620
improve it does that help answer the

00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,870
question yeah yeah we never lead with

00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:33,910
the bad news we lead with what were we

00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:35,890
trying to find out how do we try to find

00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,660
it out what do we observe what does our

00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:40,300
analysis show about that and now the bad

00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:43,600
news is we need to change this thing and

00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,170
here's how it's change it anything else

00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,170
yes

00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,210
the overall project including code we're

00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:13,799
in beta development of the code right

00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:16,049
now yes well that's a good point yes we

00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:18,599
yeah instead of being an alpha release

00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:23,539
of the code you're right for us that was

00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:26,099
like an alpha of the concept you know

00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:28,529
we're releasing this concept of people

00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:30,829
in this version seeing how they respond

00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:35,839
to it as opposed to releasing a a

00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:39,529
defined codes release that makes sense

00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:39,529
good question yes

00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:59,290
well so we were a bunch of engineers we

00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,560
didn't we don't know military tactics

00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,560
