Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
We will talk about spectacular failures, great successes and how to avoid the former and ensure the latter. We start with a multi-million dollar crash and end with a tank crew happily blowing things up. In between we talk about user testing principles and techniques my team has applied to open source application development. Whether you are developing a simple script to scratch an itch or are part of a large team working on a huge project, you can benefit from learning how to test the value of your idea as early as possible, saving time and money that can be invested in development of a concept you have validated with early testing.
