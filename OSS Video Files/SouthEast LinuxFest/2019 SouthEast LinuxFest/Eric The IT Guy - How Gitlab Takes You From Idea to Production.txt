Title: Eric The IT Guy - How Gitlab Takes You From Idea to Production
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	2019 SouthEast LinuxFest; Now more than ever, developers have more tools to pick from than hours in the day. It is so easy to spend more time maintaining the development pipeline than it is actually developing. What if the planning, coding, building, testing, and deployment could all be handled from one tool in one interface? Well it can! Gitlab can cut down on tool chain bloat and decrease cycle times!

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
number of conferences lately meeting

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,710
people making connections and just

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,290
generally trying to raise awareness for

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,910
open source so that's that's kind of its

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,610
kind of a little bit about who I am I

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,839
said this is not a sales pitch I'm not

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,359
going to be asking you to pull out your

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
wallets you can download get laps EE

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,550
it's our Community Edition it's open

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,099
core it's free but I will throw in a

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,980
quick plug and say that open source

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,369
projects and personal projects that our

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,380
public repositories get the get a free

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,809
ultimate license so if you're a school

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,899
if you're a or if you're an open source

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,730
project and you host on get lab comm or

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,530
if you run a self-hosted instance of get

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,450
lab you actually get the top tier

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,370
application for free because again lab

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,149
does believe in education get lab does

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,360
believe in open source so with that i'm

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,250
i'm taking my proverbial salesman hat

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,570
off and i just want to talk to you guys

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,750
i just want to connect to you guys on a

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,340
technical level you know get labs a

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,589
great tool and i want a kind of want to

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,420
talk about about why that is and and how

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,189
that can change if how that can change

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,240
if you're a systems engineer if you're

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:16,520
if you're developer it's a really a

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,030
great tool that will that can help you

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,619
with your development process and so for

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,990
those of you that don't know get lab is

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,320
not related to github they're actually

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,000
competitors get lab is not an engine

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,470
that runs on top of github those are

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,950
those are two things I've heard in the

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,369
past month no we're not a github clone

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,930
we're our own thing and the only

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:42,030
actually the only thing github and get

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,250
lab have in common is the git protocol

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,579
so just want to clarify that real quick

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,930
so what is get lab get lab is a single

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,090
application for the entire software

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,950
development lifecycle so we do issue

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,020
management we do project management so

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,360
if your if your company is looking at a

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,240
DevOps philosophy for your development

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,329
processes if you're doing if you're if

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,860
you're agile or scrum or safe or one of

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,599
these other development methodologies

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,569
anything but monolith get lab has a

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,750
project management for that SCM source

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,310
control management that's

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,290
that's kind of what we're known for but

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,550
so what some of the features that get

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,080
lab has been working on the past few

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,600
years that a lot of people don't know we

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,580
have is we have a CI CD pipeline so we

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,460
have runners which are completely

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,050
open-source so just go online look up

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,400
get lab runners you'll find an open

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:35,080
source project that's based on Linux and

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,240
anything that you can anything that you

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,190
can do on the command line you can put

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,140
into these runners and they'll do your

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,060
build jobs the get lab runners are kind

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,300
of the workers for the for the get lab

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,500
app application what what we've been

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,989
working on the past year or so is

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,459
security scanning so we can do container

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,340
scanning we can do license management

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,380
scans SAST and DAST scanning so that's

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,300
the static application scanning so it'll

00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,200
check your code for known

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,520
vulnerabilities and then once your

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,470
application is up and running it'll do

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:10,630
some desk scanning which is dynamic

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:14,230
application st anybody else feeling the

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,670
the acronym overload lately between the

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,400
acronym overload and the marketing hype

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,470
I can't keep it up anyway danced is

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
dynamic application scanning and that's

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,010
that's basically once your application

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,709
is up it tries to see if there's

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:32,519
anything that can bring it down

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:34,450
I apologize Mike's a little hot and so

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,670
actually later on this year we're going

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,250
to be releasing new phase for the DevOps

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,799
life cycle and that's defend so that's

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,260
going to be I asked scanning and things

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,570
like it's interactive application

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,450
scanning so it'll try and do sequel

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,690
injections it'll try and send unusual

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,670
unusual queries into your application to

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,269
see if it see if they can find any of

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,670
owner abilities and why why all of these

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,989
why all these features why all these

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,579
phases of the development lifecycle a

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,410
lot of us are probably familiar with

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,290
github a lot of us have probably heard

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,579
about Jenkins I think he doing this to

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,590
people because I hate these questions

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,930
myself but show of hands who's who in

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,410
here is a developer you know who I'm

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,220
talking to

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:25,780
ok sis admins Wow split all right

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,770
network

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,770
all right everybody make fun of the

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,360
networking guy that's that's rule number

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,599
one in case you didn't know blame blame

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,919
the network engineer let's see just

00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:42,289
enthusiasts okay cool

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:45,110
well okay Devin manager awesome any

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:47,509
anyone ID anyone I left out no project

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:53,240
managers I hope okay because I have a

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:57,259
joke about that later okay so now that I

00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,029
can have an idea of who's in the room so

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:02,960
get lab is not just about developers

00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,580
application development is not just

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,870
about developers and that's that's kind

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,389
of where the DevOps piece of this talk

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,159
comes in what we're trying to do with

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,050
development is we're trying to increase

00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:14,599
speed how many of you especially on

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,939
those of us in infrastructure because I

00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,770
spend ten years as a systems engineer

00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:21,800
how many of us are having to do more

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,439
with less every single year less staff

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:31,159
less hardware I see one guy shaking his

00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:32,870
head and yeah yeah it's everywhere fair

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:36,680
enough yeah I mean developments being

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,689
asked to do the same thing so so I am

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,129
but I am a little biased i'ma since I'm

00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,529
a systems engineer I spent a lot of

00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,639
years wondering what the development

00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:43,939
team was doing on the other side of the

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,250
wall

00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,020
DevOps is about removing that wall in

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,399
fact that's that's great comment because

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,620
that kind of leads in my next point

00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:56,779
it's right now so many of us are systems

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,240
engineers and developers and security

00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,250
guys and project management and there's

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,439
these silos in between all of us how

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,419
many of us have spent hours trying to

00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,310
get an issue fixed because we needed

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,870
something from another team and you send

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,060
the ticket over and you wait and you

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,199
wait and you wait you can't just walk

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,189
over to their desk because they don't

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,469
they don't work in the same office

00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:17,169
anymore

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,399
how many of us have had problems with

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:22,250
trying to get that new feature released

00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,169
for for a development release and we

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,879
can't because the system engineers are

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,979
too busy playing Halo to actually build

00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,080
the servers when in reality the systems

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,509
engineers have about a hundred of those

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,669
requests how many of us have dealt with

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,980
those days where we're stuck in project

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,720
management meetings because we can't

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,400
and we're not getting work done we're

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,130
not we're not doing anything because

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,410
we're too busy working the the queue

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,570
we're too busy talking about the work we

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,090
have to do DevOps is about changing that

00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,310
it is not a silver bullet DevOps is not

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,930
a tool DevOps is a philosophy it's a way

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,300
of doing work it's a way of thinking

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,130
about work it's about taking a developer

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,380
and a systems engineer and a network

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,450
engineer and a security engineer and a

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,950
project manager and whoever else needs

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,750
to be involved putting them in the same

00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,370
room opening up those lines of

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,230
communication knocking down those walls

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,510
so that we can actually get work done

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,730
and get lab is a great tool to help

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:17,810
accomplish that so if you're if you're

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:19,040
stuck trying to if you're stuck not

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,600
being able to get work done if you

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,360
constantly feel like you're having to do

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,030
more with less and velocity needs to

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,500
increase but your backlog its is

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,170
increasing get lab is a tool that can

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,870
help fix that issue it can't fix your

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,240
company but it can it can enable a

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,440
culture shift and thence that's what

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,620
that's what we're trying to accomplish

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,530
we're trying to achieve more with less

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,580
over the past five years tools like salt

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,270
stack tools like ansible tools like like

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,740
like pipelines like jenkins and get lab

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,760
these tools have become more and more

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,580
and more powerful

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,960
so let me linden I apologize to the

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,760
developers but I'll talk to you guys

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,460
here in a minute but Tamiya system is an

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,590
engineer's think about it this way how

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,020
many times do you build the same exact

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,240
server over and over and over again how

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,340
many times you get a request to build to

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,050
build none of us use my sequel anymore

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,510
so it's how many of us are asked to use

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,190
Murray Adobe with the same developers

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,960
that have access to the box with the

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,880
same patches with the same utilities

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,980
with the same security scanning software

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,480
how many of us build those same servers

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,910
over and over again and it takes four

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,190
days to do it after waiting a week to

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,500
get the requisite hardware get the the

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,150
VM spun up from the VMware team how many

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,060
of us do the same work over and over and

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,650
over again I got tired of it it's like I

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,210
want to play with some of the new shiny

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,950
stuff but I'm stuck building the same

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,830
server and then what do you know six

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,250
weeks after you built the dev box for

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,570
for your DBAs then they're like hey yeah

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,030
we're done with dev we're ready for

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,820
stage and then six weeks later you have

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,670
to go back and remember

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,380
what you did 12 weeks ago to build on

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,310
the production server and so you have

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,230
this drift

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,140
you've got server drift you've got

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,490
feature drift I mean it's just a

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,250
complete waste of time so there there's

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:12,150
a greater need for all of us to be

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,930
engaged in continuous learning so when

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,310
you're looking at something like

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,320
continuous learning you have to have

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,420
that kind of time and most of us don't

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,740
have time to work eight hours if we're

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,090
lucky drive two hours there and back

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,300
spend time with our family god forbid

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,310
sleep and learn everything that's coming

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,470
at us all the new technologies all the

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,860
vulnerabilities all the changes in NIT

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,720
in the industry itself so we have to cut

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,360
stuff somewhere how about we cut some of

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,310
the redundant error-prone issues that we

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,250
see why not take take the manpower out

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,720
of IT we built these computer systems in

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,120
order to make our lives easier and

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,010
instead how many of us get those two

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,110
a.m. phone calls on a Saturday night

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,970
when a database server I hope there's no

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:02,790
TVs in the room I'm not intentionally

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,770
picking on the database folks I mean how

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,560
many of us get that 2:00 a.m. phone call

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,150
because some database server that only

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,470
two people in the entire company care

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,150
about and they don't come into work on

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,000
Monday morning but yet because we're

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,160
carrying the quote/unquote pager we're

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,560
the ones who get called we're the ones

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,360
who have to get up at 2:00 a.m. no

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,160
matter no matter if we'd been up all

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,600
night with a sick kid no matter if we'd

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,890
been out of town it doesn't matter we're

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,770
carrying the pager we're the ones who

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,170
have to get up and fix that and fix that

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,280
server and then very quickly wake up the

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,560
networking guy and tell him it's his

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,300
Network and blame him so this is leading

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,170
to burnout it's leading to poor

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,360
work-life balance it's leading to people

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,730
not loving their jobs I mean how many of

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,500
us got into got into IT as a profession

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,210
because we loved working on technology

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,160
we loved gadgets we love taking things

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,200
apart seeing how they work putting them

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,150
back together for us it servers other

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,220
people and maybe cooking but for us it's

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,740
it's technology it's open source and

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,220
then and and that even further is my

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,730
point because with open source your

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,050
you really can take an application apart

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,870
and put it back together see how it

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:15,050
works make changes throw at weird errors

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,030
just to see how it responds but we end

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,810
up spending all of our day reading

00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,010
tickets going to meetings building the

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,540
same servers over and over again

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,560
deploying the same code over and over

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,000
again so we need to change how we work

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,110
we need to change how we think about

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,110
work so using a DevOps type philosophy

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,930
shifting left so to speak we want to put

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,960
as much of the work ahead of ahead of

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,240
RFU as we can and to do that we've got

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,190
to work together as developers systems

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,960
engineers network engineers all around

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,510
the same table and we need to automate

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,380
everything we can so infrastructure is

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,050
code

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,440
networking is code I mean all these all

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:01,430
these all these acronyms that we get we

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,650
get thrown out every day so that was a

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,000
really really long tangent for a slide

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:09,790
that actually only had about two lines

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,720
of notes so let me get back into my talk

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,210
but this is something we need to address

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,670
as an industry we need to work on

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,080
automating what we can so that we can

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,330
spend more of our time innovating

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,160
because if we innovate we can get those

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,590
features released on time if we're

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,770
innovating and automating we can work on

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:29,630
whether Ubuntu or Alpine would be a

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,520
better container platform for our

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,110
infrastructure we can actually do those

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,240
things if we automate away the things

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,250
that are error-prone if systems updates

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,140
are part of an automated job and we get

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,210
an email report at the end of the at the

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,190
end of the night we're not sitting up at

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,870
2 a.m.

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,910
installing patches rebooting servers and

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,380
then verifying applications because we'd

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,150
have the monitoring in the automation in

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,210
place to where the only time you'd get

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,700
paged is if that automation failed and

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,560
if that's the case then you look at the

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,050
automation you see where it failed you

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,650
fix it and then you fix it once and it

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,440
works across the board I mean how many

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,050
of us started using a tool like T MUX or

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,450
screen because we had 20 servers with

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,880
the same kernel parameter that needed

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,180
one character changed that zero needed

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,080
to be one and that's all we had to do

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,850
but yet we had

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,310
to use a tool like T MUX because we had

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,200
20 servers or 200 servers where ever we

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,680
had to go and change that 0 to a 1 just

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,660
to get everything working so for today's

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,750
talk that's that's where gitlab comes in

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,480
and and fun fact this is not a fox this

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,180
is actually called a tanuki and a tanuki

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:44,210
is a Japanese raccoon dog roughly

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:46,040
translated that's the tanuki so the the

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,430
tanuki is known as a smart animal that

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,680
works in a group to achieve common goals

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,680
so get 11 kind of picked this the tanuki

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,440
as as its mascot one I think because

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,470
it's cute but also because they're very

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,360
social animals they work together to to

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,360
achieve whatever whatever their goal is

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:15,230
so how many of us love doing live demos

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,300
at conferences I mean what what could

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,540
possibly go wrong here because I'm on

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:25,280
hotel Wi-Fi using handheld mic trying to

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:27,290
connect out to the Internet to do this I

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,930
don't see how this could possibly

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:37,520
possibly blow out and blow up in my face

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:41,650
I didn't make any sacrifices this

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,650
morning so we may be in for a treat

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,670
that's not gonna work

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,180
ok give me just a second here and we're

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,180
off to a great start

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,160
okay so everybody might want to scoot

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:06,990
forward a little bit because that looks

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:09,350
like about all I want to get maybe what

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,350
I'll do

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:29,230
yeah yeah that's not any better okay

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:32,730
alright so for what it's worth this is

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:38,980
get lap calm and get lap calm is just a

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:41,680
get lap managed instance of get lab so

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,540
it runs on Google cloud platform so on

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:50,470
on GCP and it is free to sign up you can

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,240
you you can have I forget how many how

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:56,140
many repositories if you're a personal

00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:02,290
user in and you won't you won't get

00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:04,420
asked to pay so let's see let's let's

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,330
jump into the demo here again I

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,720
apologize for the and so the all the

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,490
slides with screenshots of my of the

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,160
demo itself will be available online

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,740
after the talk I'll make sure that that

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,340
URL gets attached to the video and just

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,040
I do apologize for the the screen

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:30,760
quality make sure we'll have to spring

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:32,620
for for like 8k or something okay so so

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,210
let me let me paint the picture here we

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,010
kind of talked about DevOps we kind of

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:40,990
talked about get lot so let's let's put

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:43,620
this in practical terms so we all get

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,450
invited to a meeting boss is ticked

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,880
we've got a website the front page is

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,010
terrible it you can't read it it's not

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,750
engaging we need to change this and we

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,860
need to change it yesterday how many of

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,540
us have been drug into those kind of

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,510
meetings and you just go and the systems

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,000
engineer the server up again that's

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,830
that's all I got for you

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,589
so that's happened to me more times than

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:10,780
I care to admit but so we have this

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,910
meeting and we come away with with some

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,800
action items we need to make some

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,420
changes to the application we need to we

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,680
need to give the the front page a

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:25,990
facelift so what we're going to do is

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:27,160
we're just going to we're going to we're

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,030
just going to kind of start from scratch

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,780
we're going to start a new project we're

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,780
going to walk through this

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,370
so with gitlab I know it's really hard

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,990
to see but you can start either a blank

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,240
project you can create from a number

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:51,670
templates that that are built into the

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:56,830
application you can import a project we

00:17:51,670 --> 00:18:00,070
support bitbucket Google Code github or

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:04,630
just a straight just a straight

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:07,510
repository that's what we're going to do

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,850
today excuse me while I grab the URL

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,000
it wasn't my clipboard until I restarted

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,000
my computer

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,960
so anybody noticed the more people

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,330
watching you while you type the harder

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,980
it gets okay so so and get lab comm

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,160
there's a project called Auto DevOps

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,070
examples and I'll talk a little bit here

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,800
in a minute about what Auto DevOps is

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,290
but in lab gives you a lot of ways to

00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,310
get get started with with basic hello

00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:02,530
world type applications so either either

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,700
from templates you've got rails you've

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,440
got node there's there's Hugo and Jekyll

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,820
if you want to try try your hand at

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,980
static static web development but then

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,350
there's also different examples across

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,870
gait lab comm if you just go go to the

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,430
application do a search for examples

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,430
you'll come up with hundreds of results

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:32,890
so we're just going to do a a repo

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:36,030
import by URL and we're just going to

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,030
name itself

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:53,880
give it a description said public so I

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:57,330
get all the shiny toys and we're going

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,570
to create that's going to run for a

00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,570
minute

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:19,650
or maybe my Wi-Fi went down yes all the

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,130
megabits thankfully this is being run

00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,590
out on Google's cloud so so hopefully

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,250
that doesn't as long as I have an

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:32,400
internet connection I should be good

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:36,210
okay so we imported another project and

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,910
it's just very very basic there's I mean

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,930
you really cannot read that there's a

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,150
docker file

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,040
there's your server dot RB file for

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:48,360
because it's just a basic Ruby

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:51,870
application and all that's going to come

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,340
in play really quickly here but first we

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,130
want to we want to think about the

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,450
meeting we just had so we're going to go

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,100
and we're going to create an issue board

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,080
and this is this is where that

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,300
visualization of shifting work to the

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,730
left comes in so I don't I don't know

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,620
how many of you you are using agile or

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:13,040
one of the newer development methods but

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:18,090
but there's this concept of backlog

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,460
there's the concept of planned so things

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,380
that have issues out of your backlog

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,600
that have been have been looked at

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,180
they've been they've been weighted

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,530
they've been triage they've been they've

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,450
been kind of vetted out a little bit

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,370
because giving a developer root access

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,080
to your entire production environment

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,690
probably isn't what what you want to do

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,130
as a systems engineer in fact most

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,810
developers I know don't want root access

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,020
because if they don't have access they

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,480
can't get blamed and so there's there's

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,570
backlog there's to do and doing and then

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,060
obviously closed so there's this concept

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,620
about making sure that when when an

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,450
issue hits your board when it hits your

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,850
pipeline to get it through that pipeline

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,510
as quickly as possible and we accomplish

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:03,510
that in DevOps by focusing on as few of

00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,130
tasks as possible because how many of us

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,170
go from all these different applications

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,150
and you suffer from what's called

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,250
context switching and when you context

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,680
which you lose productivity for almost

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,660
23 minutes when you change gears when

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,760
you when you change tasks it takes

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,290
almost 20 minutes before you before you

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,280
hit that project productivity again so

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:27,880
why I'm

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,220
shindig bit earlier about get lab being

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,620
a single application so why does why is

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,290
that why is that important that's where

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,059
contact switching comes in so so far

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,120
we've gone through two steps we've

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:42,700
created our project and we've we've we

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,650
we're going to create an issue now and

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,500
it's all been from within the same

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,910
application one tab in fact you'll see

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,520
throughout the course of this demo that

00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,390
I'm only going to stay on this one tab

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,130
except for a moment where I show you

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,010
that the kubernetes cluster is actually

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,380
spinning up so two tabs but just one for

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,390
this for the sake of the demo and so

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,179
we're going to create an issue and arm

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,040
our CEO wanted us to update the home

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,590
page so we're going to come up with a

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:17,890
super clever issue name and we're going

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:22,929
to update the home page so in that home

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:25,679
page we've got to have tasks so we can

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,820
put in some some notes from the meeting

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,169
and I don't even want to try and type

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,549
anything out because you don't just

00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:36,490
laugh but I do want to point out that

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:39,610
you can actually add subtasks to issues

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,600
get lab issues and comments support

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:47,230
markdown and so all of us that are

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:50,160
writing the the markdown train I think

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,840
all of my notes anymore are in markdown

00:23:50,160 --> 00:24:00,210
so we want to we want to add some HTML

00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,210
coding we want to we want to change the

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:10,809
it's really fun one-handed change the

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:14,620
header in case anyone was worrying

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,240
getting lab supports emojis I know

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,100
that's a big concern when I'm when I'm

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,940
talking to customers they they're all

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:27,220
about the emojis I say that facetiously

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:39,610
but um that's interesting

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:47,320
I hope not again the the fun of doing a

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:49,590
conference demo over over Wi-Fi but one

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,660
thing that the gala

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:55,840
so in labs open core which means the

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,790
most 90 plus percent of the application

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,740
is open source and you can go out there

00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:02,590
you can change it you can in fact get

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:06,429
lab is only about 600 people as a

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,050
company um interesting enough it was

00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:12,640
less than 400 beginning of the year so

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:14,350
we've been growing like crazy but only a

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,200
small percentage of that is actually

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,250
product so there's only so many people

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,350
that we can throw at this application

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,770
there's only so many people that I that

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,600
can actually do development most of our

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,669
contributions most of our good features

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,840
most of our big bug fixes are big ideas

00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:34,919
come from a group of over 2000

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,179
developers people in the community

00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,970
people that work for companies that use

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:41,860
get lab people that just tinker with get

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,020
lab on their own people that were just

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,700
we're just scouring the internet and

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,559
came across the project and said ooh I

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,940
can make a contribution here in fact

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,570
there's a schoolteacher I forget where

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:57,179
he's from but he he he gave a quick talk

00:25:52,570 --> 00:26:00,490
at a recent company conference about how

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,860
he's an English teacher but he likes

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,960
Linux and so he found that he could

00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,669
actually give back to projects by

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,800
working on their documentation cleaning

00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:13,000
up the language

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,500
fixing spelling errors but there's a lot

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,299
of ways you can contribute so some of

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,679
the best features in get lab weren't

00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,669
even developed by people who get a

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,760
paycheck from Gilliam

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:25,330
but from our community and so if you go

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,690
to get lab comm slash get lab - org and

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:31,720
then is the community additions then is

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,840
the actual repository where get lab seee

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,280
lives and I say that because if you're

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,230
using get lab for personal or

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,210
professional use there's feature

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:43,750
requests all over the place for

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,210
four features or enhancements be it for

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:50,830
our issue boards for project pipelines

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:53,380
for our source code manager and we make

00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:57,160
heavy use of the the thumbs-up

00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,840
thumbs-down so once once a once an issue

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,050
starts to get a couple of hundred likes

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,830
or thumbs ups I can't believe I just

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:08,500
said likes once that starts to happen

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:11,440
then a feature really starts to get some

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,810
attention and it gives Minh from the

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,850
community hasn't picked it up then then

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,140
get labs product team really starts to

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,280
look at it goes this is something we

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:24,910
need to address because this is

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:27,850
something our community wants so or in

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:32,770
distant there but okay so we've we've

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:34,390
created our issue and we've found poor

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:38,860
some poor sap who is actually going to

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:40,900
make the change so we've talked about it

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,700
we've we've we've met with appropriate

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,160
teams we know what we need to do where

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,140
we're not using HTML tags or we want to

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:52,360
revise the header so we've we've triaged

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:53,980
it so now me as as the as is the the

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,170
poor sap who got saddled with this issue

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,640
I want to pick that ticket up I'm

00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,320
wanting to assign it to myself and I

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,250
want to move it to doing which means

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,660
that I'm actively working on that issue

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,860
so before I can actually dive into the

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,810
code I've got to have somewhere to

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,410
deploy it to and that's where get lab

00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,940
really starts to shine so what we're

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,730
going to do is we're actually going to

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,620
stand up a kubernetes cluster live in

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:21,640
front of you again what could possibly

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:24,150
go wrong I want to sign into my account

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,150
here

00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:37,360
and give my cluster a name and then so I

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,049
kind of brush there really quickly I

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,029
apologize

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,880
so with get lab comm or get lab

00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:46,360
self-hosted you can actually connect

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,390
native not near natively with GK so

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,269
goober google kubernetes engine try and

00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:54,370
say that five times fast or if you're

00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:55,809
running on AWS if you're hosting your

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:59,860
own kubernetes cluster you can actually

00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:04,990
connect to an existing cluster using the

00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,360
the API URL service token and and just a

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,529
couple of clicks later and you'll have

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,529
one-click integration with your

00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:14,049
kubernetes cluster through get lab so

00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:16,299
when I brush through really quickly but

00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,880
get lab asked me to sign into my Google

00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:21,820
account so I signed into Google gave it

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,460
my password earlier and when did the the

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,440
two FA and then it brought me to the

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,600
screen here and so I gave my cluster a

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,669
name we're not going to do anything with

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,659
environment scope I set it up on the

00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:35,919
right cluster and zone for the cluster

00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:39,399
we want to spend up we'll just go with

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,110
three standard sized notes and we won't

00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:43,750
get lab to manage my cluster so we're

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:47,399
going to create it and this is the only

00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,399
time where I want to leave this tab

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,900
nope you can you can spin up as many

00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:06,470
clusters as you want the caveat being

00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:11,420
the Google will charger but that's just

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:12,770
like any other application okay so the

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:19,370
cluster is spinning up let's see if

00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:19,810
he'll show up on my account now maybe

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,280
not

00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:26,270
alright well I'll talk a little bit more

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:28,640
and then I'll show you okay so on well

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,310
the well that clusters spinning up in

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,950
background I'll walk kind of through our

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:36,080
integration screen so once once the

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,420
cluster is live and once the integration

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,910
has been established you can give it a

00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,390
base domain so if it's the IT guy calm

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:46,130
or whatever the case may be

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,010
you can add that in you can even give it

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,650
a star dot so that it can be

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:55,820
you could have dev my domain calm or

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:57,710
staged on my domain comm and then what's

00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,230
really what's really great about having

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,510
get lab in manage your kubernetes

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,760
cluster is that there's 1-click installs

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,350
for a lot of the major tools so I don't

00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,960
know if you've tried the kubernetes is

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,270
kind of a bear to stand up takes a long

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,800
time is very in-depth unless you're

00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,960
using like there there's an instable

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,530
script project out on github that that

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,820
can do it for you really quick but for

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,640
the most part it's kind of a bear to get

00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,350
going now with git lab if you're trying

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,420
to if you're trying to just keep going

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:29,300
with kubernetes get lab is great option

00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,280
because helm tiller tiller is kind of

00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,790
the the package manager for for lack of

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,050
a better term for kubernetes so once our

00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,140
cluster is up and running we can do a

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,850
one-click install you can install an

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,300
ingress point which i think is just an

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:46,400
engine X pod and once once that comes

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,090
back it'll give you a public IP address

00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,310
from GCP you can install let's encrypt I

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,620
know that's really hard to read you can

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,420
install let's encrypt which will handle

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,060
your certificates you can install

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,830
Prometheus you can install additional

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,620
get lab runners

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,540
Jupiter hub which is great project there

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,559
they're an open source project in a

00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,289
community that are

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,029
to help the scientific community with

00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:14,659
publishing research publishing papers in

00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:16,879
a way that's actually usable and K

00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:20,299
native so if you're doing survey list if

00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:22,700
you're doing functions get lab is one of

00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:24,559
the leaders in that space so that's

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,230
that's kind of the integration screen so

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,759
I can't I can't stress enough unless we

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,470
went through and spent the 20 minutes to

00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,809
actually do it step by step I can't

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,789
stress enough how powerful that is an

00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:37,820
entire kubernetes cluster with package

00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:41,840
manager with monitoring with the ability

00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:45,169
to run in encrypted sites and server

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,610
lists all that just one click this is

00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:48,860
this is kind of how I got going with

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,769
kubernetes really is is just by playing

00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:56,090
with it through collab okay cool

00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:58,429
so GCP actually is you you can see you

00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,559
can kind of see that my cluster spinning

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,720
up and that's tied into a billing

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,220
account and when you start using GCP for

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,659
the first time Google will give you like

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,789
a two hundred dollar credit or a three

00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,850
hundred dollar credit and it's three

00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:13,850
hundred dollar credit Thanks yeah you

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:16,519
really do mine is almost gone but if you

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,809
sign up for GCP through gitlab comm you

00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,269
get an additional two hundred dollars

00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:23,210
it's good for a year so you can go out

00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:27,350
and play with get lab and kubernetes on

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:33,379
GC p4 for about a year for 500 bucks for

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:36,619
free it's it's really great so then it

00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:38,450
takes it depends on how busy GCPs

00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:39,769
infrastructure is but it usually takes

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,749
about five minutes or so and you have a

00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:45,980
live kubernetes cluster and then you can

00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:48,169
actually go into you can actually go

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,789
into the compute engine and you can

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:51,440
actually see the nodes that it's spun up

00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:55,690
you can you can see some of the details

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,690
about it we won't go into that today but

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:04,129
okay so that's not going to spin up so I

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:07,569
was I was kind of smart I had I had a

00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:11,750
moment and I've got another project here

00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:14,300
where I've been doing the same thing but

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,310
I I spun up a kubernetes cluster last

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,659
night because I anticipated in GCP you

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,869
would be busy while I was trying to give

00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,869
a talk

00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:26,060
so this is the same Ruby application if

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,349
the page will load will have I can show

00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,349
you that we've got the same issue open

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,590
so how's breakfast

00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:55,810
so fun fact if you're not on if you're

00:34:52,900 --> 00:35:00,670
not on a on a public Wi-Fi this is

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:01,960
actually really quick and intuitive I'm

00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,360
getting ready to just jump into my

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:13,390
slides here nope there it goes yeah it

00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:15,430
heard me complain okay

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:19,330
I'm running short on time and I want to

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:29,920
make sure it open up to questions and as

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:32,410
you can tell I was okay there we go as

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,470
you can tell I came prepared I expected

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,960
something like this to happen so we went

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,690
to get lab we looked at templates we

00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,410
decided to import our own we imported

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,780
our project so there's one thing I

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:49,510
didn't quite touch on I mentioned Auto

00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,460
DevOps a minute ago and Auto DevOps is

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,790
really a work of the open source

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,610
community go to about not get lab calm

00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:00,070
and search for Auto DevOps this is

00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,950
really an amazing innovation and it it's

00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,450
it's good lab can get lab of the company

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,730
cannot take credit for it because what

00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,410
the auto devops is is this it's a

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:11,080
configuration file that lives in the

00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:16,840
root of your repository and it's get lab

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:19,450
- CI ml who loves animal and what Auto

00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:25,960
DevOps is is is the ability to actually

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:28,750
go through and welcome Auto DevOps is a

00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,370
collection of same defaults that's

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,160
really if you boil it down that's what

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,770
it is get lab - CI y amal is a

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,190
configuration file that has been been

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:41,440
iterated on hundreds of times over by my

00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:45,280
get lab employees by the community by

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,860
people and from all over the world all

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,380
kinds of different backgrounds - how do

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,540
we best build a Python application or

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,880
how do we best deploy a ruby application

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,680
so if you look at Auto DevOps it it just

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,020
goes through and helps you build a sane

00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,250
pipeline this is this is how you build

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,280
this this container this is

00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,260
and it's it's Intuit enough to scan your

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,970
project to know what what language is

00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,190
dealing with is it Ruby as a Python is

00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,710
it C++ whatever the case may be it's

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:16,250
going to actually look at that and apply

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:19,099
a series of scans is going to it's going

00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,210
to set up the build deployment so for

00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:23,330
someone like me who's just getting

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:26,180
started with get lab just just a little

00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:28,510
under a year ago and learning about

00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:32,420
kubernetes for the first time and and

00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:34,040
being not not being a developer this was

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,320
a great way to kind of get started and

00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,880
actually get results because I could

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,470
deploy a template I could play with the

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,160
code a little bit and then I could use

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,530
out our DevOps

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,190
to deploy and I'll show you the pipeline

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:47,900
here in just a second so we we went

00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,640
through and we stood up our kubernetes

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:55,490
cluster we signed into our Google

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,780
accounts okay so once what's the what's

00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,869
the kubernetes cluster is up and running

00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:02,450
and we actually get the the public IP

00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:05,359
address we can we can see where our zone

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,280
is we can see how many nodes we have and

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,050
then we can jump back in to get lab we

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,630
can install all of our one-click

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:14,089
installers so there's there's a public

00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:17,330
IP address for those of you that like to

00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:20,420
heckle me that public IP has actually

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,800
changed since since I wrote this so if

00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,330
you want to try and troll me there good

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:29,359
luck so then I just went out to digital

00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,119
ocean and that's that's where my domain

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:36,080
is is my domains DNS is hosted just plug

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:42,140
in plug in my my my URL and the public

00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:43,550
IP ok so we created our issue apologize

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,650
for the redundancy here I wasn't

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:49,390
expecting my my internet connection to

00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:54,200
be what it was so I picked up the work

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:56,060
so within within the issue itself you

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,400
you saw we added a description we added

00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,960
some subtasks we we added comments we

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,740
gave the issue a thumbs up just to get

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,570
it some some attention one of the other

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,580
things that you can do from within the

00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,710
the issue itself is you can create a

00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,359
merge request and so why is this why is

00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:14,390
this powerful it goes back to context

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,200
switching everything about get labs UI

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,760
design you

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,400
about efficiency it's about making

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,930
things easier so it if you just take the

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,700
industry standards right now you're

00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,130
talking about issue management with JIRA

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,109
you're talking about C ICD with Jenkins

00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,670
you're talking about code repositories

00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:34,040
with github you're talking about

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,390
security scanning with sonar cube you're

00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,290
talking about project management with

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,440
was the big one right now team

00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,359
foundation server some they just changed

00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,859
the name to something as er so I mean if

00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,030
you just look at the industry standards

00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:48,950
what is that just off the top my head

00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,240
that's six different applications and

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,339
chances are you don't just have one

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,280
security scanning tool chances are you

00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:58,190
might have multiple builders so you

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,630
might have Jenkins and Travis CI how

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,030
much context switching are you going to

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:06,650
go through to go from JIRA to Jenkins to

00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:09,230
github to sonar cube but with git lab

00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,910
it's a flow and I really wish that that

00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,160
the demo would have worked because you

00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:15,800
can really see how you go from the issue

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,300
board to creating merge request and what

00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,369
the merge request does is it does two

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,380
things is it gets gets a pipeline ready

00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,119
so that auto dev ops functionality we

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,420
just talked about it creates a feature

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,579
branch and then it ties it all together

00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,470
so if you go into a merge request you

00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:32,000
can actually see the issue that it that

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,710
caused it you can see related merge

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,599
requests and you can see the pipeline's

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,069
that have run and the communication the

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,040
the conversation that has taken place

00:40:37,069 --> 00:40:45,319
around that so I've got a feature branch

00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:48,619
and so we we created our merge request

00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:52,310
and this is this is the this is the

00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:54,280
start of that screen so over in the

00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,930
description line here it says closes one

00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,550
issue number one so if I click that link

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:03,050
it'll take me back to the issue that we

00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:05,750
just created and then you can see you

00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,420
can see a hyperlink into the feature

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,609
branch and into the master branch and

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,599
then get lab took that another step

00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:17,000
further there's a web IDE that in my in

00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,460
my opinion puts Visual Studio code to

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,530
the test because this web IDE works

00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,270
really really well and I don't have to

00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:27,050
leave the same tab that I've been

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:28,350
working in so I open up my web IDE and I

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,960
can see the files and there

00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,950
so I can very quickly see okay there's

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,140
my dockerfile

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:37,260
there's my server our B file I can go in

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,870
I could quickly make a change so I'm

00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,530
going to open up my server our B file

00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:45,360
and all this application does is just

00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,030
display some text on a web page right

00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:51,000
now it says hello world and you can tell

00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:53,940
that when we wrote this application we

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,760
we needed to we left ourselves a note to

00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,230
change that to HTML so let's go ahead

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,090
and do that we're gonna we're gonna get

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,920
rid of our we're gonna get rid of our to

00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,170
do comment and we're going to put just

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,240
h1 brackets and we're going to change

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,860
the change of the text you just said

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,660
hello world we're gonna do hello self

00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,390
cuz you know we're at South East Lennox

00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,900
fest and we're having fun with with live

00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:18,810
demos failing right out of the gate so I

00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,480
mentioned earlier the get lab was based

00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:23,570
on the good protocol it's running it

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,520
under the hood so that means two things

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:29,640
one means that I don't have to do this

00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,410
in get labs UI if I wanted to if I have

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,660
a workflow that worked for me I can do a

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,400
git pull or I can do a git clone just

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,680
like I would anywhere else make my

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,360
changes do a git commit do a git push

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,040
back to the command line I don't know

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,090
about you but I love them and I love my

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,800
femme plugins so sometimes that's just

00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,690
easier if I'm working on a server and I

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,430
just need to make a quick change I can

00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,530
do that from the command line get lab

00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:54,510
will actually take that git push and it

00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:57,270
will still put it through the auto

00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,770
devops pipeline so even if i'm if i make

00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,410
a change in the web UI or if I make a

00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:03,210
change in in the local it doesn't make a

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,220
difference it'll work both ways the

00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,250
other thing is it supports commit

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:12,890
messages just like just like get itself

00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:16,440
so we all love our very indiscriminate

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:19,320
gitlab commits so updates are 4rb but

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,630
then it's also supports commit

00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,520
descriptions so I can I can add in

00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,530
something a little bit more a little bit

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,610
more defined and then I can commit that

00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:31,710
back to my feature branch so now I know

00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:33,630
this is kind of hard to understand out

00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,130
of context but along the bottom of the

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,260
screen when I commit those changes a

00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:40,170
little banner shows up and it tells me

00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,339
that a pipeline was just kicked off for

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:47,759
a feature branch by a particular person

00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:51,069
and so I can click on that pipeline link

00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:52,989
and I can see where my pipeline I can

00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:55,989
see that my pipelines running and this

00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:57,039
is Auto DevOps if if you want to put put

00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:59,140
a mental image of it

00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,180
this is Auto DevOps I didn't write any

00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:06,099
of these phases so I've got a build

00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:08,469
phase and that's showing me the get lamp

00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,719
runner spinning up I can see that it's

00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:12,549
using my kubernetes namespace you can

00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,680
and then down towards the bottom how

00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,900
many of us get so tired of watching

00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,249
docker containers built but you can

00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,049
actually do that live from within the

00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:22,089
pipeline or you can just sit here and

00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:24,279
watch the little blue blue circles fill

00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:27,339
up and then when is done turns green

00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:29,589
moves on to the next phase again I

00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:31,689
didn't write any of this this is just I

00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:33,999
enabled Auto DevOps for my project and

00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:35,739
it goes oh I'm using a ruby application

00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:37,689
I'm going to need a ruby container build

00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,910
it clone clone the code into the

00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:41,589
container now we're gonna run tests so

00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:45,039
there's our SAS says there's our

00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:46,449
container scanner and then I can

00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,130
actually go in and I can watch those

00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:51,939
container scans run and I can see if

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:54,160
there's any issues my job's exceeded so

00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:57,069
then when the pipeline is done it'll

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,630
turn green and I'll be left with

00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,779
something really really unique in the

00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:03,519
industry I'll have a review app so if I

00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:05,829
don't necessarily need to maintain

00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,449
multiple infrastructures anymore I don't

00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,640
have to maintain a separate dev

00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:11,439
environment instead all that can be done

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,099
on the same infrastructure using the

00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:16,630
same cluster using tags so instead of

00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:18,670
having multiple versions of my

00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,160
application where the infrastructure

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,739
might have drifted instead I can use a

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,249
review app and what that is is it's just

00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:29,289
a container that has a complete copy of

00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:31,509
my application and all the libraries and

00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,119
everything that go with it then I can go

00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:35,769
in and compare a to B this is what's

00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,559
running in master this is this is my

00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:41,880
production to my review app this is this

00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:45,339
is how look after I make my changes and

00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,769
this then shows up under environments so

00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,999
the the top line is my review app the

00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:51,099
second line is my production environment

00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:54,670
and what's really cool is these little

00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:56,110
green boxes those are indicators of pods

00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,610
so I can actually look

00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,970
and see how many pods are running and

00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:02,890
see the health of each of those pots I

00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,540
can launch a terminal into those into

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:07,570
those pods themselves and run

00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,960
Diagnostics pull logs or I can launch

00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:12,490
into the actual review app so on top is

00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,410
master that's what it was before and

00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,900
then I can see that it's in my future

00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:20,950
branch much easier to read and much more

00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:23,590
appropriate for the event so once once

00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,630
that pipeline is done I can come back

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:27,910
and I can actually set up my application

00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,740
to where if I'm doing cocoa developing

00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,360
if I've got another developer that I'm

00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,190
paired with or paired development is

00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,720
what it's called if I'm if I'm pair

00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,000
developing with another with another

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,770
person I can add them as an approver so

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,540
they have to come in look at the code

00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:45,040
look at the comments look at the review

00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:47,530
app and then and then give their get

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,010
their consent and then once that's done

00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:52,510
I can actually say that I can resolve my

00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,280
work-in-progress I can say that this is

00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,100
done this is ready to go back into

00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,730
production and because of Auto DevOps

00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:02,170
it'll actually it'll actually I can

00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,790
delete my source branch and I can merge

00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,320
that back into production which will

00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,630
kick off a second pipeline which will

00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,180
run another build exactly like it did

00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,080
before it'll scan my my code one more

00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,870
time

00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,400
the big the big ask on the second one is

00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,460
just to make sure that nothing has been

00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,260
merged into production while I'm working

00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,240
on this issue that would then create a

00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:26,080
conflict because how many of us hate

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,540
doing get conflict resolution so it's

00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,670
it's actually going through and doing

00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:35,020
the build doing the tests and then

00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:36,430
deploying to production and then then

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,230
something I didn't point out on merger

00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,090
quest screen is when you resolve that

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,860
merge request it'll actually close the

00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,840
issue that you're working on it'll mark

00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,780
the merge request as a result and it'll

00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,370
close the issue so I don't have to get

00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,020
that call on Friday morning from my

00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:51,970
project managers going hey you said

00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,160
you're gonna get this done this week why

00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,410
haven't you worked on this oh I did I

00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:02,380
just didn't close the issue get lab does

00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:04,590
that for you so let me jump back up into

00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,970
my slides I won't get this wrapped up

00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,450
again I apologize for the technical

00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,450
issues

00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:19,240
so kind of can't the take away something

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,200
that I want you to think about is what

00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,520
do you want to spend your time working

00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,920
on do you want to spend your time

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,250
working on redundant error-prone tasks

00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,690
do you want to spend your time working

00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:33,369
on issues that could be automated or do

00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,920
you want to spend your time working on

00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:39,339
something do you want to spend your time

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,810
automating and and trying trying out new

00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:45,460
applications do you want to continue

00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:47,560
learning because I like to tinker I mean

00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,150
I like to play with something figure it

00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,010
out once I've kind of learned it I'm

00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,900
good I'm ready to move on to learn

00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,329
something else but if I can do that

00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,670
process and then automate that and then

00:48:55,329 --> 00:49:00,310
put it into a tool like git lab so where

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,980
then other people can come and make code

00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:05,849
contributions or utilize that code and

00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,170
then I can move on to something else I

00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:10,210
feel like that's that's better for all

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:14,310
of us that improves work like balance

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:16,420
that increases job satisfaction that

00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:18,849
helps give back to the community because

00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,530
all this can be public or you can set it

00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:22,900
to private or only allow certain people

00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:28,359
to access these repositories it's really

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:29,950
up to you so we're open source we like

00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:32,230
open culture we like open source and

00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:35,349
just as a quick disclaimer I built this

00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:37,800
this this demo using my system 76 laptop

00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:41,589
running arch linux with libreoffice

00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:43,240
firefox and good luck so you know I'm

00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:48,460
not going to stand up here and get my

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:50,410
talk with a macbook but I know the

00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,619
screen was hard to see in the the online

00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:56,770
demo didn't work but if you go out to

00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:59,410
HTTP GET lab comm slash Eric the IT guy

00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,150
slash talks and you can actually see

00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,160
this talk and some of the others I'm

00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,630
giving so you can get the slides and

00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,690
kind of walk through what I did because

00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:09,849
that's really it's really just great

00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:13,510
opportunity to see what get labs about

00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:15,730
see how a single application for your

00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,650
entire development process can help make

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,580
things easier reduce context switching

00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:22,900
and

00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:25,480
and and provide a more seamless provide

00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,340
a more seamless experience so with that

00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:33,930
being said I've got time for a couple of

00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:33,930
questions yes sir

00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,650
so Auto DevOps is scheduled to run

00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:47,230
uncommit so when something changes it'll

00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:49,390
run a pipeline but with a get lab runner

00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:51,670
you can schedule them so if you have a

00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,079
nightly job that runs and redeploys your

00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,490
development or environment or something

00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:56,589
you can schedule pipelines that way so

00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,849
the question was can you can you

00:50:56,589 --> 00:51:08,109
schedule pipelines and the answer is

00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:10,210
definitely yes yes sir okay so the

00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:12,700
question is how does the kubernetes

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:15,549
cluster stand up it's not using coops

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:18,400
right to my knowledge yet lamb is just

00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:20,769
calling out with the with the demo that

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,160
I showed today get lab is just calling

00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:26,890
out to GC p when GC P is just standing

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,019
up a few compute nodes and and then

00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:30,940
spending up a coop master so however

00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,589
however Google Cloud is deploying their

00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,599
communities clusters that they're there

00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,009
on demand clusters that's that's all

00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:39,990
we're doing good lab is just making a

00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:49,720
call to their I'm assuming it's an API

00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:53,140
sure okay so so the question is is there

00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,759
plans to add any other providers so

00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:58,239
right now get lab is the only one we

00:51:54,759 --> 00:51:59,200
have integrations with but for a very

00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,210
long time now

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,470
and if if you see them I think Jason

00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:08,230
plum has a lot to do with this but for a

00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:09,789
while now get Lab Enterprise Edition has

00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,529
actually been available as a one-click

00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:14,470
deployed droplet on digitalocean

00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:16,569
this great way Grau it's been probably I

00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,420
would recommend it probably one of the

00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:23,380
$10 droplets go out spin up get lab play

00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:26,650
with it for a while and then also just

00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:29,700
recently I think a week ago get lab is

00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,869
now available on on Amazon Marketplace

00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:36,039
the same way it's just kind of a

00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:37,210
one-click deploy I don't know if there's

00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:38,950
any integrations right now with

00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:42,309
digitalocean and their kubernetes and

00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:45,759
get on digital ocean but but that's

00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:47,410
where that when we were standing up for

00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:50,289
kubernetes cluster there was the two

00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,609
options I went with Google Cloud because

00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:53,380
I thought that stood a better chance of

00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:55,569
working

00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,460
there's either Google cloud or you can

00:52:55,569 --> 00:52:59,319
add an existing cluster so if you go out

00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,700
to digitalocean spin up a kubernetes

00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:02,619
cluster there or if you've got one on

00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,319
your home lab you can actually just grab

00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:07,450
the API token the URL there's a couple

00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:10,900
of other things you can add you you just

00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:14,230
it's just copy paste send and it builds

00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:17,190
that integration just the same got time

00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,190
