This talk centres around my experience and observations (as a consultant) entering different corporations. I have seen many common themes from people who feel trapped working in one company because they don't know what companies are looking for and how to match this up with the skills they currently have.

Everyone struggles with self worth as we hear of all the cool things other companies and people are doing. I am here to tell you, you are worth more than you know! I'll give some examples of tasks you actually perform and how you can pair them up with your dream job
