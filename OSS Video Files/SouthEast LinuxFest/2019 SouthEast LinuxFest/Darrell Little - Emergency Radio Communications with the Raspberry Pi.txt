hey testing okay all right yay

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,299
I had a lot of trouble with the

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,120
microphone yesterday with a lot of

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,060
feedback so we're in better shape so

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,810
good morning thanks for coming to a

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:53,549
early Sunday morning session here my

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,650
name is Darrell Ben here with the with

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,069
the special event station out in the

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,579
hallway and so yesterday I talked about

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:05,790
some different open-source software that

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:11,459
runs on Linux for ham radio and digital

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:14,700
modes and briefly talked about when link

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:19,199
mm so I'm diving in a little bit deeper

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:25,110
than on that topic today specifically

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:29,789
for using a Raspberry Pi to do emergency

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:34,229
communications out in the field if

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:38,639
you're ever deployed for for an

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:43,430
emergency so how many how many people

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,650
are familiar with when link 2000 system

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:52,229
okay well okay good so okay well I'll

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:55,410
eat at least one okay so and and I find

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:57,780
this also kind of about the same at the

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,470
the the Radio Club or I'm at up in

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,770
Roanoke and gave a presentation a couple

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,510
months ago and kind of sparked some

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,300
interest once people learned a little

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:15,690
bit more about it but it's it's a it's

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,789
an amateur radio email system and you

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,650
know the name wind link well it's made

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:25,500
the software's mainly written for

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:27,599
Windows so sorry about that but but the

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,789
the the Windows software is called win

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,599
link Express if you want to if you if

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,820
you go to win link Oregon you can look

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:41,669
up the Windows software the the wind

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:45,719
link express to to download and if you

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,320
go into the setup your account name is

00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,750
your call

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,760
sign so like when you set up when Lync

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,710
Express for the first time and you're

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,180
connected to the Internet it will get

00:05:52,710 --> 00:06:03,360
you set up with an account within the

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:08,820
wind link system but there's lots and

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,760
lots of packet nodes and HF nodes around

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:17,840
the world that you can connect with and

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:21,000
send and receive email over the air so a

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,200
amateur radio volunteer that has set up

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,870
a node on the system creates what's

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,750
called an RMS a radio mail server and

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,810
it's so it's a dedicated computer with

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,620
an internet connection and a radio and

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,810
of course appropriate Atena it's just

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:45,570
sitting there listening for connections

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:49,520
from client systems to to check check in

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,520
get their mail and send mail

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,870
so you know how is it used I think I

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,150
kind of did I skip over slide yeah I I

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,890
quick so there and I'm not sure how

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,060
recent that map was made but that's

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,580
that's that's just the packet stations

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,260
that are up and running and if you go if

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,020
you go to the wind link org website

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,510
under tools they have they have like a

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,440
list so you can see the current list of

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:27,530
the stations that are up and listening

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,340
both to meter packet and on HF and it'll

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:39,710
list what frequency and which modulation

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:41,240
method they're listening on but so you

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:46,160
know for for emergency communications

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,680
then it's it's been a very proven

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,670
communication methods at a disaster site

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,770
when when you don't have any internet

00:07:51,670 --> 00:08:00,230
you don't have any cell phone service if

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:04,790
you have a set up to get on HF with with

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,670
wind link you can you can you can

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,740
connect to a node somewhere else

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:17,000
geographically that does have internet

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:18,980
access and and the one the one little

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,310
tiny caveat there is kind of like the

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,440
cart before the horse kind of thing is

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,750
well how do you know what stations are

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,790
listening and on one frequency if you're

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:35,479
in a disaster area and you don't have

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:37,669
internet connection in in the at so I

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,470
would I would say in the event that you

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,140
are going to be deployed to a disaster

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,090
area I would like get a list and print

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,180
it out and make a couple copies and take

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,880
it with you where you're gonna deploy so

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,290
you know what your frequencies are that

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,700
you want to try to connect to you once

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,720
you get to your to your site where

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,190
you're going to be providing

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,960
communications but with the wind with

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,410
the wind link express software there's

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,620
actually a way to get the list of

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,740
stations

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,600
of nodes over the error and we

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,130
experimented with that and it's quite a

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,910
long list and it takes several minutes

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,710
for it to download but but you can

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,380
actually get an updated list over the

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,890
error so they've kind of thought of that

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:30,120
situation and have kind of brought that

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:34,350
into their into their software so how

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:38,220
many people remember like two meter

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:41,220
packet radio and BBS s okay

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,710
so quite a few so it's it's it's using

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:50,160
the same packet protocol on two meters

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:54,110
and then on HF it's using a protocol

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,610
called wind more there's also a

00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,630
proprietary modem called a pact or and

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,560
they're quite expensive

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:11,070
and they're there to me they're really

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:13,800
geared more commercial use but but I the

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,480
cost of those packed packed or modems I

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,000
think a little bit prohibitive for

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,920
amateur use especially for volunteers so

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,650
that's why they developed the wind more

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:29,760
software so that you can have a software

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:31,920
TNC instead of a pact or hardware TNC

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,930
and there's there's a new protocol

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,830
called art up and I hope I'm pronouncing

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,750
that correctly that's that's how I see

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,930
it it there's supposed to be an

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:47,340
improvement more efficient and better

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:50,820
protocol so when more I think is

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,360
eventually being phased out in favor or

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,790
adopt

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,040
but when you when you go to the to the

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,830
website and look at the list of HF nodes

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,500
you'll you'll see in the listing which

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,320
which are they listening are they using

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,150
win more or they use an r dot and kind

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,040
of match that up with the the modes that

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:12,960
you can operate and so you know for

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,480
emergency communication it is caught on

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,560
it's really it's grown quite popular

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,150
especially compared to older traditional

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:28,410
methods of passing messages

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:30,840
voice email is less prone to error so

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:35,460
here's the traditional the the

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,350
old-fashioned ARRL radiogram I can't

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,350
honestly say that I've ever actually

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,050
used that we and some of the club's I

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:46,710
belong to we have done some practices

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,890
where we actually pass traffic from and

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:56,840
for an exercise but I've never actually

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:59,970
passed emergency traffic by voice and

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:04,140
the traditional packet radio setup you

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,790
know a PC the the right kind of serial

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:12,390
cable from PC with a db9 serial port to

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:16,590
your TNC and then the proper cable to

00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:19,800
get from the TNC to your radio but

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,940
hardware TMC's are still around you can

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,940
still find them you can go to

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:18,410
test their okay very good all right now

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,600
lost my train of thought oh I was just

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:25,370
comparing okay the old traditional way

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,840
to do packet radio and oh yeah I know I

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:32,990
was talking about TNCs you can still

00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:36,770
find TNC is like a tempest the the TNC

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:39,020
that used the db9 serial ports are being

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,220
replaced nowadays with what's called a

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:47,330
TNC X and it's a is the TNC designed to

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:52,510
use USB instead of that db9 serial port

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:54,470
so yeah I mean there may be especially

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,380
amongst this group there might be people

00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,810
with some some older hardware that still

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,970
have db9 serial ports on them and you

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,000
can set one of those up for to dedicate

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,060
for a packet station but the TNC X is is

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,780
a newer newer kind of TNC that uses

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:18,290
serial ports USB serial ports so so my

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,420
main topic of discussion and and not

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:25,790
what I've brought that's up here in the

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:31,940
front for a demo is using a Raspberry Pi

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:34,760
and a hat a hat for a Raspberry Pi is a

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,870
board that plugs in to the GPIO pins on

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,890
the on the Raspberry Pi

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:46,030
attea it's called TNC PI so it's a TNC

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:51,050
hat that actually plugs right on to the

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:55,700
Raspberry Pi and then I went ahead and

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:57,680
got the the cable that plugs in to just

00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:04,910
write the standard Kenwood style

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:08,120
microphone and speaker plug on on HT so

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:12,760
in in the example and the demo here that

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:16,060
I've got a an HT that puts out 10 watts

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:20,570
which works very well if you're in

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:22,780
fairly close proximity to a TNC a packet

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,780
node

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,589
now I was there there is a packet note

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,760
here in Charlotte and I programmed in

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:34,260
its frequency and callsign and I try to

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,050
contact it while I was preparing but I

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,610
didn't expect to being inside in here

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,550
that was going to be able with ten Watts

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,660
be able to get in contact with them you

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,279
know I didn't want to bring in a hundred

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,329
watt radio and you know and give

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,829
everyone RF radiation exposure so so

00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:54,209
we're keeping it to ten watts or less

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:58,589
for the demo here but the advantage of

00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:03,570
this kind of outfit for for packet is is

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:08,000
very portable with with the Raspberry Pi

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:11,420
you just need a five volt to power it

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,370
what I have in my outfit is I have a

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,550
sealed lead-acid battery 12 volt battery

00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,949
with a buck converter that drops it down

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,889
to five volts that I can plug in and I

00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:26,610
can run the Raspberry Pi for two or

00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:29,310
three days if you're using it sparingly

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,579
and so I could be portable with the

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:37,110
battery running the Raspberry Pi and in

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:38,970
operating and and and it's a lot less

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,170
expensive than buying a full-blown

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:51,810
laptop or a desktop PC and a hardware

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:55,680
TNC so this here's the the the company

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:57,889
that that has that the student that

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,699
developed the software for the PI gate

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:06,240
also has available the the files the 3d

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:09,870
print a case so here's a picture of a

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,750
Raspberry Pi with the TNC PI in a nice

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:17,549
little case and portable you can take it

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:20,010
around coastal chip works is the company

00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:23,459
that developed the Hat for the the PI

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,620
the TNC PI and I think they also they

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:32,460
are also one of the companies that have

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:36,139
the th CX the USB hardware TNC but

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,509
that's kind of a little picture and

00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:40,700
when a wrap-up everyone can kind of come

00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:43,850
up and look at the demo there and kind

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:48,440
of see what it looks like but that's

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:54,619
doing that's doing all the packet work

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:57,259
for you so the the gentleman's ham radio

00:17:54,619 --> 00:18:03,080
operator that developed the pie gate

00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:04,970
software was you know trying to

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,519
brainstorm what's what would be a good

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:15,499
way to roll up everything that you need

00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:17,960
to to give people at a at a site access

00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:20,029
to send email out like health and

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:27,100
welfare messages that people just send

00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:30,700
emails out so he's using the ax 25

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,139
that's that's built in to the raspbian

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,509
Linux

00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:37,369
he's bundled in a web server and a

00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:41,119
webmail client I think he's using

00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:43,789
squirrel mail and the whole he's done

00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,580
all the work he's he's configured

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:50,840
everything all you have to do is just

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:53,269
download the the image and flash it to

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,129
your SD card for your Raspberry Pi and

00:18:53,269 --> 00:19:00,440
so you've you've got a PI gate basically

00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:02,929
just for the cost of you know putting

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:08,419
together the hardware buying the PI TNC

00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:10,669
and I'm I'm sure it would be nice to and

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,289
it's something I need to do I need to

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,940
make a little contribution because I've

00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:17,090
been I've been taking this out on the

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,690
road and and showing this I should give

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:24,909
a little back but here here's a just a

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,909
brief kind of flow of how it's working

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,159
people at the shelter with their

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:34,549
smartphone or if they have a tablet or a

00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,289
laptop with them and in keeping in mind

00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,090
you're probably in a disaster area so

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:41,029
there's not there's not probably not

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:44,179
Wi-Fi and there's probably not cell

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:47,690
phone coverage so the when you fire up

00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:49,170
the PI Gate software it's actually

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,220
creating an access

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:55,530
on the Raspberry Pi and you you you give

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,350
the people their on-site what the the

00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,500
password is to connect to the Wi-Fi on

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:04,260
the PI gate and then they just open up a

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,700
web browser and and go to you give

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:10,650
everyone the IP address they go to and

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,650
give them like a username password for

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:17,270
them to use and then the rest of the

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:22,530
diagram there he's kind of showing how

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:25,410
how the rest of it flows and I won't go

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:28,140
a lot of the details back because I

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,800
could probably put people to sleep but

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:36,510
the the main thing there on the far

00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,880
right is I'll when when they send then

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,610
it goes out into a queue and then the

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,300
radio operator that's that's running

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:51,440
operating the PI gate then will connect

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:57,030
with with with a node on packet radio

00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:02,370
the TNC PI going over VH VHF and then

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:05,750
sending out the emails so the trick

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,890
there is to manage is that it to be

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,290
having a system set up that you're

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,480
giving the people at the shelter aid

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,910
that you know the Wi-Fi password the IP

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,340
address and then and creating a username

00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,590
and password for them to you to log in

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,250
to the PI gates so that they can they

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:28,710
can browse to the to the PI gate and

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,300
compose an email and that's basically

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,070
what I just said in the site I should

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,010
have went to the next site already and

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,900
so the outgoing email then sit in it sit

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:42,690
into a queue into the radio operator

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:48,950
then connects and sends out and it's its

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:52,410
outbound only but once once it goes out

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,770
once the PI gate connects to the the

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:59,550
packet node in that in the area that you

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:02,550
can access those there's outgoing emails

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,260
go into the wind link system

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,120
then from that from that node you've

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,460
connected to then it goes out to the and

00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,220
gets delivered to where the people are

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,700
trying to get get the emails to and

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,050
email reply is our Arnold loud it's

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,780
actually got like a little default

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:23,250
message in the email saying do not reply

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:27,090
kind of thing because the the emails are

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:30,210
going now under the the radio operators

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:33,690
callsign so so you're using your wind

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,240
link 2000 account to to connect to when

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,730
link 2000 and you're sending outgoing

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,020
email on on their behalf

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,460
so you wouldn't want people replying

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,680
because then you'd be getting everyone's

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,780
personal their replies coming back to

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,820
them but the main service you're

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,190
providing then is health and welfare

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,890
messages that people can get messages

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:59,210
out to their loved ones let them know

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:02,070
where they're at and that they're okay

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,590
so the pie gate system then like I

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,680
mentioned you can you can 3d print your

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,020
own case there's some there's some

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,140
people out there that have custom

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,810
printed cases that you can get and you

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,930
can even find completely assembled kits

00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:23,310
all put together for you with a little

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,440
built-in touch screen display like a

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,960
three and a half inch touchscreen

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:32,970
touchscreen display with a fan and the

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,850
tnc pie I think at the completely

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,160
assembled kit all made up for you I

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:41,360
think get it's like one hundred and

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:46,860
eighty dollars or something like that so

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,770
but the pie gate net is is the it's the

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,870
gentleman's website where he's got all

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,590
the information you can download the

00:23:51,870 --> 00:24:00,000
image to flash and build your own if you

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:02,310
want so in in my demo here what I've

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,430
done is I've taken the official

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:11,960
Raspberry Pi seven inch LCD display and

00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:14,640
a smarty pie case I think runs about

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,380
twenty eight dollars the Raspberry Pi

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,110
seven inch LCD screen

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:23,850
is $60.00 but it gives me a nice little

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:26,360
standalone raspberry pie with a with a

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:29,430
display so I don't have to haul around

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,980
you know LCD monitor or anything so

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:35,970
everything's all self-contained and I

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,340
went ahead and got the the the cable

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,170
with the db9 connector on one end and

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,900
the Kenwood style plug on the other end

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:48,300
to plug into an HT and then the antenna

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:52,260
that I'm using then is just a buddy Pole

00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:54,330
deluxe set up as like a 2 meter J pole

00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,390
configuration and it gets out pretty

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,390
well

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:05,430
so that's really it for my presentation

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,930
I both of my presentations have been

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,290
kind of short and sweet but I'm leaving

00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:13,680
time for questions and people can kind

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,480
of come up and look at the stuff I could

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,440
maybe try a couple more times see if I

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:23,460
can actually make a make a connection

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:27,300
but anybody have any questions or and I

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,680
explained it so well that everybody's

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:33,840
gonna run home and go build their own

00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:37,550
pie gate right but after after seeing a

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,750
little bit about wind link I mean

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,340
anybody's slightly interested and maybe

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:46,230
finally maybe learning a little bit more

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:48,330
doing some emergency communications like

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,240
I said it the local club that I belong

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,620
to up in Roanoke it's certainly kind of

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,640
spurred some interest have been about

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:59,190
five six members of the club have have

00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,380
gotten an interest it's a it's kind of

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,240
like a little it's you know how with

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,850
amateur radio there's so many different

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,740
things that you can try to do so it's

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,780
just it's just kind of another little

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,730
slice of the hobby that you can maybe

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:19,620
learn more about and and and maybe

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:23,670
volunteer with your local areas

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,880
organization and have you know a rig

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:29,820
like this that you could provide

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,249
communications with so

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,729
I'll be I'll be putting both of the

00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:37,979
yesterday in today's slides up on my

00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:40,679
blog probably Monday or Tuesday after I

00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:43,759
get back home and I'm glad to answer any

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:49,409
emails anybody has any questions

00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:51,840
interested in finding out more but yeah

00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:54,539
so I'm done early so give you some time

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,489
back some some time to you can check out

00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,609
and look at the the demo we can see

00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:02,279
maybe we can make a connection and thank

00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:04,970
you for for stopping by

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,970
and listening

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,020
you

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,780
you
