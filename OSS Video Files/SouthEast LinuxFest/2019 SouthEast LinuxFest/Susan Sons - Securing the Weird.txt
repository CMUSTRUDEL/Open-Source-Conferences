	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
Information security is usually focused on web servers and email, laptops and mobile devices.  What happens when the things that need securing are volcano-top telescopes, oceanic drones, research vessels, and Antarctic sensor nets?  Veteran information security professional Susan Sons describes working through the security needs of strange and challenging science and R&D technologies based on first principles.

if we have time I might tell the story

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:16,650
of how one of those got stolen by Somali

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:20,119
pirates okay know though if you ask the

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,119
Pirates that's a whole other story

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,529
getting started welcome to securing the

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,810
weird

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,940
I'm Susan suns and this is a talk about

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:35,910
mental models that can help you secure

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,780
things and deal with technologies and

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:44,760
situations that are unfamiliar this is

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,890
my day job I secure a number of things

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,469
that get dropped in my lap by everyone

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,050
from DHS to the National Science

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,770
Foundation to I've worked on projects

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,370
for Department of Energy for private R&D

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,660
for the Department of Defense and I love

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,629
it because I get to work with all of

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,030
these interesting technologies but let

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,119
me tell you when you have sensor

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,760
networks under the Antarctic ice when

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
you have a really cool telescope with a

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,119
special laser I don't know if you can

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,710
see the laser beam coming out of that in

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,200
the time-lapse it's really cool that

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,210
makes fake stars in the upper atmosphere

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,820
for telescope calibration when you have

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,979
autonomous underwater vehicles and ships

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,950
with their own internal ICS and SCADA

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,320
networks that have tons of scientific

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,229
instrumentation and only a dban

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,150
satellite signal going out or any of the

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,619
other weird things that I work on it

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,100
usually doesn't come with a best

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,420
practice list so suck in the cool photos

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,070
because this is going to be your last

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,990
science photo till the end and the way

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,460
I'm approaching this for this talk is a

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,320
little bit different than what you may

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,610
have seen before because I'm not going

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,460
to pack a bunch of technical

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,130
cybersecurity skills or InfoSec skills

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,659
into your head in one hour

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,310
the reason I'm not doing that is there's

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,069
only so much I can teach you in an hour

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,629
and I don't know what everyone's walking

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,069
in with we're going to have some people

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,650
who are really familiar with the

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,740
discipline and some people aren't

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,570
instead

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,060
I'm going to try to teach you three

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,070
mental models that get me through this

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,050
kind of work and that can apply it to

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,200
many other types of technical work where

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,060
you have to deal with unknowns so here's

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,250
the rough road map here I'm going to

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,340
start with why check lists alone aren't

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,370
sufficient why mental models are a

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,800
useful way to approach complex tasks I'm

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,240
going to show you three mental models

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,830
and then I'm gonna wrap up with ways

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,490
that you can use this in your own work

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,560
and of course time for Q&A and feel free

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,320
to interrupt me at any point if I use a

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,180
term you're unfamiliar with or if you

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,740
come up with a question I'm totally cool

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,620
with being interrupted it keeps things

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,320
interesting and because I move through

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,140
so many communities day to day one day

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,180
it's DoD the next day it's scientists

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,700
the next day it's the hacker community I

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,500
pull words from all of them and I don't

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,810
even think about it it's like people who

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,670
just mix their native language in with

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,320
English and then the other language that

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,310
they learned in college and forget that

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,770
other people don't know all four

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:20,910
languages that they speak it's a bad

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,970
habit call me on it so second section

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,980
one is there be dragons I spend a lot of

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,190
time off the map where best practices

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,370
list just can't save you sometimes

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,750
there's just just no list like I said my

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,790
wonderful telescope that has the special

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,070
laser on this is really cool this is one

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,200
of my favorite parts of this telescope

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,750
installation the reason that this

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,270
telescope gets this is the Gemini

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,330
telescope by the way the reason that

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,210
their photos from on top of Mauna Kea

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,360
which is a dormant volcano in Hawaii are

00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,900
as clear as Hubble telescope photos

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,470
despite being taken from Earth is they

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,280
have a computational system that will

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,930
measure the distortion being introduced

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,650
to a picture by the movement of the

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,370
atmosphere and compensate for it and the

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,130
way that they do this is if any of you

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,340
have watched stars twinkle stars don't

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,380
really twinkle what you're seeing is the

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,970
steady light of a star filtered through

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,140
the movement of the atmosphere and

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,570
looks like stars twinkle and if the

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,820
telescope takes a picture of a star near

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,980
to the thing that it's looking at by

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,870
measuring the twinkle of the star it can

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,560
tell what movement of the atmosphere it

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,380
needs to compensate for to get other

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,730
things in space into a clearer picture

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,740
the problem is there isn't always a

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,800
distant star near the thing that you're

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,920
trying to take a picture of so sometimes

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,950
they make one they have this really cool

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,590
laser that will basically cook bits of

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,170
potassium in the upper atmosphere to

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,750
make them glow and now they have a fake

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,920
star and they can watch it twinkle and

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,020
they can tell which way the atmosphere

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,640
is moving and they can calibrate their

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,150
system and they can have a very clear

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,800
picture it's pretty cool but let me tell

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,020
you that does not come with a security

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,310
best practices list I had to make this

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,410
up when I got there and a lot of times

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,169
we get caught up in what I call death by

00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,060
checklists people have this blind belief

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,680
that if there are directions and they

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,930
follow the directions they're doing it

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,880
right and I'm a huge fan of checklists

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,280
when used correctly and in a later

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,140
mental model I'll get to how you build

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,930
checklists so that they're more likely

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,720
to be used correctly but when I talk

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,550
about death by checklists there are a

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,440
couple of things that commonly go really

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,780
really wrong first of all people are so

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,090
desperate to have a checklist they will

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,800
take a checklist that was not built for

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,960
the situation at hand and apply it

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,220
because it's a checklist and therefore

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,190
it must be better than having no

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,410
instructions whatsoever the next thing

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,350
is people will not understand that

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,120
checklists are foreknown situations and

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,720
when they encounter an exception they'll

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,040
fail to deviate from the checklist and

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,350
the third thing that tends to go

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,720
horribly wrong is people accept a

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,550
checklist without actually reading into

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,800
it and finding out if it's reasonable or

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,400
not because it's a checklist it must be

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,260
good I don't let any of these things go

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,510
wrong in my projects when I can help it

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,090
but it helps to be really aware of this

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,160
and also to have concrete ways to

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,960
short-circuit it because the way to end

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,400
up with death by checklists and I'll get

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,900
into this when I talk about people

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,410
models

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,860
is that people want a framework to work

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,410
on so that they don't have to recompute

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,170
re figure out what to do every time they

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,600
do a task and that's a smart thing

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,520
that's a good instinct it increases our

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,980
ability to do something correctly when

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,620
we have to do it many times you don't

00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,620
sit down and really reason about how

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,880
should I brush my teeth today

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,650
nobody has time for that you get up and

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,120
you brush your teeth the way you did the

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:16,620
last four thousand times you brushed

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:18,390
your teeth right so these are a lot of

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,550
the things that I'm just kind of

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,470
accustomed to at this point um working

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,180
with science is weird and that's why

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,550
I've had enough practice at this that

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,650
I've developed these mental models one

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,660
is low or no connectivity like I said I

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,850
have a ship that generates tons of data

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,470
and it has this incy wincy dban

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,510
satellite connection out to the world

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,860
and that's all it's got and by the way

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,470
if the weather is bad enough that just

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,280
goes away not that they don't have

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,710
bigger problems in rough seas extreme

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,050
temperatures um one of those facilities

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,760
you saw on my picture is called Ice Cube

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,380
that's where they gather the data from

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,420
all of these sensor nuts under the

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,720
Antarctic ice where they're doing

00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,750
measurements of neutrinos so really

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,940
delicate science and I love when people

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,460
tell me oh just push out a new firmware

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,070
load it'll be fine

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:10,500
no I have to wait for the thaw it's

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,860
under the ice in Antarctica it's not

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,990
that simple in my world dealing with

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,810
saltwater in sea air which can be very

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,570
corrosive to computing equipment um

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,100
dealing with volcanic activity some of

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,670
my projects actually have to worry about

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,920
that

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,160
seasonal access to equipment like I just

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,610
mentioned for Ice Cube not designed by

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,020
IT professionals here's a really fun one

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,140
working with the science community and I

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,390
run into this in DoD as well you have to

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,390
get a design approved and funded before

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,000
you're allowed to hire IT professionals

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:48,540
so you could have soldiers or scientists

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,580
designing a system and then later they

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,080
bring in someone who you know actually

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,280
does IT for a living and has some

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,230
experience at this

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,090
so you have to work around the things

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,710
that went wrong in that process before

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:03,450
an IT professional was even in the story

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,000
often we don't control the network let

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,950
alone everything on it some of the work

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,770
I do is with science projects that are

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,200
honed at major universities so the

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,720
university owns the network one of the

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,580
problems we've had to solve is how do

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,320
you do network monitoring when you don't

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,880
own any of the network hardware and

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,470
you're not allowed to access the span

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,260
ports that's just our life we learn to

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,050
work around it and another interesting

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,820
thing is not in all of the communities

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,400
that work with but particularly when I'm

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,980
working with open science nobody usually

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,750
cares about confidentiality your worst

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,760
case scenario is you're trying to keep

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,410
your pre-publication data secret so

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,400
nobody scoops you on something that's

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,950
coming up in a couple of months but

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,200
overall if scientists if you're like

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,760
data exfiltration I'll I love when a

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,950
vendor tries to sell me some product

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,290
that's gonna stop data exfiltration and

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,450
my scientists are like no take my data

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,190
can I help you take my data I can't

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,170
believe you're interested in my data can

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,630
I tell you about my data can I buy you

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,070
dinner and bore you about my data no

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,530
some of the data is actually really

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,530
interesting but this is the response

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:16,710
from scientists please take my data can

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,810
I have a citation needing my data okay

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,490
we put my name on it after you take my

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,670
dad and like that's all I want you can

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,370
have my data and that's life with open

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,589
science they really care about integrity

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,890
they really care about availability and

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,870
confidentiality what's that so it's a

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,339
different world to work in and boy do we

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:42,330
confuse security vendors let me tell you

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:43,589
please take my data so what is a mental

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,690
model and why do I think these are

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,760
important enough to share on the

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,650
definition from Wikipedia is up here I'm

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,300
not going to read it to you as if we are

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:56,760
in the sixth grade but basically we

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,760
think about doing repetitive tasks or

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,130
processes on a computer once you've done

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,320
it enough kind of know how it works

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,480
what's the first thing you do you script

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,930
it right men

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,920
models or scripts for the human brain

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:16,199
these are ways of thinking about complex

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,410
problems that break them into variables

00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:21,779
or elements that we understand how they

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,579
relate to one another so now we have

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,430
something where instead of walking into

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:29,399
a jumble or a mess I have pieces I can

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,279
manipulate and it's a very powerful way

00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,079
of reducing complicated situations into

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,519
something that you can work on very calm

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,740
very confidently over and over so as I

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,480
go into new situations I start building

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,839
mental models to deal with situations

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,610
that are like that and most of the

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,370
brightest most adaptable people I know

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,949
have a huge collection of mental models

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,220
that they've just adopted created or

00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:57,959
learned from other people over time and

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,160
that's how we take really complicated

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,829
things that you can't do with a

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,889
checklist especially things that require

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:06,420
human analysis and reasoning and put

00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:11,730
them into something that starts to have

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:14,220
a structure so the three mental models

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,110
I'm going to introduce you to our first

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,089
of all the information security practice

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,069
principles which is a way to do

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,470
information security from first

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:25,800
principles rather than relying on

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,810
getting too far into the weeds where the

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,819
knowledge that you have expires when you

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,990
move from working with one technology to

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:35,880
working with the new technology what I

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,260
call three minds and how to use them the

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,920
cowboy the engineer and the

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,529
anthropologist this is a way of looking

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,240
at a complicated systems problem and

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,440
making sure that you're covering your

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,029
bases and not just moving too fast

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,149
dropping things or only seeing part of

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,459
the problem I find this especially

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,260
helpful when I don't have my entire team

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,540
to work with because I consider a lot of

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,459
them to be a safety valve I work with

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,399
people who think differently than I do

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,860
and when I do not have that safety valve

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,769
a way that I help myself

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,750
think and analyze better is to sort of

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,000
have these caricatures and say I'm going

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,920
to think this way first and then I'm

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,110
gonna try to take go back and do the

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,230
same problem with this mindset and then

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,870
I'm gonna try it with a

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,760
mindset and that gives me some of that

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,880
360 view that I might not have had

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,700
otherwise and the last one is the

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,770
concept of evidence-based information

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,200
security how do you get from something

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,480
that is a special snowflake all its own

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,970
to something that's repeatable by other

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,950
people who don't live in working chaos

00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,070
like I do how do I make normal people

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,690
able to do this and then at the end when

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,200
we get past the mental models we'll talk

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:55,900
about using this so working from first

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:58,450
principles by the way speaking of first

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,270
principles everyone who attends this

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,710
talk is going to get one of these handy

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,520
rough cards with the information

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:08,770
security practice principles on it and

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,200
the first people who ask me really good

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:18,100
questions at any point in this talk are

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:21,760
going to get books so start thinking so

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,530
we have seven principles here and I'm

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,600
gonna do a really quick run-through on

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,880
what they mean and how they play out but

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,090
all information security can be derived

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,070
from these seven principles my team and

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,040
Indiana University's Center for Applied

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,840
cybersecurity research spent a lot of

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,670
time hashing this out in a lot of

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,560
research because when we started looking

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,240
at how do we really do this how do we

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,940
figure out how to secure something that

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,590
nobody's secured before we realized that

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,870
there were some principles at play and

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,310
then we started to realize as we looked

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,840
for resources we could use in

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,210
communicating this with others they

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,830
hadn't ever really been documented this

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,550
was hard-won knowledge from people who'd

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,020
been in the trenches a long time so this

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,120
was the outcome of a really long

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,540
research project that you'll get the URL

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,780
to learn more about later comprehensive

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,460
'ti covering all your bases a perfect

00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,490
example of comprehensive 'ti is

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,310
end-to-end encryption too often we see

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,230
situations where ok the connection from

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,560
the client to server is encrypted that's

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,560
great

00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,029
it's unencrypted on the server and then

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,550
it gets encrypted again to send to the

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,500
other client but it's okay if we attack

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,950
the server we'll get everything totally

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,839
cool um comprehensive 'ti is really

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,990
about looking at everything because an

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,449
attacker finds the weakest point they

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,720
only have to find one flaw as defenders

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:50,310
we need to look after all the flaws

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,170
opportunity is a big one that I see is a

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,990
huge failing in our industry right now

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,209
because let me tell you when a group of

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,029
script kitties find out about a new

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:03,209
exploit they're passing it around so

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:06,060
fast I've seen things go from we heard

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:08,730
of this to turn into a Metasploit

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,380
package and active attacks across three

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:16,079
continents in less than six hours it

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,910
happens here on the defender side we do

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,720
not share information that freely in

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:26,010
that widely we just don't and it is

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,589
often our downfall a lot of its fear um

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,240
people don't want to say what they're

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,680
afraid of and what their liability is

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,240
because they're afraid somebody they're

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,240
talking to might be one of the bad guys

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,280
yep people are real are often is afraid

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,070
of to listen as they are to talk and

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,010
there's this fear of being wrong in it

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:19,520
being my fault that happens a lot in

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:22,220
industry especially because we've really

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,050
because many parts of our industry are

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,600
older and further along than information

00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,160
security is we've conditioned people

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,310
that it's safe to stick to known

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,400
processes and so much around InfoSec is

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,650
kind of knew that everything looks risky

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,150
and people don't know what to do the

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,400
other thing is there seems to be this

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,960
pervasive belief that if we shut up and

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,380
don't tell people what we're concerned

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,290
about no one will make an exploit for it

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,360
and that is so not true

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,920
I saw wonderful I can't tell you the

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,110
entire contents but I saw a wonderful

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,450
government produced chart that had like

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,610
this pyramid with the difficulty of

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,320
different kinds of cybersecurity threats

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,300
and you know at the bottom there's the

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,940
stuff that bored kids and script kiddies

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:09,620
do and it goes all the way up to at the

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:12,740
very tippy top state actors except where

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:16,190
do you think they put zero-days state

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,530
actors do you know how many 0 days I've

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,270
seen discovered by a board 14-year old

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,490
who just pushed buttons because he had

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,610
nothing better to do on out for hours on

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,380
end and this yet many of them because

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,550
it's mildly more amusing than minecraft

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:36,140
and is approximately the same waste of

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,880
your time so but but they were

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,500
absolutely sure that zero days are

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,450
something that come from state actors

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:47,000
and I was just baffled by this and it's

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,630
they seriously seem to believe that most

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,580
information security attackers we're

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,950
just not gonna come up with zero days if

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,700
they shut their mouths don't talk about

00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,430
it and that's really sad because there's

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,140
so many opportunities we miss you have

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,200
no well maybe you know because some of

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,450
you do similar work but I go into so

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,040
many situations and clients and say okay

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,650
we're gonna start securing this where's

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,570
your network max where's your software

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,100
architecture diagram they have the whole

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,290
court advantage and they can't tell me

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:23,310
what they have you know they just why

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,110
would you give that up

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,580
it's your terrain you should know it

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,670
better than everybody else

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,680
you know invading forces should be at a

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,570
disadvantage but too often they're not

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,220
because we're wasting that opportunity

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:40,380
we're not taking advantage of our

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:42,800
environment so and by the way I owe you

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,920
a book for the first question

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,740
the so rigor what's correct behavior and

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:54,900
how am i ensuring it an example of a

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:57,930
rigor rule is never trust the vendor my

00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:03,270
vendor says all connections to this

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:06,180
device are encrypted by default trust

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:09,390
but verify exactly

00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,980
I believe me I'm going to be sniffing

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,570
everything in and out of that device to

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,700
find out if they really are encrypted

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:20,160
and how also it means following up on

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,430
people one of the things that I

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,200
frequently see in organizations is that

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:28,410
and will get to people problems later on

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,200
but I frequently find out that okay it's

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,020
great we have a security policy it makes

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,400
sense we approved it and we put it in

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,750
the drawer and we didn't bother to tell

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,410
anyone about it that's a lack of rigor

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,270
if you have a security process or policy

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,220
and you haven't told anyone about it I

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:51,660
how many of you work in an organization

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:58,860
made entirely of psychics anybody cuz I

00:20:51,660 --> 00:21:04,800
sure don't we might have a few psychos

00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,540
but I haven't confirmed that yet but but

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,970
seriously these are failures of rigor

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,470
rigor is about checking on things it's

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,230
about monitoring and it's about

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,120
follow-through if you think you're gonna

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,070
do something that's not enough you have

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,510
to actually say you're going to do it

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,510
and then you have to actually do it

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:50,210
yep-yep test that it fails correctly and

00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:53,299
that gets us down to fault tolerance

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,409
number six minimization and I'm gonna

00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,349
make you all listen to my favorite

00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,059
minimization story cuz I'm not so I feel

00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,309
like a bad mother I have a favorite

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:03,859
among my children but I do in its

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:08,899
minimization because I get to be more

00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:12,679
secure by doing less work I like this I

00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:14,929
like doing less work so here's a great

00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,239
example many of you by virtue of coming

00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:22,399
to self before are familiar with the NTP

00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:25,070
security project when the NTP SEC Fork

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:27,080
started we had just gotten through a

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,999
rescue where a lot of the build tools

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,279
code accessibility and stuff were

00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:33,169
straightened out we hadn't gotten to do

00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,059
any major architectural changes at this

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:38,179
point from the original codebase and

00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,979
what we call NTP classic was continually

00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:42,320
maintained under its old development

00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:44,119
principles so we had this interesting

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,340
case study because we started with the

00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:50,539
same code and then it was maintained

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:53,119
using two separate strategies okay and

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,679
the NTP set crew in the first year

00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,019
really didn't have time to do a major

00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,639
rewrite X because they had so many

00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:00,889
moving parts and things to deal with

00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:02,809
getting the project up and running but

00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:04,489
what they did do is remove quite a lot

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,759
of code code that was theoretically

00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:10,869
unreachable code that supported hardware

00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:15,580
that no longer existed on the planet

00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:18,320
code that supposedly had already been

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,869
rendered out of so that it would never

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,899
compile but could compile under some

00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:26,179
circumstances coat that wasn't actually

00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,799
getting used but had been left compiling

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,460
in for reasons we didn't really

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,460
understand

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,710
they were compiling code that no that

00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,000
should never run because the logic of

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,690
the rest of the program should never

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:51,270
call it okay yeah if false do this

00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:53,580
things like that so but there are

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:57,780
glitches things can reach theoretically

00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,480
unreachable code so by around the same

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,310
time that this fork was started there

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,610
was a college professor who decided that

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,590
NTP being the aging codebase that it was

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,900
would be great fodder for some of her

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,160
software security students so she set

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,930
them loose and said see how many

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,540
software bugs you can find in the NTP

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:20,070
reference implementation and boy those

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:22,440
bugs started rolling in the thing is not

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,180
giving NTP I'm not giving into pset

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,270
credit for any of the security flaws

00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,060
that we found in fixed ok I'm not even

00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:32,220
counting those only counting the things

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,580
that we did not know about until they

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,720
were disclosed by a third party

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:41,400
NTP SEC dodged approximately 85% of the

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,190
security vulnerabilities through

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,470
minimization alone through removing code

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:49,440
they didn't need but that had been left

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,570
in the codebase that's incredibly

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,390
powerful I'm gonna maintain less stuff

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:58,520
and be more secure I love that I'm gonna

00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,520
have fewer interfaces and be more secure

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,590
absolutely removing packages from your

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,240
operating system counts as minimization

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,580
minimization means being a smaller

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,340
target retaining less stuff the bad guys

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,900
want don't hold on to data you don't

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,640
need why are you collecting people's

00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,820
social security numbers do you really

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,770
need that data or did somebody go crazy

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,300
with the input form let's stop and think

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,330
about this how long do you really have

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,430
to retain that data so one of them is

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,300
being a smaller target the other one is

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:35,250
about having a smaller attack surface

00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,950
having less code having fewer services

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,750
running having fewer ports open having

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:44,310
fewer machines that can talk to one

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,240
another compartment ation is another

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,480
what I kind of consider the

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,570
architectural principles compartment

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,150
ation is having discrete parts that have

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:57,060
limited known interfaces this is about

00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:00,360
having good tight carefully defined

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:05,690
internal and external api's this is

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,970
about network segmentation this is about

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:13,260
not storing your highly critical secret

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:15,860
data in the same place that you put your

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,670
promotional video game for your company

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,560
because the people who should have

00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,990
access to these files are probably very

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:26,190
different they should probably be in

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:28,590
separate worlds so that's what

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,470
compartment ation is about fault

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:34,740
tolerance what happens if this fails

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:38,390
everything fails your firewall may be

00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,390
great but one day it's gonna have a bug

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,230
yeah what happens when this fails the

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,180
someday it's gonna have a bug your

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,640
software may be great someday it's gonna

00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,900
have it bug more than one thing should

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,250
have to go wrong for a crisis to happen

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,250
this used to be how we thought about

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,470
complex systems if you look at how

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,200
nuclear regulation is set up everything

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,210
has a failsafe and the degree to which

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,280
you need fail safes depends a lot on

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,290
your actual application domain

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,330
I don't expect a video game to have the

00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,720
same level of fail safes as a medical

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:19,590
device these are very different things

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,570
but let's stop and think here even a

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,610
video game company stands to lose money

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,370
if one thing going down takes down their

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,700
entire server Network right they still

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:33,210
have failover they still have backups

00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:36,240
what happens when this fails and finally

00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,520
proportionality is this worth it I can

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,770
make your computer perfectly secure okay

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,140
it's never gonna get broken into this is

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,390
gonna be fantastic I'm gonna get my

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,490
sledgehammer and I'm going to break your

00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,100
computer into eensy-weensy little tiny

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,560
bits and then we're going to encase the

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,140
bits in cement and then we're going to

00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,840
drop this cement computer bit ball down

00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,230
to the bottom of the Marianas Trench

00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,700
this is fan

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,110
fantastic nobody can even do data

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,230
recovery on that by the time the

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,340
seawater gets to it unfortunately you

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,429
won't be getting a whole lot of work

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:13,380
done either but that's just a minor side

00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:15,780
effect right yeah not so much the idea

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,790
of doing information security is to

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,559
further a mission if you're at a

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,720
university if it's an educational

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,280
mission if you're in a company it's the

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,260
company's mission and the company's

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,100
profits and the company's ability to

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,900
continue to employ people if you are on

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,669
a science project it's going to be

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,500
discovery what are you trying to

00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,440
accomplish here and how do people trust

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,510
your science if you're in the military

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,130
it's going to be a military mission but

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,900
there is some mission that you're trying

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:47,850
to ensure continues on you know um

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:50,790
someone recently asked me about the

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:53,940
security of GPS systems and we mapped

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,620
out of Buick a few emergency scenarios

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,260
and the various things that can and

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,179
often do go wrong and they said you know

00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,950
but we're looking at and they showed me

00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,470
all the vendor options for backup

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,630
systems that are ever more complicated

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:09,120
technologies and I'm like so you realize

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,400
that for 20% of the price of that you

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,990
can buy really high-end maps and

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,710
compasses and train all of your people

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,309
in basic orienteering right just a

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,000
thought

00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:27,090
and the guy looked at me with such a

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,510
stunned expression because we're talking

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:34,890
about a fairly rare scenario in which

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:36,540
the GPS system is largely down working

00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,140
around that from a technological

00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,790
standpoint is complicated failure-prone

00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,890
inexpensive but what do you really want

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,840
do you really want your GPS units to

00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,740
keep functioning or do you really want

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,760
to know how to get from here to there

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:56,340
just for the record they bought the

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,740
compasses but that's what

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,750
proportionality is about it's also about

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,200
as security people going in and not

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:06,540
being the bad guy because there is this

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,159
archetype out there in the world of the

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,169
security people being there to tell you

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,860
you can't do that you can't do that you

00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:13,260
can't do that

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,870
it's not secure that's not what I'm here

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,780
for you have a job to get done I want to

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,280
know what your real goals are and then

00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,260
we'll figure out a way to get there and

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,970
we'll figure out how much risk we can

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,809
handle and what we can and can't do and

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,000
what it costs

00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:28,260
that's what proportionality is about and

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,710
we're not going to do it if it's not

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,840
worthwhile so these are things we use

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,309
the principles for and I apologize I

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
thought I picked better colors that

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:42,270
would look better on a projector it's a

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,880
little hard to read this URL has a PDF

00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:48,000
of the ref cards I'm going to give out

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,059
if you'd like to print them it also has

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,130
a free downloadable academic white paper

00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:56,790
on where the principles came from and

00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,110
how we came up with them and it's got a

00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,850
lot of other information on the

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,950
principles and will tell you when we do

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,419
trainings and things but these are some

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,730
of the things that we use the principles

00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:08,669
for competently a big one is

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,710
communication the PI cannot

00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:15,330
underestimate the power of getting the

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:17,850
lawyers the c-suite the SIS admin's the

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,230
programmers the security people and

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,880
everyone else throughout the company

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,960
using the same words to describe what

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,960
they're trying to accomplish

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,919
that's what DevOps was supposed to be

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,770
but they didn't really accomplish it

00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,660
when it came to security we had

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,330
especially when it came to roping in the

00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,040
policy folks in the c-suite because what

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,470
happened was we may have gotten the tech

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,120
people fairly integrated but it didn't

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,580
make it up to the business risk level

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,380
and for managing a lot of security

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,720
threats they still didn't have a shared

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,669
vocabulary um

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,320
strategy we always have to talk about

00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:57,230
trade-offs and we always have to talk

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,309
about what are we going to invest in and

00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,530
what are we going to value more than

00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:03,809
something else this gives again that

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,240
shared vocabulary and the ability to say

00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:08,520
what are the trade-offs okay I'm getting

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,770
more rigor I've built in more monitoring

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,690
but I've also created more points of

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,870
attack because now I have sensitive data

00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,640
in more places it gives people an

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,860
ability to really start to analyze those

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,929
trade-offs it's a like I said it's a

00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,640
mental model for things it gives us an

00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:24,960
organized approach that can be shared

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,630
for having these

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,029
Russians root-cause analysis is a great

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,309
one because so often I hear from

00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:34,860
security people well we found the cause

00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:42,270
of that breach somebody didn't pass

00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:45,690
Apache struts okay let's go back and

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:49,140
talk about this let's talk about the

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,059
fact that a bug in Apache struts lost

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,490
your entire user database and all their

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,010
financial information because you didn't

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,600
practice fault tolerance and there was

00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:00,140
no real fall back and there was no real

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,710
monitoring to know that it was happening

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:06,360
let's talk about minimization why is all

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:12,659
this stuff installed on my database

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:14,279
server let's talk about opportunity why

00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,990
don't we have an asset inventory that

00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,669
told us that we had Apache struts

00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:23,039
installed let's talk about rigor why

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,570
wasn't anyone installing updates across

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,600
the board on everything we had that

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:32,190
needed to be updated let's talk about

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,960
proportionality is anyone even really

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,940
aware about the risk levels within our

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,860
infrastructure and how they map to our

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:43,110
actual business purpose that gets us

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,049
back to root cause analysis because too

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:48,450
often systemic problems don't get fixed

00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:51,029
because somebody finds a nasty symptom

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:54,860
and writes it off as the cause this

00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,860
helps us get closer to root causes

00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:01,919
architecture is a big one I'm a huge fan

00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,840
of fixing architecture because just like

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,630
I used in my minimization example with

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,389
NTP SEC I can't find every security bug

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:12,119
I am really really good and I will not

00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:15,510
find every security bug but what I can

00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,159
do is constantly bring things closer to

00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,740
an architecture that will have fewer

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,560
bugs and then I fix the bug that I find

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,889
and that gives me a lot more bang for my

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,080
buck

00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,050
and it's a lot better than playing

00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,300
whack-a-mole because you can't find

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:33,359
every bug but if you get rid of code

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:38,520
you're not using any bugs in that code

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,240
just became irrelevant if you separate

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,889
critical

00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,560
parts of the code from the rest of the

00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:46,550
codebase this now means that you can

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,379
make fairly safe changes to things like

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,980
data storage without screwing up your

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,330
crypto and let me tell you most people

00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,580
on your team you don't want am working

00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,080
on your crypto you probably don't want

00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,619
to be doing your crypto in-house unless

00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,300
you're a very special snowflake it also

00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,710
helps with evaluating tools and

00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,600
standards remember when I talked about

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,460
checklists and said that one of the

00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,160
problems is that people blindly accept

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,990
checklists without evaluating them one

00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,750
of the saddest things for me is to go in

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,850
as a security expert in the aftermath of

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,760
a big breach or another big problem and

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,530
I'm looking at this team in this case it

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,869
in the case I'm thinking of right now it

00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,580
was a DevOps team and they were all just

00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:29,670
crestfallen they're like we think we did

00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,770
everything right and they're showing me

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:35,130
the best practice list from the vendor

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:37,950
of their product and I read the security

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,590
best practice list and for the record

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,150
the product was WordPress that

00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,770
ultimately caused the breach and one of

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,320
the things that WordPress tells you is

00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:51,780
all of these executable files must be

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,580
writable by the web server yeah I see

00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:59,040
people cringing out there and you should

00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:04,350
be yeah a number of people cringe at the

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:06,180
term WordPress but so they had followed

00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,430
every best practice on Mord presses

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,369
security guide unfortunately some of the

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:14,300
best practices were wrong they were

00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:17,070
simply wrong there were poor choices and

00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,950
they didn't know they didn't know enough

00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:23,609
security and know that this was wrong

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:26,730
but if we look at our list here let's

00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:29,160
consider this a web server that has

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:31,740
right access to all of the executable

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,630
files in your CMS while we have a

00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,430
problem with compartment ation because

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,430
this is definitely not a separation of

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,130
concerns this is like that guy he is the

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,720
CEO root on everything even though he's

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:47,820
non-technical because he's the boss and

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:51,200
he said so this is not minimization you

00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,200
have not minimized your attack surface

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,880
this is definitely not fault tolerance

00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:58,739
because anything that can get the

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,839
webserver to write things can now

00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:05,819
execute arbitrary code on your machine

00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:08,069
with elevated privileges if you know

00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:13,619
this you know when the list is wrong and

00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:15,479
that's why I love this mental model so

00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:19,709
this is how far we've made it we have

00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:24,209
two mental models to go the cowboy the

00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:26,699
anthropologist and the engineer so I'm a

00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:28,349
fan of policy on most tech people won't

00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:32,130
tell you that they love policy but I

00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:33,749
love policy and here's why I love policy

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:37,229
for those of you who've ever played like

00:37:33,749 --> 00:37:39,569
fantasy RPGs having a really

00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:44,249
well-written policy is like knowing a

00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:45,329
bureaucrats true name it's what do you

00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:47,309
mean I can't do that

00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,329
it's in the policy right here and they

00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,109
just go away

00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:54,209
it's like magic it's wonderful in

00:37:52,109 --> 00:37:56,400
hackers don't always realize this polit

00:37:54,209 --> 00:38:00,329
this power because we're like okay it's

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,329
a policy but it's dumb but no it

00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:05,459
completely works so getting involved in

00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:08,160
policy so the policy is smart is

00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:09,719
actually really really helpful but

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,369
policy only helps you with the things

00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,989
that we saw coming you can't write

00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,549
something in a policy if you don't know

00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:16,829
what's going to happen which is why

00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:19,259
while written policies have exceptions

00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:21,209
and if you take the mind when you write

00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:24,599
policy that this is for all the things

00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:26,279
we planned for and all the things we

00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,019
didn't plan for we're going to have to

00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:29,900
improvise and are not in this policy

00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,099
you're gonna be in a good place and

00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,529
that's when we come to the cowboy in the

00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,499
engineer and again I apologize for the

00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:40,890
readability the cowboy is ready to jump

00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:43,559
into any situation is comfortable acting

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,269
on incomplete information the cowboy

00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,130
inspires change and when the Cowboys

00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:50,249
done the cowboy rides off into the

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:52,920
sunset because that's what the cowboy

00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:54,690
does the engineer makes results

00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,660
repeatable even by those who are less

00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:00,390
skilled than him or herself the engineer

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,599
ensures correctness the engineer creates

00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,720
steadiness and the engineer plans pet

00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,820
when these two things

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,190
come together whether it's a team

00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,500
working together or a person who can

00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:15,880
handle both mindsets it can be an

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:18,520
unstoppable force because what happens

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,349
is being able to analyze the situation

00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,150
and deal with the fact that you don't

00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:24,369
know everything but create steadiness

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,720
for others gives other people confidence

00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:29,320
and they can calm down

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,420
they can be productive and helpful being

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,000
able to create the change you need right

00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,740
now while knowing what's going on so

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,990
that you can make it repeatable later is

00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,160
incredibly powerful because the cowboy

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,690
doesn't want to be there to keep the

00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,280
trains running on time and we'll talk

00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,760
about a mental model for this in the

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,550
last mental model but this is a really

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,859
important balance and it comes back to

00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,990
the cowboy I'll make sure it gets done

00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,810
right right now while we're in an

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,490
exigent circumstance the engineer will

00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,140
make sure that whatever happens there's

00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,540
a post mortem we figured out why it

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,520
happened what may have gone wrong

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:07,810
how fix it in the future and build it

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:12,910
back into the policy for next time so

00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:15,250
didn't I mention an anthropologist when

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,500
it's not just a one-off if it's a

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:20,830
pervasive technology problem it's almost

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,630
always really a people problem and I

00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,660
have seen this time and time and time

00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,660
again

00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:16,010
apologies to her ever has to edit this

00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,050
video as I was saying pervasive

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:22,360
technology problems are pretty much

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,360
