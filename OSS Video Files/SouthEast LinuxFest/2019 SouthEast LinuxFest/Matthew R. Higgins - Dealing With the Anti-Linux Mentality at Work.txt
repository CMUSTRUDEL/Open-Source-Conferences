Whether it is is a manager who “just doesn’t understand” or a colleague gifting you with his critical wisdom of Windows 10’s superiority to your chosen Linux distribution, it is a safe assumption that a majority of Linux users have all experienced OS-based criticism at some point in life. Considering the typical mentality of the instigator, these instances can be frustrating and difficult to deal with, especially if you are the only Linux desktop user in a company of Windows and Mac users. If not handled properly, these situations can negatively affect your reputation as a cooperative and competent employee. Additionally, improper handling of these criticisms can negatively impact the reputation of the Linux/FOSS community. In this presentation, I will use several simplified principles of linguistic discourse analysis to discuss ways that Linux/FOSS users can approach these inevitable confrontations and turn them into opportunities to provide these Linux critics with a potentially new image of the FOSS community as a whole that is perhaps less intimidating or exclusive than they previously believed when making critical comments.

this is a really really fancy word that

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,639
refers to the fear of penguins so our

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,009
little friend tuxes

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,179
apparently intimidating to some and this

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,800
is a really really fancy way of

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,410
referring to people who just flat-out

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:26,609
don't like Linux but uh I'll see you

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,710
soon Society or all kidding aside this

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,470
talk I'm gonna break down break this

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,829
group of anti Linux people down into two

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,960
general categories the first is the

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,629
people who are afraid of using Linux and

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,809
then the second group is the people who

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,489
actively don't like it and have a reason

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,289
for not liking it other than they're

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,000
scared of it they think it's a bad thing

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,550
to the world yeah starting with those

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,649
who are afraid of Linux you're gonna

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,399
hear them say things like I'm not smart

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,760
enough to use Linux I don't know how to

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,559
use the hackers blackbox as I've heard

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,760
it called one too many times which we

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:12,780
call terminal or bash oh whatever

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,640
what be and then they'll hear things

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,799
like just Linux is too advanced for me

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,439
kind of the same thing as I'm - I'm not

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,430
smart enough and then the people who

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,890
just don't like it

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,009
people who think Linux is a bad thing

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,549
for the world pretty sure there is this

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,500
90s Windows conference that somebody

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,799
said Linux is a cancer don't remember

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,570
people names but putting that aside I

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,060
think we can all agree that's not the

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,250
case but they'll say things like Linux

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,869
sucks and not the bryanl undo kind of

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:48,750
way Linux sucks more like the Linux's I

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:54,450
guess I cancer in people shouldn't use

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:56,759
it kind of Linux sucks they'll say

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,770
things like to use specifically or other

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,829
Linux users why go out of your way to do

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,500
something on Linux when you can do the

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,950
same thing on Microsoft Windows or Apple

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,929
what bu and then despite it being

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,800
classified as software though say

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:17,320
Windows is better Windows is more secure

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,360
heard both of those before both of which

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,720
in my department at Georgia State

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,690
University we won't get into names of

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,760
course though for the sake of anti

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,740
slander mentality but focusing first on

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,840
the people who are afraid of Linux just

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,660
because they're easier to talk to most

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,960
of the time they don't have this mental

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,960
wall up that's just making it impossible

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,880
to talk some kind of reason into them

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:51,100
first thing which I guess goes for both

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:53,380
types of Linux haters is keep your the

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,130
discussions that you have about Linux

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,420
low-stakes if you're in like if you're

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,340
working on a project with a group of

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,050
nine or ten people and you have a

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,080
manager who's in charge of it all who

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,520
never used Linux before and you're all

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,709
going into this meeting you have a

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,730
deadline everybody's stressed because

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,590
you have a problem you see you being a

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,230
Linux user see a Linux solution to this

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,330
problem and you want to bring it up but

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,870
when everybody's so irritated angry and

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,760
a mass group and probably the other

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,570
eight people plus the manager using

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,900
windows or maybe a Mac but bringing

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,610
bringing up this very different or in

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,370
their mind very different solution is

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,280
going to be a serious red flag they're

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,080
going to be thinking well hold up we're

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,299
gonna have to go back into almost start

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,200
from square one which may or may not be

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:50,200
the case but you know that you can get

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,390
further with Linux and the way I would

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,980
approach this is try and get a one on

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,950
one with that superior figure who can

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,390
make these decisions happen and just go

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,130
maybe go into their office shoot him an

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,410
email and just be like hey I think I

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,700
found a Linux solution here or if we use

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,980
this distribution to do this use this to

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,310
release the product instead of a version

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,560
of Windows or something I think we can

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,320
get this project done a lot faster a lot

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,570
better and what happens when you do this

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,820
on a one-on-one that manager who's in

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,680
charge his reputation as the authority

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,680
figure in the room isn't going to be

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,860
challenged when you say like hey we're

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,169
do

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,270
this wrong I think we need a I think we

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,539
need to switch to Linux and do this this

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,050
way you're basically telling him he's

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,789
wrong

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,990
and nobody likes to be told they're

00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:42,939
wrong so that's how to just be shut down

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,069
really fast and if you keep pressing

00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:50,020
pressing the issue it could lead to job

00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:54,310
loss depending on the extreme the

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,530
extremity to which this is pushed but it

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,240
just keeps minimum it just keeps adding

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,139
to the thickness of the wall that

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,460
they're putting up against Linux so

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,740
another thing that when you go and talk

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,650
to that authority figure about hey we

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,659
should use Linux for this or it's an

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,430
option that we can explore bring a

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:14,710
demonstration you're not going to have

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,349
the final product obviously because if

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,949
your Linux distribution solved

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:25,000
everything then like I think I would

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,009
think that you probably would have went

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,060
to it a while ago because that would

00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:32,319
mean you wouldn't have to do much work

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,550
at all but being able to show that Linux

00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,930
has the potential to solve more problems

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:40,990
than you've already fixed that shows

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,289
progress and it gives the manager or the

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,560
team as a whole a reason to agree to

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:50,800
explore that option further so have some

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,550
kind of demonstration obviously keep it

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,219
simple people who haven't used Linux

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,589
before they're either thinking it's too

00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:02,259
advanced or it's still in that 1998

00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:05,589
phase that's to the average person is

00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:09,039
just completely unusable but as we all

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:14,620
know it's come such a long way even in

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:17,289
the past four or five years so that's a

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,150
great thing but keeping concepts really

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,939
simple and explaining what things in

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,199
ways that even if they are programmers

00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,139
may be explaining it in ways that

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,699
programmers and developers don't

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,599
typically think maybe the average

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:35,259
non-programmer thinks it can establish a

00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:41,199
ground that more people can walk on so

00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:43,330
to speak and the final thing which is

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,250
also pretty important we all have to

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,280
swallow our pride at some point in our

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:51,130
lives and just accept that what we want

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,160
to the like 100% entity isn't going to

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,750
happen and when when it comes to picking

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,180
a lot extra beautician Linux

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,000
distribution to use it work for an

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,380
entire team of developers or whatever

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,210
you're doing or department of computers

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,660
sometimes your favorite distribution if

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,580
you're a narcs Arch Linux user that's

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,600
probably not going to be the best thing

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,130
to use when you have a group of like 20

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,229
or 30 people who have never used Linux

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:23,590
before in their lives and I'm sure you

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:26,889
could set it up for them but in reality

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:30,400
a bun too might be the better option for

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:33,630
that group of not so computer literate

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,669
behind the scenes type of people and

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:42,520
maybe if you're in a Bunter Ubuntu user

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:45,520
or Debbie and what be you sometimes when

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,550
in a development setting there's just no

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,470
way around acknowledging that fedora hat

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,030
does have some strengths in there it's

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:58,300
usually pretty up-to-date with current

00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:02,169
software and it always is at least to

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,330
some extent bleeding edge and developers

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,760
like that but at the same time if you

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:10,660
need something more stable than that

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,340
looking to sent OS or other reputable

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,770
one-cent OS is just the first one off

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,979
the top of my head cuz I guess I'm a Red

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,860
Hat guy those those type of

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:23,440
distributions might be something to

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,830
consider and maybe you really really

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,990
hate Red Hat maybe you hate rpms

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:34,890
but it's Linux and it's not Windows so

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,930
it's it's a step in the right direction

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,969
bonus tip a lot of times you have to

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:43,510
keep in mind certification processes

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:46,630
when doing development for software

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:50,760
hardware whatever you're doing and then

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:53,050
if you throw Windows distribution on a

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,010
piece of hardware you've worked on and

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,560
offer support for

00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:01,630
it's gonna be a real pain at this point

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:04,510
to offer support for that piece very

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,130
long because for one the two stable ones

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,920
that everybody loves to use Windows XP

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,600
Windows 7 licenses are getting really

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,870
hard to find XP mode in Windows 7 if

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,260
Windows 8 has it it's nice but it's not

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,260
exactly the same and even still XP

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:28,240
64-bit I mean it had it had its issues

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,850
too so also if you really are irritated

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,980
by that tool MRC telemetry thing Windows

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,830
7 is if you've taken security updates

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,190
it's no better anymore so think about

00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,470
that or go read the updates and all the

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:46,450
legal jargon and you'll see what I mean

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:49,000
when is 10 it's not stable sure there's

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,400
the what is it the professional version

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,350
where you can delay updates out for a

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,200
few months that's still not stable

00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:01,330
you've got to find something that can

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,720
maintain you can maintain and not have

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,800
to worry about updates or ensure that

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,990
the updates aren't going to break

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,640
whatever you're working on and if they

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,660
do break you can go back to that

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,010
previous version of the software and for

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
the sake of it had to throw Mac's in

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,790
there

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,260
why pay that's probably not the right

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,020
number but essentially ten thousand

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:26,710
dollars for a computer and then another

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:30,100
thousand dollars for the monitor stand

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,120
not the monitor at the stand if any of

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,970
you have seen that you know what I'm

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,520
talking about when you can for that

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,200
price which might be ten thousand

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,570
dollars might be a little oversold but

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,570
for ten thousand dollars you can buy

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,910
eight Dell latitudes by docking stations

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,250
for all of them and buy a second monitor

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,100
so you can do dual screen for all of

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:55,450
them and just install Linux distribution

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,850
and for a small company that's much much

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,860
more efficient use of the money when but

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:06,769
that level of finances actually matters

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,829
so also and and that leads somewhat

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:12,410
a stepping stone into dealing with those

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,879
people who dislike Linux they're not

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,730
scared of it it's not because they don't

00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:19,550
think oh I don't know what I'm doing I'm

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:23,629
gonna screw something up it's because

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,369
they they either had maybe somebody from

00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:28,040
the community I think we've all been

00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:29,839
online I've seen one of those what I

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,660
would refer to as toxic forums where

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,619
somebody asks you a question they're new

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,749
they don't they don't wanted to be told

00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:40,970
to go read the manual there and somebody

00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:42,860
just might say the wrong thing and that

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,799
can really alien a tap ursin and just

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,799
identify everything Linux as toxic and

00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:54,709
or maybe even they picked that wrong

00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:58,279
distribution that was just on that one

00:11:54,709 --> 00:12:00,739
bad version for example when I was doing

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:04,819
my Master's on medieval literature I had

00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:09,110
fedora 24 and by the time I was finished

00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:11,929
25 25 was amazingly stable upgraded to

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,990
26 eventually and I think the most

00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:20,059
stable version after that was 29 anyways

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:22,069
I was I was really new to Linux at that

00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:24,860
point my dad who's sitting in the

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:26,629
audience was so kind enough to help me

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,329
along with as much of it as I could but

00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:32,149
when I go back to college I'm on my own

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,980
so everybody I talked to you if that

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,649
used the Linux was telling me use a

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,920
bunch and use a bun too and I'm like

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:43,490
okay well I'll try a bunch of so I get a

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,899
virtual machine install it and I'm sure

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,730
there's a bunch of users in the audience

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:49,449
and I'm sure it works really really well

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,480
for you guys does anybody use a bun -

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:56,929
okay yeah and I used it a couple months

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,610
ago to do I think I got a nexus 4 and

00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:02,989
installed a bun to touch and I had to

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:05,089
use a buncha to do that but when I

00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:07,299
installed the bunt Ubuntu a few years

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,759
ago when it was still on unity it I

00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:11,899
couldn't even find the calculator and

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,850
that might have just been my computer

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:20,420
illiteracy it took me a while to find

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:24,320
LibreOffice writer and it just seemed

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:28,070
me that it was not where the most

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,990
popular at the time Linux desktop should

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,950
really be and it could have even been

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,560
because I was running it in a virtual

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,480
machine but the point is somebody had a

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,600
bad experience within actually

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:45,709
interacting with Linux so two

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:47,149
possibilities and the solution to this

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,310
is a little bit trickier because these

00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:54,050
people have have this mental wall that I

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,199
mentioned it's strong and their logic is

00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:01,730
not a thing within their sites when

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:04,220
addressing the issues so but we still

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:08,410
have to try right for the sake of our

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:12,560
companies for the sake of our honor and

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:16,880
2011 uh where any where any of you here

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:21,079
for 2011 southeast Linux best all right

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,600
cool well neither was I so but you can

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,670
find these videos on YouTube and one of

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,029
them was by a very famous mad dog hall

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:30,949
it's been with Linux since the start and

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:32,570
I had already planned to use pragmatic

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:34,550
linguistics to some extent in this

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,860
speech but when he said this phrase

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,019
which is the title of the slide don't be

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,470
from don't be a fanatic be pragmatic

00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,760
that was instantly sold in like this is

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:48,199
this is what I'm supposed to be doing

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,640
and talking about here so we're all

00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,899
fanatic we're all passionate about the

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,940
subject otherwise we wouldn't have come

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:57,560
to the conference festival so there is

00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,300
that fanatic side but when you let it

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,990
show in a professional environment or

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,089
somebody who's anti Linux for the reason

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:09,649
that they're they think it's a bad thing

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:13,970
then showing that enthusiasm isn't

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,860
always the best approach in another way

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,899
of phrasing this is where it's not

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,889
really I think Richard Stallman has a

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:23,209
different mentality he's just very very

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,850
passionate about free and open-source

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:30,649
and I think he uses a different phrase

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:33,620
but either way focusing on the free and

00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,110
open source Ness of Linux it's not going

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,870
to be effect

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,149
here I hate it because that was one of

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,670
the things that made me really like

00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,399
Linux if I didn't understand something

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,370
my dad knows see my dad knows assembly

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,829
he'd so hit in theory he could do some

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,899
kernel stuff but if you even if you just

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:56,220
look at the software by itself somebody

00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,620
could go and look at that for me if

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,209
whatever it's written in and tell me if

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,470
I'm if I'm worried about this program

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,420
and something that's doing behind the

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,649
scenes they can go and look at it for me

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,209
I can't program I dabble in HTML but

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:12,000
generally speaking the community as a

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:14,190
whole can be kind of the checks and

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,390
balances for this stuff

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:23,100
an example I the Microsoft C compiler

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:26,760
for Linux Microsoft released one but it

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,560
has data telemetry collection and you

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,450
can't really turn it off if you do it

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,600
turns itself back on in a month or two

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:39,209
when it updates and just not worth it

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,089
anyways but since it's open-source we

00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,070
can do all that and check all that but

00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,040
making that argument to somebody who

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,660
doesn't like Linux their hatred for

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,230
Linux is based on something other than

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,470
the fact

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,490
oh we can read the code that was in the

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,920
1990s

00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:01,829
that arguments over so now we've got to

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,709
move on to performance I would say and I

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:07,049
think we can all or not all but some of

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,790
us would agree that Linux is a lot more

00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:10,949
flexible we can do more we have more

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,020
choices we have infinitely more

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,370
distributions if you don't have a

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,280
distribution you like you can create

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,959
your own so there's infinite

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,480
possibilities to what you can do with it

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,949
essentially but they're not going to

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,260
look at it that way there's going to

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,400
assume oh I just have one OS and that

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:34,890
means this is better sometimes

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,410
modularity is a good thing

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,010
moving on to them the linguistic part of

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,870
this talk though I have a book in my

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,160
backpack but I'm not going to move out

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,650
of the camera site to get it

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,090
it's called principles of pragmatics so

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,270
very academic

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:55,470
mystic textbook written in the 1980s I

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:58,140
think 1983 and essentially it added to

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,409
this concept of being cooperative in

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:05,190
conversation and how to effectively

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:09,809
communicate and pragmatic linguistics is

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,850
essentially the study of language use in

00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:17,460
actual settings like when it's actually

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:20,279
being used there's four principles to

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,230
the co-operative principle and there's

00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,840
four principles to the politeness

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,350
principle if I were to put those very

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,289
academic descriptions up here and

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:33,990
explain them it my talk would be over

00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:37,590
but and I want to give a little bit more

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,169
insight and kind of help you guys get

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,899
the gist so I summarized them into three

00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:45,179
bullet points these best I can when

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:46,590
you're being cooperative when you want

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,169
to be cooperative in a conversation

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,419
about Linux with somebody who doesn't

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:54,029
like it you want to make sure you're

00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:56,220
both sides are willing to discuss the

00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:58,440
guy might be very close mine and or the

00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,730
girl whoever you're talking to they

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,710
might be close minded and they might

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,390
just be like I'm not changing my mind

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,039
here but if they're just going to talk

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:11,399
talk to them see what you can find out

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,590
both sides have to take it seriously my

00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,809
summary of this is essentially you can't

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,840
talk to trolls there's just no reasoning

00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:21,919
with them they're they're sent literally

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,919
just to make your life harder

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,409
summarizing the co-operative principle

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,630
though I think the most important thing

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:30,029
out of it is to allow that other

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,890
individual to make them think they have

00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:36,870
the authority in the conversation and

00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:38,760
they're giving you information so let's

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:43,470
say this guy comes up and says wow

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,360
you're using Linux you suck and then you

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,890
turn around in your office chair

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,669
hopefully it's a wheelie chair so you

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:53,460
can do little spins but you turn around

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:55,200
and look them dead in the eye or not if

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,620
they don't like eye contact or you don't

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,150
like eye to contact and you just ask

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:06,580
them what why doesn't mix up

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:10,020
and some of us I know when Windows 8 hit

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,240
we we decided this Windows 8 stuff

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,250
slowing slowing us down whatever that's

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,800
when a lot of us made the jump to Linux

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,200
and you can use that background if you

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,030
have it or if you don't just lie and be

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,810
like oh yeah I used to use Linux no I

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,000
didn't you can you say we're Windows you

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:31,270
used to use Windows when even if you

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,490
didn't and it worked well and then Linux

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,810
worked better for me maybe Windows is

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,240
better now which we all know it's

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:39,100
probably not at least not from the free

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,570
and open-source side which is what a lot

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:45,070
of us care about but try and get them to

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:49,030
talk about what they like about Windows

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:51,040
and like and be interested in it like oh

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,620
wow that's really cool that Windows does

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,110
that I don't think Linux used to do that

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,810
but I think it might now and you're

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,490
starting a dialogue there and they if

00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,770
you ask them to show you like you've

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,320
lived if you say Windows didn't do that

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,900
when I used it let me see it do it now

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,210
he comes and shows you on his laptop and

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,760
you're just like oh wow but I had to use

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,080
this workaround for that on Linux you're

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,590
creating a dialogue and you're showing

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,090
them how Linux works and they don't they

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,640
may not care at the moment but they're

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,700
going to remember that you're not being

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,020
a jerk to them you're communicating

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,400
enthusiastically you're talking about

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,380
them you're letting them talk about

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,520
themselves and then you're like oh cool

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:39,160
that's this is my alternative and at

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,600
worst case you make a friend so I think

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,250
I explained a little bit of the

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,360
politeness principle there maybe not

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,680
okay so when it comes to politeness

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,230
first thing don't take criticism

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,170
personally when they come up and tell

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:56,710
you your distribution sucks or Linux and

00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:59,830
general sucks they say why why are you

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,210
doing this to the company just use

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,500
Windows like the rest of the workflow

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,500
please and

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,740
you just you just don't want to you know

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,540
you know that you have the ability to do

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:18,850
more than they do on Linux more

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:20,350
flexibility but taking not taking an eye

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:25,420
for an eye I'm sure everyone's heard

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:27,340
that phrase before yes hopefully they

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,140
insult you insulting them back isn't

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,880
gonna do anything if anything is just

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:35,770
gonna push them off more so don't don't

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,080
instigate the situation further even

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,420
though they're the instigator just let

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,460
them have their moment you're you're you

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,550
know when you're in the situation you're

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,760
in control you're the smart person here

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:51,160
let just let them get their venting out

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,340
and next thing is like I said before

00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:58,930
during my explanation of the pro tip I

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,420
said I guess I called it give credit

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,670
where credit's due

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:08,890
sometimes I know it's very proprietary

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:13,060
and very irritating to you to have to

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:16,390
create accounts but sometimes Windows

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,430
does do things better right now they

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,690
have more people working on projects

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,780
they have more money to throw at

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,880
projects and as irritating as that is

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,710
it's going to give results that

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,500
sometimes come out a little better not

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,210
for the majority of the time I think I

00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,450
think there's usually a sufficient

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:42,310
enough use for Linux or a solution in

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:46,480
Linux but to fight to fight them on oh I

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,400
have this alternative is it's not making

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,650
the community better in the sense that

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,800
you're opening a new person up to Linux

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:56,950
you're saying you're still keeping your

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,330
wall up and saying hey I have this way

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,720
and it's working for me so I don't want

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,910
to hear about your way Windows does

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,920
something well give it to him like wow

00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,740
that's really cool I wish Linux did that

00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,700
or I wish fedora bun to whatever you're

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,020
using did that and maybe even explain to

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,330
them if they if they if they're

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,910
developer he'd be like maybe if you know

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,860
anything about how this app or software

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:24,640
works maybe you could help

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,799
to Linux and say maybe write some of the

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,929
code and help start a project that would

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,590
implement that feature a pin into Linux

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:35,370
be really it would make them feel good

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:38,260
like hey I could have a purpose here or

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:44,080
I'm in a minute at minimum it would

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:46,390
stroke there you go and I again it's not

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,890
oh he's fun to do that but when

00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,360
someone's ego stroked and they're like

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,610
oh yeah I'm the smart person in this

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,559
conversation they let their guard down a

00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,690
little because they they think they had

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,040
that one up on you when in reality

00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:01,720
you're just working behind the scenes

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,910
and kind of working them so give credit

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,570
where credit's due or sometimes even

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,980
when it's not due but if they're not

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,760
going to get what you're talking about

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,360
just let them have the credit for then

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,220
this is a lovely picture of sheriff Andy

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,340
Taylor from The Andy Griffith Show I'm

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:25,530
sure some of you have seen this before

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:27,549
1960s one of my favorite shows

00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:31,090
admittedly I haven't watched it in a

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:34,030
while but if you know a sheriff Andy

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,190
Taylor he does a lot of really sneaky

00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,919
things he comes off as a pretty

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,470
laid-back guy just wanting to keep the

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,410
peace and Mayberry North Carolina

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,030
actually hey I'm from Atlanta so it's

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,890
cool that I'm talking about this in the

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,500
state that it's actually happening in so

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,960
or this show fictionally took place but

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,090
anyways I'm what sheriff Andy Taylor

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,500
does when he sees something going down

00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,840
in his family like with his son Opie or

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,210
aunt bee when you see something that is

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,890
wrong he doesn't like he doesn't go up

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,370
and tell him hey I don't think that's a

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,460
good idea

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,870
stop doing that that's bad on the

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,850
sheriff I will arrest you if you do not

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,910
stop selling fruit on the side of the

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:18,820
street where shops are down on the next

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:21,760
Road that's just the most recent episode

00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,580
I've seen but anyways instead of doing

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,850
that he pitches questions here and there

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:31,120
like questions that'll help the

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,559
individual that he's talking to come to

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,790
that conclusion that what they're doing

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,460
is wrong on their own

00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:40,000
and I'm not saying that Windows is wrong

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:42,390
per se I'm just saying like plugging

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,190
that's plotted plugging Linux into this

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:49,720
hypothetical Andy Taylor situation or

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,700
Andy Griffith situation if you ask the

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,840
right questions over time and the

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,540
questions are going to be different

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,060
based on the project or app or whatever

00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,870
you're talking about with your team you

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,860
an individual whatever it is the

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,890
questions are going to be different

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,780
every time but asking the right

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,670
questions to help them get to the point

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,260
where they realize there's a problem

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,560
with using Windows in this given

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,920
situation Windows won't be this what

00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,050
we're using today might on Windows 10

00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,870
six months down the road when our

00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:26,610
business version of Windows is forced to

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,610
be updated something could change

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,760
something could change and it won't and

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,230
our app won't work anymore on the

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,590
hardware we just provided them our

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,350
clients with thinking thinking about it

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:41,110
like that and it doesn't have to be that

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,910
specific example you know your projects

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:46,270
and your work environment better than I

00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:48,430
do but getting them to come to the

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,620
problem on their own instead of just

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:55,450
upright telling them hey this is the

00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,490
problem we need to fix it let's use some

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,790
things to do that help them realize the

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,900
problem on their own and half the time

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,420
this is going to send them into some

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,790
kind of like frantic oh crap what do we

00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,550
do other half the time they will just be

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:14,110
like oh maybe maybe we need to explore

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:15,970
other options and this could lead to it

00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:22,570
might not be them installing it on their

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:27,250
computer but looking to the going back

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:28,830
to a few slides back except that these

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,820
people aren't hopping onto Linux

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:34,570
enthusiastically they're doing it for a

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,160
work project it's not about free and

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:39,310
open source software for them it's about

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,740
getting paid so if though if those

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,920
people are willing to download

00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,149
virtualbox download I guess genome boxes

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,580
well run on Windows so

00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:51,289
but downloading VirtualBox that's

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:54,820
basically universally known as the best

00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:59,590
virtual machine and installing fedora

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:03,220
fedora whatever distribution that the

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:09,799
department as a whole agrees to use

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:12,440
that's a step in the right direction so

00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:15,830
looking to the bottom point baby steps

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,769
are progress even if person still

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,419
doesn't like Linux they'll walk into the

00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:23,299
office every day and be like I hate my

00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:30,740
life I'm using Linux they're using Linux

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:33,679
so you won and in that battle so they

00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,409
may not acknowledge it and also if they

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,909
do start using Linux that's awesome you

00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:39,830
may not get the credit for bringing them

00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:44,289
over and everybody likes to be

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:48,529
well-known I say this somewhat

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:50,240
hesitantly and I love listening to

00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:52,669
podcast I love listening to YouTube

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,559
channels all that stuff but if you want

00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:57,759
credit for helping the Lexx community

00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,980
start a podcast start a YouTube channel

00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,389
start some kind of talk show you'll get

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,960
credit you'll help the Linux community

00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:08,149
that way and it's really fun I love

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,490
listening to that stuff everybody I'm

00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:14,169
sure likes likes it a little bit whether

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:17,360
your developer master of the C language

00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:18,769
what bu if you don't even know that much

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,519
about Linux at all and you're just

00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:24,200
interested that YouTube I can't tell you

00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,080
how much I've learnt about Linux off of

00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:31,220
youtube it's amazing

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,019
but mentioning but on this topic it

00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,539
can't always about it can't always be

00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:38,119
about getting credit sometimes we have

00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:40,009
to sacrifice you getting that golden

00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,659
star or me getting that golden star

00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:46,220
whoever hoped that person get onto Linux

00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:49,490
we have to sacrifice that thank you that

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:53,269
we want subconsciously maybe even but

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:56,539
gotta sacrifice that to sometimes

00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:58,129
improve the community and with all of us

00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:01,130
being here being passionate about it I

00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:08,880
think it's a very small price to pay

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:12,000
and I hope no youtubers or podcasters or

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,890
show's Hawk people journalists take that

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,330
the wrong way my point there's mainly

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,410
that there's certain battles that are

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:24,090
won publicly on those type of venues and

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,810
then there's others that are better

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:31,790
place through just one-on-one just being

00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:37,650
kind to a person and being open to them

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:40,110
so and re-emphasizing when's the right

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:43,950
time when's the right place don't go

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:47,670
into your meeting of colleagues thinking

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:50,040
oh crap we have this project due in a

00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,750
week what are we going to do thinking

00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:56,750
hey I'm gonna walk in and sell them

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:58,740
Linux because even if you succeed there

00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,510
half of them are going to resent you for

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,000
it

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:06,390
it might it might win the battle might

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,970
solve the problem for the project but

00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,830
the amount of stress that it caused them

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,270
for that week and a half were they were

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:16,050
scrambling to get a virtual machine

00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:19,650
going getting stuff developed stuff like

00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:23,250
that it's it internally just stresses

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,720
them out and they want to lead Linux

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,030
again as soon as possible

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,700
you don't want somebody who just

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:32,250
finished their project like that's done

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,500
I cannot get this virtual machine off my

00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:38,430
computer as soon as like I cannot get

00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,170
this office sooner then I can't remember

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:45,300
I was going to say I can't get it off

00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:49,410
soon enough yeah yeah but you don't want

00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:52,380
that mentality even if they don't like

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,880
Linux still them forgetting about it

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,460
wanting to go home and sleep for the

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,430
next day then they wake up like oh that

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,960
that VM is still here they may power it

00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,420
up again just now that they're not

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,580
stressed anymore they can experience

00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,520
that genome desktop environment KT

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:12,210
whatever distro you led the company to

00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,530
use they may power it up and just play

00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,470
around with it see what it's actually

00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:16,990
about outside

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:19,120
the project it's happened before I've

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,270
personally helped someone with it before

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,230
a Georgia State they were curious and

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:27,820
they're not using Linux right now I

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,360
think they're using a MacBook right now

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,789
yeah but they tried it they were open

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,059
and it was a step in the right direction

00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:38,950
and they don't fear it anymore they're

00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:43,000
like this is a tool that I could use if

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:50,230
I continue learning to program or just

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:52,150
want to change on my computer so yeah I

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,780
guess I guess that's all I had to say on

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,659
the matter

00:33:52,780 --> 00:34:05,650
I think there's 10 ish minutes give or

00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:07,950
take left questions comments feedback go

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,950
for it

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:20,250
you know you've won when you see your

00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,920
memes tweeted back to you without what

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:26,200
without attribution that I've heard that

00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,300
before and that is now that I think

00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,540
about it that is amazingly true and a

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:43,200
perfect perfect phrase to go along with

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:43,200
this very very cool anybody

00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:15,069
I totally I agree

00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:18,339
yeah sometimes just casually without

00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:19,869
there being a problem just occasionally

00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:22,829
bringing up hey I just did this really

00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:25,960
awesome thing come check it out and then

00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:27,940
it's interesting they may roll their

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,729
eyes oh it's on Linux who cares

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,660
it's you're happy with it you feel

00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:36,549
accomplished and that when that Linux

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,950
hater just watched Linux something

00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:42,099
happened on it so at minimum you won

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:47,710
that one that satisfaction if you're

00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:54,539
that bitter maniacal individual like I

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:54,539
am so anyone else

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,910
okay I guess I very thoroughly covered

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,910
it

00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:16,109
anything confusing or any problems you'd

00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:23,740
like to discuss as a probably 30-ish

00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:25,000
team of dedicated Linux users all right

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,810
awesome
