Whether it is is a manager who “just doesn’t understand” or a colleague gifting you with his critical wisdom of Windows 10’s superiority to your chosen Linux distribution, it is a safe assumption that a majority of Linux users have all experienced OS-based criticism at some point in life. Considering the typical mentality of the instigator, these instances can be frustrating and difficult to deal with, especially if you are the only Linux desktop user in a company of Windows and Mac users. If not handled properly, these situations can negatively affect your reputation as a cooperative and competent employee. Additionally, improper handling of these criticisms can negatively impact the reputation of the Linux/FOSS community. In this presentation, I will use several simplified principles of linguistic discourse analysis to discuss ways that Linux/FOSS users can approach these inevitable confrontations and turn them into opportunities to provide these Linux critics with a potentially new image of the FOSS community as a whole that is perhaps less intimidating or exclusive than they previously believed when making critical comments.
