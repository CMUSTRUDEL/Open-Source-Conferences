Title: Christopher Waid - Retaking The Public Forum : Decentralizing Media With Free Software
Publication date: 2019-06-19

	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
The internet has become a cesspool of censorship with platforms left and right deciding who can talk to who and about what. It seems like everybody wants a piece of the act.  From abusive copyright holders to politicians demanding censorship for the sake of the children. What’s left is a boring echo chamber of the politically correct.

As a co-host of a nationally syndicated radio show and media correspondent of the politically intolerable I have seen first hand just how bad things have gotten online. The tools of the censors have become a massively destructive mechanism to social debate.

This past year I started a freedom slanted tech show based around free software and decentralized technologies. In this talk I’ll be covering libre friendly hardware, live streaming, independently setting up video relay servers, as well as the decentralized social media tools I’ve used to promote my show.
