Title: Christopher Waid - Retaking The Public Forum : Decentralizing Media With Free Software
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
The internet has become a cesspool of censorship with platforms left and right deciding who can talk to who and about what. It seems like everybody wants a piece of the act.  From abusive copyright holders to politicians demanding censorship for the sake of the children. What’s left is a boring echo chamber of the politically correct.

As a co-host of a nationally syndicated radio show and media correspondent of the politically intolerable I have seen first hand just how bad things have gotten online. The tools of the censors have become a massively destructive mechanism to social debate.

This past year I started a freedom slanted tech show based around free software and decentralized technologies. In this talk I’ll be covering libre friendly hardware, live streaming, independently setting up video relay servers, as well as the decentralized social media tools I’ve used to promote my show.

if you have an opinion that does not

00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:09,960
necessarily agree with the that of the

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,630
platform you will know you will not be

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,289
able to speak it or you will not be able

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,449
to speak it on that platform so one of

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,949
the questions that I think people should

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,230
be asking is do we really have access to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000
a more diverse set of opinions if

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:30,480
everyone is on the same censored

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,219
platforms and so one of the things that

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,480
I do is I do a show called freedom

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,370
decrypted and basically it's it's a it's

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,760
like a it's actually a radio show

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,460
podcast video show there's it does air

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,890
on a handful of radio stations but it's

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,309
primarily online at freedom to cryptic

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,570
comm and in order to get this show now

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,760
I've done it I've done a number of years

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,230
in radio and so this is a little bit

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,589
different when I'm used to but I've

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:07,880
never had a studio for video until

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:10,049
basically like a year ago or so and I

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,490
figured out how to make this all work

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,080
with free software and learned how to

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,540
over the course of a year

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,150
get off of those centralized platforms

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,299
so the show doesn't it's not on Facebook

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,640
it's not on YouTube it's uh it's using

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:31,350
totally either decentralized or self

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,369
hosted solutions so some of the things

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,100
that I I picked up some of things I

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,600
discovered in doing this where it's

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,369
actually gets very expensive if you try

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,070
and put together a show using all the

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,320
the good stuff um there's probably about

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,729
$5,000 worth of equipment but you could

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,049
do a little for a lot less depending on

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,880
what you're trying to what your aim is

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,640
you don't necessarily have to a thousand

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,159
dollar camcorder or a 300 dollar HDMI

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,630
capture card or $50 headphones or you

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,100
know spend a thousand dollars on like

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,930
arms and things like that

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,520
that's some of the things that you know

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,659
you probably do but some of the things

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
you would probably need are like a green

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,070
screen if you're going to do

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,050
you don't really even need that

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,330
technically you get some banners or

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,270
something like that you can do and you

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,880
don't necessarily need to do like XLR is

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,490
basically like the better the better

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,470
stuff is got XLR cables for it you might

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,130
need to solder that but no that's really

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,420
necessary

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,510
the things that you probably want are

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,650
like the camera and the tripod you might

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,850
want to get some blankets cheapo

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,920
blankets that's actually how we Dyer

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,110
sound our sound almost stay for

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,990
soundproofing but um basically makes the

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,430
audio better but some of the things you

00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,200
probably do want to get our like if you

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,390
if you do if you do get a camera quarter

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,580
a good HDMI capture card because if

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,750
cheaper ones are garbage alright you're

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,910
also probably gonna want to get a mixer

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,700
of some kind you don't necessarily need

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,990
a mixer but um if you're gonna do any

00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,450
kind of audio it's it's good to have a

00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,500
good sound good quality microphone

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,910
there's a lot of microphones out there

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,740
that are they're just garbage that are

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,880
under like three hundred dollars if you

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,500
get a couple three hundred other

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,770
microphones you can do a pretty good job

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,490
of pretty professional stuff without a

00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:16,610
lot of the other stuff so one of the one

00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,350
of the ways you do a show some sort of

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,580
streaming video show is with a program

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,320
called OBS OBS studio is stands for open

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,630
broadcaster software and this is

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,760
basically the major application to do

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,530
any kind of streaming video streaming on

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,940
like you well a lot most of the time

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,110
people do it on YouTube but you don't

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,820
necessarily need YouTube for that and

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,940
I'm gonna go into that a little bit it's

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,230
per it's fairly easily installed on your

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,730
major distributions if you're in like a

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,220
demi base distribution it's just a

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,959
matter of doing sudo apt-get or some

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,300
sorry sudo add apt repository PPA : OBS

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,160
projects forward slash OBS - studio and

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,260
then apt-get update and apt-get install

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,520
oh yes - studio and then I'll actually

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,830
give you the latest version of it as

00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,950
well and I believe updates as well when

00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,620
they come out so one of the one of the

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,560
ways you get around not having to use

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,110
YouTube or Facebook to stream video is

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,239
using something called a relay server

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:15,380
and you set up your own relay server and

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:19,580
basically what this is is instead of

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,780
connecting your OBS to YouTube or

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,790
Facebook you can connect it to

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,250
this basically relay server that

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:30,720
operates out on like a co-located server

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,000
or a virtual private server and that can

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,160
actually relate to other servers like

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,570
YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,450
twitch and things like that if you

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,130
wanted to set it up that way and you you

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,420
may even if you have your own server set

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,660
up like this you may still want to do

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,340
that in order to gain I bow eyeballs

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,070
basically more of as a marketing tool as

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,930
opposed to a I'm relying on YouTube if

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,670
they decide I can't say something and

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,310
they shut me down that's it for my show

00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,710
or whatever I'm trying to do wonder that

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,780
one of the programs that I have set up

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,630
for example with our set up is called

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,400
int media server and this basically just

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,810
like I said that's this is the part that

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,580
enables you to relay but you can

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,130
actually also do the same thing with

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,630
just a stock engine ex-agents a stop

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,280
configuration but an antigen X

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,540
configuration you don't necessarily need

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,690
to do media it's more like a adds a

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,430
pretty user interface to it but it does

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,290
have certain things built into it like

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,430
Facebook YouTube and it does add a

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,990
pretty user interface to enter the all

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,190
the live streaming stuff that you would

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:39,780
you would need in order to get it

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:43,020
working alright so the main thing you

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,890
need to get started with OBS is a some

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,330
sort of video and audio stream I guess

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,430
you could do it with just an audio

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,590
stream although I don't know what

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,690
happens with the video at that point I

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,180
do more of a video show myself so it's

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,729
and then later we extract the audio from

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,710
it for like a podcast format although

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,320
you can download the video as well and

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:09,540
the show that I do is a live show so you

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,570
tune it out five five to seven on No 5

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,100
to 8 on Saturdays and it would be just

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,540
like if you went to YouTube or whatever

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,430
and and tried to access the show so it's

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,919
it's pretty easy to actually use OBS and

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,990
I've had people tell me it's hard and

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,940
I'm not quite sure why they think it's

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,680
hard to use and it may just be that it

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,000
used to be harder to use than it is

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,550
currently but these were also less

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,630
technical people but basically it's just

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,900
a matter of clicking on a little plus

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:42,340
on the screen if you look at under where

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,780
it says scenes and if you click that

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,150
little plus error you create a scene and

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,500
then in order to add audio or video you

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,240
can click the little plus R arrow under

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,160
where it says sources and what this does

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,410
is you can you can switch them between

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,500
scenes so for example you can go from in

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,790
my example I have a live scene where it

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,030
says no signal at the moment but if

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,580
there was a HDMI camera hooked up to

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,630
this at that point and all turned on it

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,530
would actually show them you can

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,570
actually see a little bit of the video

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,490
of what what's normally there it's a

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,410
little basically yeah there's a green

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,440
screen and there's a image behind it of

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,800
Keane which is the town that I run the

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,360
show out of and then there's like

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,910
usually two people standing sitting in

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,140
on the on this show and you would see

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,570
that normally under live scene but if

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,180
you click on Firefox scene it would then

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,530
show basically browser you might have

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,300
seen that if you've ever watched any

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,580
kind of like YouTube personalities or

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,160
whatever they often will switch or maybe

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,870
a game if you're into gaming watching

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,820
that kind of thing so it's fairly common

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,300
stuff it's not that hard to use really

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,800
it's mostly just a matter of switching

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,040
between scenes adding the right video

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,140
feed and that's just that's about it

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,720
okay so now the one thing that you do

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,810
have to setup is the server or the relay

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,750
server and so basically there is there's

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,780
a setting preferences and then you go to

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,030
stream you enter your server address and

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,340
this is this is the address with ant

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,480
media server that I've got set up here

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,160
select custom if you didn't select

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,600
custom you would usually select like

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,160
YouTube or Facebook or whatever I

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,470
believe and then you'd enter what's

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,400
called a key and that's just basically

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:20,800
requires authentication in order to

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,420
stream to your server so then there's

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,970
some other settings here that you'd want

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,800
to set up it's you want to adjust the

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:32,800
output so basically you know select what

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,870
format - this is actually let's see this

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,130
is actually to do the to record the

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,320
video as opposed to just do the live

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,330
streaming so if you want to actually

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,160
record the videos that are your live

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,260
streaming now that can also be done on a

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,670
media server to automatically I don't do

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,779
it that way I do it so that it's just

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,300
records automatically to the system

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,910
initiating this the initial stream and

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,529
it you know it's I mean it's kind of

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,310
self-explanatory I feel like the

00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:01,629
encoders x264 I will say that like if

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,370
you try to do like vp9 or something like

00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,160
that you might I don't even know if you

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,199
can really do that to be honest because

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,870
I'm not entirely sure that at least not

00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,759
with the version I've got that the

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,050
encoding is I think it's all done in

00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:20,230
software and the x264 is done in

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,360
hardware and I don't know it takes a

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,360
really long time to actually do the

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,949
encoding I believe there's unfortunately

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,379
at this point you can't really do it on

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,480
with vp9 but you might be able to now

00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:33,160
that like a year is passed and some of

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,839
that maybe there's more hard work and

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,120
encoding support if you would nor system

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,649
or something along those lines so yeah

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,639
then if you have a green screen there's

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,509
one other thing you're probably gonna

00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,540
want to know about and that's something

00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:51,310
called a chroma key basically it's just

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,500
telling the OBS software what your green

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,199
screen color is in order to replace that

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,899
green color with whatever picture or

00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:01,420
video it is that you want to display in

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,430
the background again this is not

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,689
something you necessarily need to do if

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,370
you just have if you don't have a green

00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:08,259
screen you know you don't really need to

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,180
do that now there's one other thing that

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:11,769
you can do to make yourself yourself

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,850
look a little bit more professional if

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:16,720
you're doing some sort of show and

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:19,059
that's to use a little presentation

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,980
clicker so they something I don't have

00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,779
here I could have brought but um then

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,069
you wouldn't necessarily see me clicking

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:25,029
on my laptop you just be pressing a

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:29,379
button and it would look a lot more

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,240
professional so that's something that's

00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,800
nice to have and basically the way you

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,860
do that is you just it's called the

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,829
hotkey and you can select the hotkey so

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,639
when I initially start the show I press

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:45,910
one of those clicker keys and that will

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,009
basically tell it to go to my intro

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,240
screen which plays a little video that

00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:53,769
says something what it says it says

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,410
freedom decrypted is sponsored by think

00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,630
penguin and liberty mind it I believe is

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,730
what it says and then the next scene is

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,920
the live scene and

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,250
that I just click a different button and

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:10,089
it goes to the live video feed so it's

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,610
fairly easy to do and then to actually

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,899
start streaming you basically hit start

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,279
streaming button on your computer if you

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,510
have a clicker again just program the

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,250
hotkey and you don't even have to do

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,769
anything more than that so this is a

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,079
little basically you don't see this

00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,310
normally in the video of an actual show

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,050
but this is kind of the background this

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,550
is my studio that I have set up I've got

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,630
a little monitor here so I can actually

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,540
read from the screen so you're looking

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,100
at the camera basically now you can get

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,480
a lot fancier if you get I'm trying to

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,949
think what it's called but um there's

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,389
like fancier setups that you think you

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,800
know professionals use like a TV studio

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:40,810
you can get something like that

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
apparently you can do them kind of cheap

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,240
but I found just a monitor I had laying

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,040
around works just fine and then the

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,500
camera is actually above the monitor so

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,089
it's Sutan down and you can see the

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,550
green screen and we got a couple banners

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,990
for events promotion at events you get

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,060
the lighting you got the little

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,850
microphones there so this is actually a

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,230
pretty nice setup here we got and then

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,699
there's actually another camera if you

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,800
see it right there a smaller one and

00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,769
that's actually new to montage setup and

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,709
basically it's got it just basically

00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,420
shows the studio before the show

00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,920
actually starts so in the beginning in

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,529
the end I think that's kind of just a

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,089
neat little it's a little it's just a

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,279
little neat thing that's nice and then

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,230
on the left here or let's see yeah on

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,540
the left there

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,579
you've got a little mixer that we've got

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:34,079
set up yeah so as I was saying before

00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:37,990
there is you can actually use just cheap

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:41,139
Home Depot moving blankets in order to

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,720
improve the sound quality of your of

00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:44,949
your audio and it's it's really I don't

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,690
know exactly what though cost but I

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,540
think maybe like 16 dollars a blanket I

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,699
think we got like eight blankets you may

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,319
not need that but um if you're if you're

00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:55,510
really trying to up in a bit it's

00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:56,889
certainly nice thing to have I mean it's

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:03,430
literally just a matter of hanging them

00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:05,700
on your walls so now one of the things I

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,330
want to talk to you about is

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,790
about where we're Ustream - and you

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,310
could stream you set up that media

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,030
server and we're some sort of nginx

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,090
relay server and what you can do is you

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,070
can either just a link to that directly

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:28,740
but what I actually did is I actually

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:30,870
linked to a how do I say this there's

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,400
something called float player and that's

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,960
actually integrated into the website so

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,350
it's just basically the playback

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,370
playback software for WebM or whatever

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,330
the stream is actually it's not where

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,830
them is x264 or whatever but basically

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,290
it's really not that hard there's

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,120
there's all sorts of different software

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,310
you could do one of the ones that's more

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,900
common is WordPress you set up a

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,730
wordpress blog and that's basically what

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,160
we did here is we just got a basically

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,550
stopped WordPress blog and we link to

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,420
different listening options and and then

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,780
we do some other stuff with

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,210
notifications but okay so in a minute so

00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,130
yeah and then now the the flow player

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,860
I'm not a big fan of flow player to be

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,100
honest so it's GPL 3 licensed but it

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,920
doesn't they have this little terms of

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,970
in the GPL 3 that allows for additional

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,260
conditions on those those terms and it's

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:28,470
its relation to the name of the software

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,900
and it's being abused so they're

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,750
basically saying if you want to use this

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,430
in production commercially you have to

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,160
license their software which isn't

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,680
really the case of the GPL version 3 but

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,350
because those terms that it allows to be

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,570
added additional terms they're

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,070
presenting it that way you can modify

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,210
the software if you want and I actually

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,580
went to hacked on that that's a little

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,860
bit more work but basically what happens

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,200
is on the video itself they basically

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,900
are saying you have to show the flow

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,970
media logo and if this big flow media

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,440
logo is actually in every single one of

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,770
your videos it obstructs the video and

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,030
it totally makes the software useless so

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,410
what I did was I just made a

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,540
modification to it a slight modification

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:13,200
to it and shrunk the size of the logo

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,360
and I turned it into a gif basically so

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,800
now it goes away after a few seconds and

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,690
I've technically complied with the terms

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,430
of the licensing and I haven't paid

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,319
their commercial ace

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,329
nonsense and I don't necessarily have an

00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:25,350
issue with contributing to and I

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,259
definitely encourage people to

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,689
contribute to free software projects but

00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,149
when a company goes out of the way to

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:34,769
basically manipulate people like this I

00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:37,850
totally advocate for people not

00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:42,059
complying or complying but not actually

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,499
giving them their the money so none of

00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,129
this was actually decentralized this was

00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:50,300
also self hosted but there is a way to

00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,499
decentralized and distributed

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,360
distribution of your video so there's

00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:57,779
something called library it's sort of

00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,449
similar to BitTorrent ipfs and YouTube

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:04,040
all in one it basically it combines all

00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:07,079
of those and unlike these other options

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,079
library besides being decentralized

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:13,259
distributed it also it doesn't do live

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,839
video but it does make it so that you

00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,720
can discover video like YouTube and it

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,209
also has amounted monetization mechanism

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,949
built right into it through basically a

00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,569
cryptocurrency they called library

00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:27,209
credits and they're they're relatively

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:30,209
easy to get and the benefit of this is

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:32,699
you can contribute to basically any

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:36,120
videos the producers of any videos that

00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,559
you might want to do that you can you

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,879
can do that with a credit card and and

00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,309
this is basically as you can see on the

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,829
screen this is actually we have we

00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,689
actually don't have our show videos yet

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:46,740
on libraries I'm still working on

00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:50,160
getting that set up so it submits it

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,439
automatically but what you can actually

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,209
do something called YouTube connect I

00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:56,579
think it's called and basically it will

00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,829
allow you to automatically sync between

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,089
YouTube and libraries so if you are

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,279
publishing to YouTube

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,959
it would also automatically publish to

00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,909
library as well if you wanted to set

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,949
that up and that's how these videos

00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:09,689
basically got on on our freedom to

00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,370
cryptid stream speaker just basically

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,980
there were a few videos that we uploaded

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,990
previously to YouTube that we're not

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,510
specifically show videos but some of

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,270
these videos clips basically were

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,720
presented in the freedom decrypted show

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,669
it's I do like to show like demos and

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,199
various demos is not hopefully too long

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:31,980
because it's mostly a talk show that I

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,150
do but certain things like see geol if

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,390
anybody's familiar with that

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,610
it's a doom it's a continuation of doom

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,430
basically and like the original classic

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,350
doom and so I did a short video of that

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,970
demoing that and it's one of the few

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,350
games that there's a police source code

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,640
on it for for Linux and free software

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,180
operating systems so you can actually

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,320
natively play this doom but you can also

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,790
play this new version of doom created by

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,010
some of the original developers it's not

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,870
I don't think it's official it's

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,220
official but it's it's the same

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,540
developer basically or one of the

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,940
developers who create the original doom

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,290
and a bunch of other popular titles so I

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,970
thought that was kind of cool and that's

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:14,160
that you can and you can actually link

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:16,440
to you can link to library basically

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,590
through the open web without actually

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,850
having library installed too and that is

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:27,360
basically through speech that's SP e dot

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,850
CH and so we actually do that so as you

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,860
can see here there's it's just if you

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:36,510
actually enter the address HTTP colon

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:39,330
for such flow slash SP e CH /at freedom

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,880
decrypted and you hit enter you will

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,860
actually see what you would be able to

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,860
access through the library

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,870
it's obviously not decentralized in that

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,750
sense so that could be censored but if

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,730
you open up library directly and access

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,040
at freedom decrypted bees that's the

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,020
that's basically the the library channel

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,310
it's kind of like a YouTube channel that

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,600
can't be censored so that's really cool

00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,740
getting library credits like I said it's

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,540
actually fairly easy you know I actually

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,940
I feel like I have purchased library

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,860
credits before but um I'm not entirely

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,060
sure that I did so library credits are

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,830
actually pretty easy to get because you

00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,840
can when you install the app you

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,280
actually like get credits I think just

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,990
for installing the app in and of itself

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,820
but there's also like other things you

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,500
could do to get credits like besides

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,650
mining too so it's not even like hard to

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,020
get credits but you can also buy credits

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,520
easily through I have used change Li

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,960
before which is why I'm mentioning it

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,940
change Li makes it really easy to

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,310
basically convert crypto currencies one

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,600
crypto currency from one crypto currency

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:42,300
to a nother crypto currency but I've

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,650
never actually used it to buy crypto

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,920
currencies it's with a credit card but

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,330
apparently you can do that so

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,500
that's one way to to get

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,600
cryptocurrencies and it doesn't

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,540
necessarily require you to go to a

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,390
vending machine or I don't know buy them

00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,440
off your friends or whatever so it's

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,630
it's kind of cool

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,770
now I wanted to talk a little bit about

00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,030
marketing the show or your channel or

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,070
whatever whatever it is you're trying to

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,890
do exactly and one of the ways to do

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,400
that is through master Don it's Macedon

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,200
is a decentralized social networking

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,120
platform I guess you could call it

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,090
except that it's because it's federated

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,530
you have a you have thousands of servers

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,570
set up and you can either set up your

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,120
own server which I will have to say is

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,090
not something that's easy to do and it's

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,590
kind of like the directions I apparently

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,330
are not that good I haven't done it

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,410
myself but um somebody else I'm working

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,880
with set up set up a server for us and

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,290
he was like he's just pulling his hair

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,260
out trying he knows what he's doing he's

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,420
a system admin and it just it I guess

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,820
the software it's based off of is not

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,470
that great or dependent on some of the

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,790
dependencies and so it's just it's a

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,220
it's a hair rolling thing but

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,540
fortunately there are a lot of servers

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,830
already out there set up so you can

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,530
actually just join any one of them and

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,870
if one you know one server is run by a

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,430
socialist in your libertarian well you

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,900
know don't join the social is the server

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,700
because if they want to block you they

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,460
could but you can join another server

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,810
for libertarians and magically the

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:14,520
problem goes away and you can do that

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:17,220
vice versa obviously so I didn't want to

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,040
be in that situation of you know being

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,020
blocked or kicked off of a particular

00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,330
node so that's why we set up our own

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,070
server not that I think that we have I

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,540
have that much to say that's gonna be

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,540
likely to get us blocked from you to or

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,430
you know any other platform anyway but

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,320
should that should somebody not like

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,790
something I say like I don't know

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,110
YouTube is horrible for example like you

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:43,230
do doesn't like that

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:46,350
well doesn't really matter so all right

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,420
so this is no like I said mastodons kind

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,500
of like Twitter but again not

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,180
centralized so there's nobody you can

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:56,970
kick you off this is on the on the right

00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,870
here you can see this is a little trying

00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,870
to think this is this is

00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:06,929
this is fatty lab I believe and fatty

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:13,169
lab is basically a application for

00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:14,580
Android in they can get from F to F

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,750
trade store which is for those who

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,019
aren't familiar with EFT right it's

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,549
basically uh I think it's called Google

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,710
I think I think Android clays calls

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,299
their App Store Google Play and it's

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,880
basically a Google Play alternative that

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,179
only has free software so that's kind of

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,169
cool

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,360
and basically it allows you to post your

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:37,740
Twitter like toots they call up toots on

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:42,269
on Mastodon and so I - whenever I show

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:44,190
is about to go live or a show has been

00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,870
concluded and we post the video it

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:47,909
actually set up there's also something

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,740
called things called auto toot and

00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,600
basically that will integrate it's a

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,360
plug-in that integrates with WordPress

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,740
and so it'll automatically whatever I

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,019
posted to the blog will automatically

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:03,120
get posted to Mastodon and you don't

00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:06,000
have to be on the same Mastodon instance

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:14,309
as somebody else in order for them to

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:15,990
get your toot so yeah that's gonna go so

00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:21,289
another thing that's kind of cool is you

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,289
can actually embed using an iframe your

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,880
your toots I guess if that's how you

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:32,880
want to phrase it I on your site so um

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,470
it's not too hard to do and it's kind of

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,750
cool so people will see like what your

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,139
Tooting even if they're not on Mastodon

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,059
yet

00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:43,830
we actually linked to a mastodon server

00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,769
not the one that we've got set up but

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,450
another one somebody else's Mastodon

00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:49,620
instance and so you can actually sign up

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,139
or write on the site so if you've never

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,549
actually used Mastodon it's not that

00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,899
really it's not really that hard to join

00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:56,549
a Macedonian since it's no different

00:23:54,899 --> 00:24:04,139
than joining Twitter or some other you

00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:05,850
know proprietary platform see so now

00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:07,620
there's there's also other ways to

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,049
market and these are probably ways to

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,179
market like a show you've probably never

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,949
really you probably wouldn't think of

00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,690
email is actually still one of the

00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:18,929
biggest players in terms of it's

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,659
something everybody has so marketing

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:25,079
people are gonna be like duh you know

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:28,709
use email but it's not something that I

00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:31,529
think your your typical youtuber would

00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:33,089
think of and it's something that I

00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:37,529
thought of because I'm like well how can

00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:40,049
i market a show that you know is I don't

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:41,399
want youtube if I'm not on Facebook and

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:43,889
by the way Facebook is terrible for

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:50,099
marketing um you know how do I go about

00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:51,419
doing it so well email you can set up

00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:53,789
your own email server and I know a lot

00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,799
of people are kind of like oh but it's

00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:58,859
so hard and spam and all this other

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,899
stuff and I want to say it can be a

00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:02,549
little challenging but at the same time

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,619
there's actually scripts nowadays that

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,190
make it really pretty simple if you

00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,369
haven't used

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:10,440
I read mail or mail in a box I would

00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:13,259
check it out basically both of these

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,149
projects make it almost idiot proof to

00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,669
setup it's it's really not that hard you

00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:19,979
can find tutorials online that will

00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:22,979
basically you know spin up a windowed

00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:24,389
instance or on some other VPS you know

00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,819
whatever your favorite VPS provider is

00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,959
and we run the script and it will

00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:30,479
basically ask you for everything you

00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:32,489
need to know it'll set it up there might

00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:34,529
be a few things DNS wise that you need

00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:37,019
to do to I think the directions usually

00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:39,299
will give if you have decent size

00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,409
directions anyway you know actually and

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,759
if anybody has any questions actually

00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:44,429
about this you can always email me Kris

00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,779
at freedom to cryptic calm but I can

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,169
email you it can't let you know what the

00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,669
good directions are that actually work

00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:53,099
but it'll explain how to set up the DNS

00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,440
and let me continue

00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:58,319
so the DNS stuff is actually the tricky

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,389
part I think and in order to comply with

00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,379
spam and like so the Gmail actually

00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:02,819
accepts your emails and you don't get

00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:04,969
blacklisted and stuff there's certain

00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,679
things you want to do with the DNS and

00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:09,509
there's a tool there's there's probably

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,989
more than one but one that I've used

00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,109
recently

00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:14,669
now I already have mail servers for

00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:16,559
think penguin comm which is another

00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:17,909
company that this company I'm the CEO of

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,169
that company and founder and basically

00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,629
sell computers and accessories and

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,239
things like that for Linux and free

00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:25,440
softie yeah somebody in the audience

00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:29,009
just held the

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,110
our laptops but we have a mail server

00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,940
set up for that and I've never used any

00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,649
kind of test program to see how you know

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,360
where do we fall on the spam ranking

00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:39,179
basically like how friendlies are now

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,309
our mail servers for them were I think

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,860
there were six out of ten and they never

00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:46,220
had I've never encountered anybody who

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:50,879
hasn't gotten our mail but nonetheless

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:53,940
when I set up a mail server for freedom

00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:56,909
decrypted explicitly because I wanted to

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,350
set up a newsletter software as well I

00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:00,509
want to make sure that our emails

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,549
actually got to got to the people who

00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:05,759
they were intended to get to so I used a

00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:08,879
little web service called mail - tester

00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,470
comm and it worked great and it

00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:13,169
basically helped me narrow down like the

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,009
little things that would be potentially

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:18,929
an issue maybe with some email providers

00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:21,299
when it comes to spam and you know

00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:24,690
blocking blocking your newsletters or

00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:27,990
your emails from getting through so

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,659
basically now when you know we send out

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,809
an email it passes right through Google

00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:39,029
and other providers anti-spam systems so

00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:40,590
one of the things one of the things that

00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,860
you also probably gonna want to do is

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,120
set up something called a mail train

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,210
basically if anybody's ever done an

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,980
email marketing before a lot of

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,110
different entities and organizations use

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,419
something called MailChimp and so mail

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:59,669
train is basically the equivalent of Mel

00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:03,200
chimp but without the centralization so

00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:05,309
you can actually you can use services

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,259
like I'm trying to think some of them

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,960
that exist but there's like basically

00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:12,000
services that offer a mail server so

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,039
that your mails don't get blocked but we

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,679
already set that up in the prior

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,480
presumably in the prior screen here so

00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,279
we can actually just use that and what

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,860
happens is in MailChimp in the software

00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,799
in this newsletter software you can

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,110
actually just enter your SMTP server

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,840
information username and password and it

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:33,570
will just use that and it actually works

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:37,919
great as you can see we've got mailing

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,640
lists for a bunch of different projects

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,570
and things that I work

00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,040
fork fest stop party is another I want

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,430
to say a conference it's not so much a

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,970
conference but a it's a camping festival

00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:54,460
so and it's a it's a decentralized

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,650
camping festival actually um so there's

00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,970
nobody actually in charge of it and it's

00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,320
kind of cool if you if you haven't

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,130
checked it out check it out but

00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,040
basically a lot of tech people have kind

00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:08,380
of gotten together and organized it and

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,060
sort of not really B's there's nobody

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,620
actually in charge but much people get

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,700
together and it's cots there's the the

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,980
mailing list is brand new so it's only

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,960
got 7 people subscribed as well as of

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,790
that but there's hundreds of people who

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,610
are on like telegram and some other

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,020
platforms that are being used to

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,540
organize it and actually it's kind of

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,980
cool because we actually moved away from

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,680
Google Calendar in past years and now

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:38,200
we're on to I think we're using we're

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,350
using I'm going blank here but it's it's

00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,390
the popular next cloud next cloud for

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,500
our calendaring on that as well so it's

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,180
like there's all these different tools

00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,300
you can use if you're organizing events

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:57,520
or you know shows or whatever to help

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:59,170
market your show so so yeah so freedom

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,120
decrypted like I said is it's just our

00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,360
freedom slanted weekly text show that I

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,340
do for perkily people um we're a talk

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,350
show that covers the latest tech it's

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,210
just W decentralized systems copyright

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,950
freedom a good new Linux

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:17,370
cryptocurrencies and more check it out

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:17,370
it's freedom to crypto comm questions

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,970
one of the things that this is a very

00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:29,860
interesting subject to me decentralized

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,470
everything on the internet one of the

00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,240
things as I talk about this with people

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,390
outside of the sphere of technology is

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,010
well how can I do this myself they don't

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:43,590
really have an appetite to set up a

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:47,370
server a centralized service like some

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:51,640
stuff that is decentralized like the

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,380
library project how would like a

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,180
non-technical user get

00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,180
indoctrinated into something like that

00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:06,570
so library is very easy to install it's

00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,600
you don't need to set up a server it's

00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:12,070
based off of like a block I think it's

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,770
based off like a blockchain technology

00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:18,070
so basically once you've uploaded the

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:21,490
video to library even if you shut down

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,920
your instance it's still your videos are

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,840
still readily available so that's

00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,560
actually the easiest possible thing to

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,750
use I've I wouldn't have a problem as a

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,630
non-technical user using it it's

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,250
literally just a matter of selecting an

00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,630
upload button once library is installed

00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,280
and it doesn't matter whether you're on

00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:49,000
Linux or Windows or some other operating

00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:52,060
system it's so so so so simple I guess

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,460
the other concern is users installing a

00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:58,000
client who want a view they can use the

00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,280
website just as effectively yes so

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,630
that's correct it's literally just a

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,550
matter of going to SP e dot CH so speech

00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,670
and then forward slash and then at your

00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,020
channel so like I said before our

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,900
channel for freedom decrypted is

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,220
literally freedom decrypted it is cap

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,820
sensitive so I think you do have to have

00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,800
an F and a and a D there and freedom to

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,840
corrupt it but other than that yeah and

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,070
we do just link to it from my website we

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,800
do have a direct link and then we have a

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,640
indirect link so if you're no if you

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,350
don't have the library application

00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:35,830
installed yeah now keep in mind that

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,720
because it is speech is a domain name

00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:40,240
and they potentially would have to

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,810
censor you probably if I don't know

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,740
you're really doing something that was

00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:49,960
out there in terms of in terms of

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,210
contents possibly um I don't know in

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,890
terms of like domain registers like what

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,530
might be a problem but there certainly

00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:58,330
could be there's certainly instances

00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,530
that might be an issue or maybe even not

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,030
so much out there but like if you're

00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,140
doing I don't know like if you're doing

00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,000
some sort of show that's promoting

00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,110
piracy or something like that that might

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
be probably a good example of something

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,540
it's not too controversial but at the

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,840
same time

00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,640
they have gone after people for on

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,680
YouTube and YouTube we shut them down so

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,780
there's nothing to say you know the

00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,330
copyright cartels won't go after a

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,550
domain register if you have a domain

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:25,270
name and they do do that kind of thing

00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:28,240
to all the time so certainly taking a

00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,710
look and you know having you know

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,900
getting people to install library is

00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:33,040
probably a good move and keep in mind

00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,200
that a lot of this technology is already

00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,230
new and early so it's not totally

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,610
flawless but you got to start somewhere

00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,710
it's not like you can you can move off a

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,690
centralized platform overnight a lot of

00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,140
the you know underlying technology

00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,420
whether it be crypto currencies or

00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,550
YouTube replacements are still in their

00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:55,330
infancy to some degree but to be honest

00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:58,690
library does work pretty well I would

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:02,590
probably still right now self host your

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,900
videos or your audio just because it's

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,790
not 100% perfect there are videos if you

00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:11,020
try to do a search that might not play

00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:12,880
or might not come up properly so but I

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,800
think as time goes on you will see that

00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:19,810
it does get better I actually do know

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,870
Jeremy the the developer the main

00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,520
developer behind library and he's right

00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,700
actually out of New Hampshire near me

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,230
actually and he's yeah I mean they're

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,450
doing a great job I think it's it's just

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,060
a matter of time I don't know if those

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:36,220
are familiar with ipfs I might have said

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,460
earlier that library was based off ipfs

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:45,640
that's actually not correct I wasn't

00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:48,940
mistaken about that so you gave

00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,070
incredibly technical low-level talk and

00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,780
I think the audience really wants from

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:56,050
you a more high-level talk could you

00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:58,840
tell us five years from now your utopian

00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:01,390
vision in a world without Zuckerberg and

00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,520
without YouTube how do we get there what

00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:09,330
is it like and how how do we get to that

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,330
world stop using Facebook

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,480
um I never actually got on Facebook

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,820
myself so I'm not entirely familiar with

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,650
Facebook I'm probably the only person

00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,720
who is not looking to get off of

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,410
Facebook so I'm probably not the best

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,430
person to ask this but certainly I think

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,619
people around me are getting off of

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,730
Facebook now and lots of people and I'm

00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,730
talking about not even technical people

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,590
but less technical people so there's a

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,200
show called free talk live and there

00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,060
used to be something called the amp

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,130
group which is advertise this market and

00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:43,790
promote and it was basically a means of

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,530
people contributing money to promote the

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,180
radio show this is a syndicate is a

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,450
major syndicated radio show so that like

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,730
200 radio stations across the country

00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,140
it's a guy a couple satellites all from

00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:59,330
multiple contents it's also good at

00:35:54,140 --> 00:36:01,220
online following and basically for for

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:06,320
many years one of the things that you

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:08,600
got as a benefit to amping was you got

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,400
access to some sort of Facebook group I

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,140
think it was and I think that was a I

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,700
believe that was restricted to amp

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:20,859
somehow it was restricted to amp

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:27,609
contributors or users or whatever and

00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:29,690
that oh yeah okay so so Ian who was

00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:31,730
basically behind he's but he's the main

00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,350
person on the show I mean the main

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,530
co-host he runs the show it's his baby

00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:39,550
basically and so he actually got off of

00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:42,710
Facebook and for a little while he was

00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:46,760
continuing to log in just to keep an eye

00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:51,859
on on that little Facebook group and

00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,780
eventually he stopped so it's I don't

00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:57,410
think it's impossible I think it is

00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,970
possible and it's just a matter of you

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,230
know putting one step in front of the

00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,150
other you know let people know that

00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,100
you're not on Facebook it anymore tell

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,859
them where you are where are you on like

00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:11,000
I will give you I will tell you that I I

00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:12,800
have a mastodon account and you can

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,330
catch me on Mastodon now it's not it's

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,660
not a Facebook replacement don't get me

00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:20,240
wrong but if you're on Twitter certainly

00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,430
it's the Twitter replacement so I give

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,290
out my Mastodon instance

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,500
put it on business cards I put it on the

00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,329
website I you know when you join if you

00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,359
go to freedom decrypted calm and you

00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:32,800
click on join or trying if it's joint

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,869
NASA done no doing that's done would be

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,640
to actually sign up

00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,829
I think it's follow follow a mastadon is

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,660
what I have I think it's like Macedon

00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:43,319
dot follow or something like that and if

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,550
you click on that you will be able to

00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:48,760
follow just like you would maybe a

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,829
Twitter user and I think just by using

00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,809
these other alternative options and

00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:56,650
linking people to where can they get a

00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:59,319
mastodon account things like that you

00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,150
you'll quickly realize you will find

00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:04,270
that there is a lot of people following

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:06,730
you who you never even knew were on

00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,500
Mastodon and that's that's what I

00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,440
actually found out we get more people

00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,300
clicking on follow on the follow

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,490
Mastodon link and following us on

00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,660
Mastodon then we have people subscribing

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,040
to the email now we haven't had the

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,520
email option available for very long

00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,500
like maybe a week or two but it's still

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,970
like every day just about I'm having

00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,339
somebody click to follow for Mastodon

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:31,630
and that's a heck of a lot less then

00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:34,240
we've got for the for the email so it's

00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,220
it's getting popular and I know a lot of

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,170
non-technical people who are on Mastodon

00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,200
so if you're not on Mastodon and you're

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,880
a technical person I don't know where

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,210
you've been but you might want to get on

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:54,400
that's the time anybody else have

00:38:46,210 --> 00:39:01,869
questions ok I was just gonna say I've

00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:04,630
used the the OBS studio it's excellent

00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:07,210
it hasn't failed me one time not once

00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,609
the only failure is I made an error or

00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,369
didn't know exactly what I was doing it

00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:16,290
is it works so well I just want to say

00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:18,730
that it's it's easy to use everybody

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:21,040
yeah that's been my experience as well

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,650
and it's it's not like there's no

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,880
learning curve to it I think there is a

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,000
little bit of a learning curve to it

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,520
especially if you've never done audio or

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,430
video before I would say probably though

00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,380
the thing that's more complicated

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,660
was probably just getting like the mixer

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,069
set up and figuring out Oh you can't in

00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,640
actually a society it's something that

00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:43,690
was um oh how do I say this this was

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,430
something that was should have been

00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,329
obvious to me but I just didn't realize

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,490
it

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,050
we had a some sort of power cable I

00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,510
think crossing an audio cable and you

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,099
could just imagine what happens even if

00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,490
it's shield it if it's right next to it

00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:58,750
and there was static and other stuff but

00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,770
it was just actually sitting just

00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,510
getting that set up and figuring out

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,339
what our audio problems were we're so

00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:07,329
much more complicated than anything that

00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:09,550
had to do with OBS itself OBS is really

00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:12,339
quite straightforward and actually I

00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:15,040
actually now having learned it a little

00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:18,010
bit it's actually underwhelming I feel

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,670
in terms of like power and stuff it is

00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,530
it's powerful but it's also it's not in

00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,390
in a sense it's not like there's a lot

00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,640
of things that OBS is not gonna do it's

00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,530
it's good at what it does do which is

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,950
you know why live streaming but I think

00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:35,349
as far as like actual like video editing

00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:37,030
it's it's not really designed for that

00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,109
and it's actually something I why I did

00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:42,750
want to talk about a little bit about

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:45,760
before my time right now was other

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,440
solutions for like editing video there's

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,829
Thurs or audio for that matter

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,799
so there's programs like open shot now

00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:55,569
I'm not that familiar with KDE online I

00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:58,869
know if some people find that they find

00:40:55,569 --> 00:41:01,720
that they like that better personally I

00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:04,030
like open shot and it works for me I

00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,450
haven't ever figured out why people like

00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:10,690
and live I used to feel like it crashed

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:13,390
on me a lot and open shot seemed to be

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,559
better but it may just be the packaging

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,780
or a particular distribution or

00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,119
something along those lines that was the

00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,710
issue but there's a lot there's

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,299
different sorts of features and effects

00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,089
that you can use in order to create like

00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:27,130
intros with open shot and it's fairly

00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:30,280
easy to use I don't know if anybody's

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:33,190
used Kineo you know I'm not sure how to

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,799
pronounce his ki you know in in the past

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,410
but Linux has come a long ways in terms

00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:40,510
of video editors so there's a bunch to

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:42,549
choose from and there's all sorts of

00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,230
effects and there you probably won't

00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:45,600
have any problems with you know creating

00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:49,440
intros or anything like that

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,390
days or even just you know like little

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,440
promos like if you got a sponsor or

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:58,080
something like that not hard at all I

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,910
would say probably the only thing that

00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,800
I've learned is get yourself a

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,310
directional mic and not one of these

00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,710
hundred ollar

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:07,050
piece of junk mics that will pick up all

00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,430
the room audio that seems to be the

00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:13,380
trick to getting you know decent quality

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:15,510
audio out of your your setup and then of

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,100
course there's audacity I am probably

00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,190
mentioning things that most of you

00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:22,920
probably already know but um adagio

00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,940
audacity is good for editing audio I'm

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,190
not really sure there's much much more

00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,230
to say to that it's just it's an an

00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,120
audio editor so if you need to cut and

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:39,000
paste audio or something to that effect

00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:40,890
it works great Zen so many questions in

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,620
terms of distribution have you looked at

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:51,330
things like peer tube and other

00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:53,910
federated services I'm actually I'm

00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:55,500
aware of peer tube I'm not familiar with

00:42:53,910 --> 00:43:01,770
it I haven't personally looked at it

00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:06,210
really I have my partner has looked at

00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:08,820
it more in depth than I have I certainly

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,340
know he's excited about it I don't know

00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,360
how it compares to library or what the

00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,700
differences are though really

00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,930
but certainly it's something that you

00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,190
probably should be looking into if

00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,670
you're interested in decentralized

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:22,560
solutions to problems it is it is one of

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,670
those I know it's it goes down that path

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,130
basically so yeah

00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:34,980
there's anybody else have questions or

00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:39,500
comments from what I understand Macedon

00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:42,630
is a Federation of servers alright so

00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,730
what's this if I you know my persona

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,870
non-grata people don't like me they

00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,210
don't want to hear what I have to say

00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:51,690
yeah so I run my own Macedon server

00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:55,440
where I post - is that is that how it

00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:58,300
works you know I can drive around my own

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,080
server I could post of that yeah

00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:04,390
okay so yes yes so the next word I guess

00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,820
what's the stop other you know most

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,980
users they get their data from another

00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,470
Macedon server so what's to stop those

00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:16,000
servers from a not playing fair by the

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:17,650
protocol and just uh ignoring me okay so

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,880
that's actually a good question so

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,380
there's actually censorship in the some

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,900
sense built into mastodon network yeah

00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:30,970
so it's it's it's kind of along the

00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:32,950
lines of so an individual instance can

00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:36,220
kick you off if you're part of that

00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,690
instance so you do want to make sure

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,280
that you're part of an instance that is

00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:44,020
not gonna kick you off or you set up

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:48,370
your own instance right the other thing

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:50,680
is I think you can lock certain

00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,000
instances so potentially you know if

00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,800
they're socialists really don't like the

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,830
libertarians enough or a particular

00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:06,490
socialist instance they could

00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:11,080
potentially yeah yeah that's that's

00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:13,180
certainly possible I think I don't know

00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,040
that when they block it will actually

00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:18,940
prevent individual users I think the way

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,840
it usually works is oh okay I think we

00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,890
have an answer to this over here

00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:27,670
somebody knows more than I do just to

00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:28,750
answer your question if you okay the one

00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,750
as far as if you're running your own

00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:34,990
individual instance and someone decides

00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:36,850
to block you yes that instance then you

00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,620
are not immediately discoverable by

00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:48,300
people from that instance they can still

00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:48,300
subscribe to you though yes

00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,140
yes but it does give you the ability to

00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,670
reach the audience you want if you know

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,670
the people that are on that instance

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,560
trust ya if the people that are on that

00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,849
instance trust their admin to only block

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,490
things they want now whether that's a

00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:08,260
good idea or not is another issue but

00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:12,250
you will be reachable by everybody else

00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:14,020
so if your ideas you know can get out to

00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:22,000
everyone else on the Fed averse other

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:27,060
than that yeah well play fair doesn't

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,060
mean no moderation at all

00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,210
you know if mastodons it's an advise

00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:44,530
sharing is storing just in general you

00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:47,470
know there's a kind of you know scoring

00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:50,290
equation where you know this much data

00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:59,800
from a variety of other instances I

00:46:50,290 --> 00:47:01,599
think that it's it's entirely based on

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,770
what your instance owner decides they

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,300
want to listen to just as if you're

00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,619
doing your instance and you don't want

00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,710
to hear things from a particular other

00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:11,530
instance you may block them so everybody

00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:14,109
is every you know just like email email

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,329
could say hey this site is spam and you

00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:18,750
won't see messages from them you have to

00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:21,790
trust your admins to do that correctly

00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,500
yeah I will point out also just that

00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:24,819
this is why it's important to not

00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,810
everybody get on the same instance

00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:31,390
because then we just end up with another

00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:33,579
Facebook 10:30 Sunday at the Oracle

00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:37,569
ballroom I'm gonna get more into the

00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:41,470
social networking aspect of this how the

00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:46,980
plumbing of the Fed averse works so this

00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:49,599
is kind of yes it's a shameless plug

00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,190
yeah I would definitely encourage I

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,700
would definitely encourage people who

00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:56,700
looked at other go to other talks to

00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,960
learn more about some of these

00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,180
applications I talked about I didn't

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,710
want to go into any technical detail on

00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,030
like how to set them up a lot of its

00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,300
like there's gonna be tutorials out

00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,650
there

00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,720
if you have any questions on any of it

00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,610
given that I've already set it up and

00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,140
I've got links to it saved for most of

00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,780
the stuff already feel free to email me

00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,940
Chris at freedom decrypted comm and I'd

00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,650
be happy to send you links I also have

00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,210
like lists of equipment and stuff that I

00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:22,510
use personally in the studio that's

00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:25,180
worked well with free software so yeah I

00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,950
mean it's it's most of stuff is not that

00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,420
terribly hard it's some of the stuff

00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:32,020
that's a little bit harder to do is like

00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:39,520
probably like if you want to have your

00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:40,990
wordpress post go to your well not so

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,950
much mass zombies that's easy it does it

00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,510
automatically if you want it to

00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,490
automatically upload when you upload the

00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,710
video I guess is it's probably gonna be

00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,930
a little bit more complicated because

00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,870
not a plug-in to do that to say library

00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,370
for example there you can do if you're

00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:57,100
uploading to YouTube though like I said

00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,450
there is the YouTube connect thing that

00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,220
you can sign up for where it'll just

00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,190
sync everything to library automatically

00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,660
I mean it's it's not as ideal given that

00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,460
you're now still depending on YouTube

00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,370
and have you two blocks you that won't

00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,750
work anymore but um if it's if you know

00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,730
if you're not as controversial then

00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,470
maybe you know that will work fine for

00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,940
you for the moment until somebody comes

00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,100
out with a plug-in that you know does it

00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,810
automatically I've just hacked

00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,520
personally I'm just I've just basically

00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,710
hacked some code together to make it

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,480
work on our instance and it's not even

00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,360
though it's not even a hundred complete

00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,040
yet but it's not it's not if you're if

00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,190
you got some coding skills it's not that

00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,350
hard I'm by far not i mean i'm i've been

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:38,500
coding for a very long time but i'm by

00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:41,320
far not the most experienced coder i'm

00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:44,410
sure in this room so it's not that

00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:47,170
terribly difficult to basically script

00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,910
it to automatically upload you can just

00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,250
you can probably just hack i think i

00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:55,870
think you can just hack on the the

00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:59,200
mastodons plug-in itself to upload the

00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:01,030
video or something along those lines so

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,590
or yeah basically because there's

00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:04,000
comments so the reason it's a little bit

00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,910
more complicated is because there's

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,890
there's comments in addition to to the

00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,320
blog post in addition to the video and

00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:14,950
you've got to kind of align the two and

00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:17,470
then execute a command to then upload to

00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,920
library but like i said you don't really

00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,359
have to

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,299
that way you could just upload your own

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:24,960
video manually to library or manually to

00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:28,359
YouTube and then have the YouTube sync

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,770
or not YouTube I forget what it's called

00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,599
exactly but it's it's whatever the

00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,660
syncing thing is between YouTube and

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,040
library you'll you'll find it at the

00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,069
library

00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,460
I think it's ll be our why.com now

00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:44,400
URL but there you will see how to do

00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:48,609
that there's directions it's really easy

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,640
it's there's there is some manual stuff

00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:53,710
going on that's a service not a

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,109
decentralized aspect of it so keep that

00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,420
in mind I mean technically you know that

00:50:56,109 --> 00:51:01,210
could that could potentially be cut off

00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,470
I'm not I'm not entirely sure you know

00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:05,500
you're gonna get cut off with any of

00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:08,260
these services but you know I mean

00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:10,780
depending on where you go possibly maybe

00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,579
somebody will want to do a cut you off I

00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,430
don't given that there's a libertarian

00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:17,740
behind that particular service I kind of

00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:19,119
doubt you're gonna get cut off but even

00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,710
if you're like a conservative or

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,540
something or I don't know you're a

00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,770
piracy supporter or whatever it is I

00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,420
don't think that you're gonna get

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:28,359
censored but there's you never know I

00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:31,089
have seen I have seen people say they're

00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:32,530
libertarian and then go and do stuff

00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:38,460
that is just not very libertarian issue

00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:43,809
so any other questions comments thoughts

00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:46,020
criticisms ah good question so I'm gonna

00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,710
say go to freedom to crypto calm and

00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:52,059
click on the follow

00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,950
Mastodon link because ie I'm not

00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:56,530
actually sure well my handle is I think

00:51:53,950 --> 00:52:02,950
it's I think it might be mister do you

00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:06,849
know my handle okay so it's miss mister

00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:12,359
underscore penguin at social dot Bob

00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:14,470
called me is my handle for Mastodon and

00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:17,230
shockingly somebody in the room actually

00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:18,910
knows it and I don't I do have quite a

00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,710
few followers and so I've been on a

00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,670
little bit a little while now but um

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,670
yeah

00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:43,980
my personal preference for messaging

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,840
platforms is a good question um so if

00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:50,280
we're talking about like genuinely

00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:52,920
decentralized matrix and riot are

00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,130
probably probably the way to go but

00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,210
they're still kind of the development is

00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,280
you know it's still in the works it's

00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,970
still kind of data it seems to actually

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,440
work pretty well

00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:08,010
to be honest but it's think gbg in terms

00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,710
of difficulty if you are actually taking

00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:12,119
advantage of all of the encryption part

00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,730
encryption parts and I don't necessarily

00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:17,070
know what the advantages are in a group

00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,410
chat like environment unless you it's

00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,550
small enough where you know when you

00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,960
know everybody has their own system

00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:24,800
secured and you don't have any

00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,060
infiltrators or anything of that nature

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,230
which is something to think about it's

00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:31,410
what is one of the things with active if

00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:33,720
you do any kind of activism you're gonna

00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,790
be you're gonna be in a situation where

00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,930
you know if you're doing something in a

00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,520
small group you might be able keep it

00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,930
secret but as soon as you get to any

00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:44,490
threat level of any kind to another

00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,170
party will just say adversary you're

00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:49,740
gonna end up with infiltrators and at

00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,700
that point it's like you know all bets

00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,900
are off it doesn't matter how much

00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,839
encryption you use it's not really gonna

00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:57,330
work but it's still something I think we

00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,060
should all be trying to use just so that

00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:03,119
those who do need it and can take

00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,619
advantage of it will not be you know

00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,119
they you won't be able to pick out the

00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,589
people who are using using encryption

00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,200
for whatever it is you don't want them

00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:12,240
to use it for and then what am I

00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,140
actually using in the real world

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,440
unfortunately

00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,849
tell them and telegram is is so telegram

00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,980
is free software but the back end is

00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:21,960
proprietary or the servers that you're

00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,330
gonna hit your proprietary so like you

00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,089
can be potentially shut down or cut off

00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:30,109
it's definitely not ideal now I do

00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:32,940
believe there's a libertarian behind

00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:35,400
telegram and I do know that telegram is

00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,380
fairly decent in terms of not getting

00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,380
cut off like if you're in say Russia for

00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:43,530
example Russia had a situation where

00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:46,200
they basically tried to shut telegram

00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,870
down by blocking like every single IP

00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,860
and

00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:53,710
basically they they undermined the very

00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:56,470
Internet of the accessibility like for

00:54:53,710 --> 00:55:00,700
major websites so like in their attempts

00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:02,980
to block telegram so it certainly seems

00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:07,690
to be a fairly decent tool especially

00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:11,200
for some groups you know that in some

00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:14,470
governments may not like I know I think

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:18,880
China actually DDOS'd the telegram

00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:20,880
servers here with tell them as I think I

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,440
may be in the tow them in Square

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,900
protests or something or no it was it

00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,000
was really to Hong Kong I think but in

00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,260
any event the point is I think they may

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,800
have been somewhat successful with the

00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:36,790
DDoS attack so it may not be perfect but

00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:39,040
it you know it's it's not it's it's

00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:40,870
certainly better than say I don't know

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:46,980
what is Microsoft wasn't Microsoft to

00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:48,850
have some sort of instance teams okay

00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,340
okay I'm not even I wasn't even thinking

00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,210
of that I was thinking of some video

00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,540
Skype Skype that's what I was thinking

00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,540
oh yeah

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,660
Skype is yeah I know I know Scott

00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,560
doesn't have peered up here and I that

00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,390
would be terrible let's definitely

00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:06,250
censored that's actually a backdoor to

00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:07,540
NSA kind of stuff now I believe yeah

00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:10,780
XMPP

00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:13,960
I mean XMPP can be DDoS though means you

00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:17,650
have centralized servers and also yeah I

00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:19,420
like XMPP personally but it's it's a

00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:22,050
good question yeah I mean so one of the

00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:25,480
reasons I mean unfortunately telegram I

00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:27,070
don't trust telegram to a degree because

00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,720
so they one of the things they

00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:33,070
advertised is encryption but the problem

00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,770
is that their their encryption I think

00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:38,670
only works or it did only work on

00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:40,840
Android and every phone is backdoored so

00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:45,580
how is that supposed to work

00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:47,290
I don't know I don't necessarily think

00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,000
that you know there's there's malware in

00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:51,190
the software the code is available I

00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,390
think it's like GPL maybe even three

00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,190
license something like that

00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,710
maybe somebody else knows I don't have

00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,820
talked my head but I I know the sources

00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,900
service I know I've looked into it

00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,869
before because I wouldn't have installed

00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:08,549
on my own computer

00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:14,450
but yeah I think matrix is the only one

00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:14,450
that's been like audited outside of them

00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:25,229
audited by who don't know the name

00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:34,859
offhand some third party so yeah so some

00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:36,720
third-party audited matrix yeah the NSA

00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:41,130
audited matrix yeah I don't know I don't

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:43,529
know i yeah i mean i think matrix is

00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,569
potentially the way forward I don't know

00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:47,700
in terms of ease of use they're supposed

00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:50,190
to add some features to it that will

00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,989
make it easier to use um I haven't used

00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:54,119
it actually in like probably six months

00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:56,670
because it was unfortunately I tried to

00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:58,950
get people using it and unfortunately

00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:01,529
there were enough people that were not

00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,660
that technical it was just not it was

00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:05,640
not working it was not working for the

00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,680
group that I was using it within but if

00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,589
you've got a more technical group you

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,999
may find that it works adequately and in

00:58:10,589 --> 00:58:13,589
the future you may find that it works

00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:15,450
adequately for less technical people but

00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:17,759
when you're trying to deal with like GPG

00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,229
keys and and again these weren't GPT

00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:22,109
keys specifically but you know public

00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:24,690
key core photography and there's no

00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:27,180
simpler or solution other than checking

00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:28,289
a long you know set a code digits and

00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,940
things and you got to be there in the

00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:32,369
room in the same place and same time and

00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,630
everything else it's it's a challenge it

00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:35,519
certainly it definitely feels like

00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:38,430
something that was designed at least up

00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:41,549
to this point for developers and you

00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:46,469
know technical users not your end users

00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:50,900
but I don't know any more questions

00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:50,900
comments thoughts criticisms

00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:03,810
was I was holding back on trying to say

00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:05,550
all this but um to me this you know we

00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:08,840
talking about these centralizing the web

00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:14,310
and it sounds to me in many ways

00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:17,810
you know how the Internet at least

00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,810
