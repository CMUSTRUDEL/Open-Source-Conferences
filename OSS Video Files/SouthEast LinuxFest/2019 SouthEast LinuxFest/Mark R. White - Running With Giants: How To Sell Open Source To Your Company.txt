Title: Mark R. White - Running With Giants: How To Sell Open Source To Your Company
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
As technical professionals, our acumen for making our ideas about technology actionable are, stereotypically, somewhat lacking. My talk is about how to take tried and true sales methodologies and put them to use in convincing our respective organizations to implement these technologies. This talk generally comes across as good sales advice with a large helping of self-help material. I call the presentation Running with Giants because it's specifically geared at taking on the big corporations such as Microsoft and IBM.

this is thank working outstanding all

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,740

we'll get this thing started but for

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,830
those of you here thanks for coming

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,930
because I know most of us are hungover

00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:49,200
and tired and you know so I do

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:51,899
appreciate it we were yeah it was about

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,040
what 3:45 when they finally like you got

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,680
to go and uh and then I rented some guys

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,210
down the hallway and they were like you

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:07,890
want to go to Waffle House and I'm like

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:10,020
absolutely yeah

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,320
and so we got back from waffles like

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,340
5:30 yeah

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:21,350
needless to say when I went into the

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:26,340
room the wife was not happy but Garret

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,959
hey man thanks for coming dude for the

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,730
record I really appreciate are you

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,250
showing up because seriously I have

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,959
literally given talks on you know South

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,019
East Linux Fest Sunday afternoons to

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,910
empty rooms so because obviously they

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,080
record it and they stream it so you you

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,400
have to give the talk whether anybody

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:49,230
shows and it's checkout time and it's

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,750
Father's Day and oh thank you thank you

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:58,489
so happy Father's Day to those of you or

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,489
Father's and yep

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,410
yep

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,150
which one I'm sorry dude I was

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,040
it's how a 25w is what it is but I don't

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,870
know what they call it locally like it's

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,780
probably like LaFollette freeway or

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,090
something but you know but yeah it's a

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,440
it's it's it's highway 25 W until it

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,930
gets to downtown will fall out and then

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,040
it breaks off and 25 W kind of cuts up

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,680
through the middle of the mountains and

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,480
then if you go straight you end up being

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,640
on highway 61 which runs out all the way

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:32,720
up to pal Valley into the Cumberland Gap

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:34,270
in Virginia so yes so hopefully my mic

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,530
will not die

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:42,980
all right so let's get this started

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:44,840
11:35 so thank you all for coming for

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,070
those of you know me I am mark white but

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,190
if you want to find me online you'll

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,770
find me under my nom de plume of Linux

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,610
Oberle that is where my blog is my

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,170
Twitter handle etc etc I do a little bit

00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,970
of blogging a little bit of consulting

00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,990
so there's some definitely some

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,920
information out there if you're

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:09,200
interested in it so I've been involved

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:12,050
with open source for about 22 years now

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,690
I started with Debian in the late 90s I

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,580
worked with a number of Debian package

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,740
maintainer doing package testing for

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,560
those guys for about a decade

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,020
I left the Debian project a few years

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,030
back currently working with a dev one

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,990
project which is basically Debian

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,660
without systemd

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,710
so if you're looking for a solid Linux

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,080
platform for your servers feel free to

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,210
check out dev 1 I am running in

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,560
production in two different startups so

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,900
it is very very stable and easy to use

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,300
so running with Jon's how to sell

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,000
open-source to your organization or

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,200
pretty much any other idea so that's

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,060
tech people we tend to be a little a

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,040
little autistic in our delivery and I

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,100
say that in an endearing way because I

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,070
actually do have ASD something I've

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,560
struggled with my entire life and I've

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,320
learned to embrace it you know in later

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,960
years specifically in my early 30s got

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,250
some help with that and so now I'm

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,230
trying to help other people deal with

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,430
how we deliver our message

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:22,340
to people who are non-technical folks so

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,220
running with John's what does it mean

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,770
it means that as open source advocates

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,750
we have to compete with very large

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,950
companies people who have a whole lot of

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:36,680
resources you know up until recently

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,410
Microsoft was a fairly anti open source

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,110
company and they were seeing you know as

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,740
big blue the devil whatever you wanted

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,160
to call them however as of recent with

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,010
their with their acquisition of github

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,570
and their push of the you know Linux

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,150
subsystem in Windows they're actually

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:59,120
starting to embrace it a bit but there's

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,640
still a massive corporation which does

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,830
not like open source competition they

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,080
work hard every day to push us out of

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,210
the picture same things happen with IBM

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,830
now that they've acquired Red Hat Red

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,050
Hat's gonna be working really hard to

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,640
make sure that the open source folks

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,460
aren't nearly as successful as we used

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,800
to be because IBM is not an open source

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,260
company they're all about profit so now

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,550
our bar for competition has raised quite

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,200
a bit over the last few years being the

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:32,630
the push of open source within those two

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:35,360
companies Microsoft and IBM so can we do

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,760
this can we compete with those guys we

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,560
can but it's not gonna be hard I mean

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,090
it's gonna be very hard it's on be easy

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,180
and this is some tried-and-true methods

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,130
of you know sales engineering and sales

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,940
methodology that that's going to help us

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:56,360
get that done the talk may sound a

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,860
little bit like a self-help book but you

00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,480
know that's kind of what it is for folks

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,160
like me who struggle with interpersonal

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:08,390
reactions when we're trying to talk to

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:11,150
people who don't speak our language so

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,530
open source it's hard work very hard

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,980
work I don't know how many of you at

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,930
work on open source projects but I work

00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,820
on a couple and the truth is I don't

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,210
give as much time to those open source

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,130
projects as I probably should however

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,780
you know as all of us do I have

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,120
responsibilities you know I have a

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,580
family I have a couple dogs

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,680
a job have a have a disabled father I

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,080
take care of so I've got a lot of I've

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,700
got a lot of responsibilities so I can't

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,260
always dedicate the amount of time that

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,740
I really need to to my open source

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,810
projects and I assume most of us don't

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,970
because it's hard work and it's going to

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,339
be harder in the future with you know

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,990
corporate entities such as IBM and

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,440
Microsoft pushing into the open source

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,450
space and you know what no one cares

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,970
that it's hard no one cares that we have

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,790
these pet projects that we care about

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,500
dev one dev one is very dear to me I've

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,680
been working on it for I guess about

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,410
three years now and I have a lot of

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,890
reasons why I do not like the system the

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,080
ecosystem and I'm even starting to feel

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,080
that way quite a bit about the gnome

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,080
ecosystem within Linux and dev one

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,650
excludes both of those it's a very open

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,600
source purist distribution and so but

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,029
that's my passion and nobody cares about

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,029
passions nobody cares about your pets

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:34,100
your pets are not their pets so we need

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,560
to remember that nobody cares that oh I

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,470
hate systemd but you think it's CEO is

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,480
company ABC LLC cares no they don't care

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,190
they don't care if I hate systemd they

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,510
want to know can I provide them a

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,500
solution that's gonna save them time and

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,260
money and make them more profitable

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,360
that's all they care about so when we're

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,279
you know kind of constructing our

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,560
message to people who aren't in the

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,000
technical community we need to remember

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,850
that they don't care about our projects

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,130
very very intelligent man I know goes by

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,839
the handle cattle as online he's

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,779
actually was a senior developer in the

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,209
dev 1 project and he's a PhD in computer

00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,440
science very very smart man probably one

00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:14,720
of these smartest human beings I've ever

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,010
met my life actually said in a meeting

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,140
that he and I was having one set

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,600
engineers are not interested in Crusades

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,730
and the truth is neither c-level people

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,529
nobody cares about your crusade nobody

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,510
cares that you're changing the world all

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,670
they want to know is can you make their

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,570
job easier can you save them money can

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:35,660
you make them more profitable so we have

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,030
to do is we have to look at open source

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,089
as a brand and it's a massive umbrella

00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,030
so unfortunately all open source

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,070
projects get lumped together

00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,950
so you know whether you're a Red Hat

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,890
person or if a door person or a Cintas

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,510
person or a dev one person or you know

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,080
you work on some other open source

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:58,570
things like in map or you know get lab

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,880
or you're working on you know any of

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,810
those types of things get T or you know

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,290
you're doing your own open source

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,480
project unfortunately we all get lumped

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,920
in together we're open source

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,010
we're not supported we don't have

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,420
corporate entities behind us and

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,850
unfortunately we're all linked whether

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,800
we like it or not so we live and dies

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,510
the community so all this starts and

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,200
ends with us you know nobody's going to

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,440
do this for us

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,930
and this entire talk is about how to

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,330
enable ourselves to make open source

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,710
successful in the commercial world and

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,870
not even just in the commercial world

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,760
maybe just in your own company maybe you

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,620
work at a company you're out you're you

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,690
know you're you're a rail shop and you

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,970
want to say hey I want a more open

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,320
source oriented Linux here and you need

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,570
to make a push to that maybe you want to

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,760
move to CentOS maybe you want to move to

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,950
you know Debian maybe you want to move

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,650
to Gen 2 or Slackware you know any of

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,780
those really truly open source Linux

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,830
a--'s that are out there and this is

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,960
hopefully gonna help you get that done

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,450
so starts with you so I came up with

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,830
these five tenets and I actually didn't

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,660
come up with these gonna be honest most

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,250
of this came from Splunk I'm sure most

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,140
you guys are familiar with Splunk if you

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,420
work in the technical world great

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,610
company I worked there for a while as a

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,140
sales engineer and the one thing that

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,160
Splunk did really well is that they

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,610
trained their salespeople

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,170
extraordinarily well and as a sales

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,550
engineer I got to go through all their

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,410
professional services engineering

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:27,190
training as well as their Account

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,900
Manager training and it is it was very

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,690
good training and so they they kind of

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,580
teach you how to do this from scratch so

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,110
after going through those things these

00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,820
are some of the tenants that I came up

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,700
with that helps you be a better

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,740
salesperson helps you advocate for your

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,910
project whatever it is whatever you're

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,800
trying to implement across your

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,240
organization or even to a third-party

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,080
organization if you're running say a

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,230
consulting company so advocacy

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,750
deliverability the concept of being a

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,920
trusted advisor how we shape our message

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,899
to the people we talk to

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,179
and the hunter-killer mentality and that

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,589
last one is really its sales lingo and

00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:08,559
we'll get pretty deep into that later

00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:11,079
so first advocacy so what is it what

00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,799
does it do for us how does it apply to

00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:17,079
us so networking in biz dev so as an

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,449
advocate what are we doing to get our

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,119
open-source projects out there okay I

00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:24,389
want to say number one right off I am

00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:26,619
guilty of not doing enough advocacy and

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,410
business development for my open source

00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:31,989
projects you know as someone who works

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,819
on a Linux distro I need to be calling

00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:36,669
cloud providers I need to be calling

00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:39,669
digitalocean and hitting up the the guys

00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,769
from Linode and Rackspace and SoftLayer

00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:45,309
and Amazon and making sure that I have

00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:47,350
images of you know my my open-source

00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:49,389
distribution in their clouds because I

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,879
haven't done that and you know what I'm

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,499
feeling so I need to work better so I'm

00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,480
really talking to myself as much as I'm

00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,369
talking to anyone out there so

00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,980
networking in biz dev this is very

00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,509
important so as open source advocates we

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,489
need to get out there we need to

00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,139
advocate for our brands we need to be

00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,999
doing business development making sure

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:08,980
that our project whatever it is is

00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:12,339
getting into the places it needs to be

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,589
to get recognized to be successful and

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,239
we have to take it seriously

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,600
unfortunately open-source it's kind of a

00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:21,579
job and and I know we come here and the

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
southeast Linux Fest is one of the great

00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,699
parts of the open-source community

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,470
because we come here we go to all these

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:28,239
great talks and we have a massive number

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,129
of phenomenal talks at this at this

00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:32,860
conference every year we have a lot of

00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,959
fun we have a great community the

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,249
camaraderie here is unmatched but when

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,989
we leave here it's time to go back to

00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:39,999
work it's time to get out there be

00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:42,309
serious start hitting up business

00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,809
executives touching base making phone

00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:45,669
calls sending emails talking to

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,769
engineers making sure that we're getting

00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,850
whatever project were working on in

00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,839
front of the people that can make a

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:56,109
difference to build our footprint we as

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,129
individuals represent our brand so you

00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:00,519
know for dev one

00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,799
I meant their brand if I screw up in the

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,600
technical world if I see something on

00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,309
Twitter that offends a bunch of people

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,289
well guess what I've heard they've won

00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,999
so you got to remember that as

00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:10,510
individual for whatever project you work

00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:12,550
on

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,769
you're representing that brand and it's

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,329
an unfortunate truth and honestly it

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,550
kind of sucks it shouldn't be that way

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:20,560
but that's the that's just how the world

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,579
works and so when you're out there doing

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,500
things when you're out there

00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:24,910
representing yourself you're also

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,680
representing whatever open-source

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,019
projects you're working for you do

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,149
represent that brand and yes open-source

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,250
as a whole is a brand and whatever

00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:36,459
individual project you're working on is

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,560
also a brand so whatever you do reflects

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:40,240
back on not only your individual project

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
but it's going to reflect back on the

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
open-source community as a whole and

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,139
we've seen some really good examples of

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,110
how not to be from a lot of open source

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,519
leadership without mentioning any names

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:56,529
unless your names

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:59,170
lonnis or Leonard but anyway so we know

00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,910
how not to act so now we have to work on

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,680
how do we act and that's that's very

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,970
important so remember open source

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,920
whether it's the open source community

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:12,519
as a whole or your individual open

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:14,889
source project it is a brand so

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,860
deliverability what does this mean

00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:20,079
so as nerds we think of deliverability

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,790
and we start thinking about continuous

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,470
delivery right continuous integration

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,389
well that's not what this is about this

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,910
is sales delivery this is personal

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,610
delivery and the question is as an

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,040
individual do you deliver are you

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,170
delivering on your open-source project

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,910
are you putting the time in to make sure

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,699
your open source project is successful

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:43,089
I'm going to tell you right now I do not

00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:45,490
do this I fell at this every single day

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,810
I want to put more time into open source

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,670
but like I said we all have

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,310
responsibilities outside of our projects

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,149
and I'm not very good at balancing these

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:57,220
things and I'm working on getting better

00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:59,589
and once again I ask if not what's

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,360
stopping you you know for me it's just

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,250
personal responsibilities I have a

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,169
family I have a job I have a disabled

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,880
father those things all pull me away

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,100
from my open-source work and I really do

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,500
want to more do more open-source work so

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,770
I have to do a better job of finding a

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,270
work life open-source balance so that I

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,750
can do all the things that I need to do

00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:22,959
in life do you sell yourself as a brand

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,280
you know are you out there representing

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,470
yourself and

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,960
making others realize that you actually

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,310
have something to offer and what that's

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,990
going to do if you're doing this

00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,280
properly it's gonna create this roll

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,510
called the trusted advisor and we're

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,270
actually gonna talk that about that a

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,770
little bit more in just a minute and are

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,540
you developed your in contacts this goes

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,070
back to the previous slide when we were

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,170
talking about networking in biz death

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,550
are you out there talking to people who

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,130
can make a difference for your project

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,780
are you know I'll work on a Linux distro

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,300
what am i doing to call it cloud

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,210
providers and saying hey can I get an

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,040
image of my distro in your cloud for

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,140
general use you know as one of the

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,500
default options I should be doing that

00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,980
and I haven't so I'm failing but I can

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,900
do better

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:11,170
uh-huh so the next is a trusted advisor

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,420
so in sales methodology there's a book

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,720
that came out called the Challenger

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,700
method and it talks about the different

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,880
types of salespeople and the ones that

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,740
are most successful and the single most

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,600
successful type of sales person

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,970
continuously is the one called the

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
trusted advisor and that's who you want

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,950
to become to be successful in selling

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,540
your idea your project your open source

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,610
initiative to anyone whether it's your

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,860
own company a third-party company is a

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,110
consultant a government agency whatever

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,690
those things are you have to become the

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,020
trusted adviser and just what that means

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,700
is is you got to be an SME a subject

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,490
matter expert and usually a more than

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,270
one vertical you want to be the guy that

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,550
when or the gal that when someone has a

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,770
question they're gonna call you up and

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,510
say hey hey Mark I've got a question

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,250
about such-and-such I know you're not a

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,870
network engineer but we're getting ready

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,590
to about new switches do you have an

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,050
opinion on this

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,000
and as a trusted adviser even if you're

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,910
not an expert on that you need to have

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,340
an educated opinion on things that are

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,800
peripheral to your primary project so

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,990
you need to be the guy or the girl

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,180
that's out there that saying hey I can

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,190
answer your questions you want people to

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,050
see you as a source of knowledge and

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,120
information that way when you go to them

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,710
and say hey I'd really like to get

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,940
really like for you to get my open

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,950
source project to chance they're

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,950
actually gonna listen to you you know

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,010
and this is this is a very important

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,660
thing and this just isn't good for

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,370
an open source this is for really

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,560
anything in your life you know even

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,570
personal relationships you know this is

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,580
something that you know I could really

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,830
do a better job of even in my own

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,080
marriage you know is I have to be that

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,030
trusted advisor for my spouse I have to

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,070
know I want her to know that she can

00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,450
believe in me and trust in me and if she

00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,430
comes to me with a question I'm gonna

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,750
have an educated answer or I want to

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,820
work really hard to get her a good

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,750
answer you know you've got to build that

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,770
trust with everyone around you and last

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,220
but not least how do you communicate

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,290
this and a lot of that goes into shaping

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,460
your message especially when you're

00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:20,190
selling an open-source project as

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,730
technology professionals once again we

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,250
tend to be very very dry on our delivery

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,240
you know as someone who has ASD and has

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,000
struggled with interpersonal

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,400
relationships for my entire life always

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,900
had a hard time even when I had the

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,250
better idea of getting people to

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,920
understand that my idea was actually

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:42,060
better because here I am I see a problem

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,400
I see a solution and I can't get them to

00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,640
see what I see so you got to work on

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,840
shaping your message and how do you

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,280
shape your message well first and

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,650
foremost you've got to be aware of your

00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,970
delivery you know as someone who has ASD

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,050
I struggle with autism

00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:00,330
I'm very dry I say this is how it is a B

00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,310
and C and there's no emotional

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,320
inflection what I do it's just this is

00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,510
just knowledge this is just fact and

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,080
when people don't see it because normal

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,880
human beings have emotional responses

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,280
it's very frustrating for people like me

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,780
and honestly for most people in the

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,870
technical community even those of you

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,580
that are on the spectrum it's it's very

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,160
hard because we see everything is

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,380
engineers we see we see a problem we see

00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,150
a solution and it's like why can't you

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,540
see the solution what's wrong with you

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,400
are you stupid this is so easy like my

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,380
13 month old son can do this why can't

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
you do this you know and it's like it's

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,460
so frustrating and you're like why can't

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
these people see what's going on but you

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,570
know what you can't act like that you

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,110
can't be a brilliant jerk your tongue

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,790
matters you know and this is very

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,040
important you can't go out there and

00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,690
yell and scream and kick and fight and

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,820
you know because that's

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,580
I'm a Marine I'm a marine with autism

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,590
that is literally my first response to

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,180
everything oh it's not gonna work the

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,620
way I want it I'm gonna break it I'm

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,210
gonna break it till it works the way I

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,890
want it you don't want to listen to me I

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,810
want to force you to listen to me you

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,230
know it's just it's just my nature you

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,510
know and I have to fight really hard

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,550
really hard to kind of counterbalance

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,500
that when I'm talking to people in

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:19,020
professional environments you know I

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,490
have to find a way to deliver and shape

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,150
my message in a way that they're gonna

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,950
understand what my message actually is

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,570
and adopt whatever I'm trying to

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,820
convince them to adopt whether it's a

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,830
product whether it's a policy I do a lot

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,540
of DevOps consulting this is very

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,390
important in consulting you know when I

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,970
go out and I tell a company hey your

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,340
entire company is broke your

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,930
methodologies your policies everything

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,720
you're doing is making you less

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,490
efficient right now I can help you be

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,410
more efficient I can help you build a

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,720
better product but if I don't deliver

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,330
that message right with the right tone

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,760
in the right way nobody's gonna listen

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,170
to me they're gonna be like that dude is

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,960
a giant a-hole

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,060
he is a jerk and even if I'm right even

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,520
if I'm very smart it does not matter

00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:10,040
they're never going to implement the

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,040
things that I try to communicate to them

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:18,870
so the hunter-killer mentality this is

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,820
actually way less violent than it sounds

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,830
but it's the concept of going out there

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,280
and getting what you need to be

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,570
successful so if you're like myself if

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,030
you're a guy who's working on an open

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,740
source Linux distribution what are you

00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,510
doing to make that successful are you

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,090
out there hunting for opportunities

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,880
where you can get your platform in front

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,100
of the most people am i calling cloud

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,590
providers am i saying hey what do I have

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,780
to do to get a version my distro on a

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,290
permanent image for general release at

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,430
your company you know and then not only

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,080
do you have to go out there and hunt

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,750
those you have to kill those

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,290
opportunities you have to make sure that

00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,330
you deliver you have to be goal oriented

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,790
you have to be like okay here's what I'm

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,830
going to do I'm going to contact a dozen

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,630
cloud providers and I want at least two

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,150
of them to doctor

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,799
to adopt using my image as a standard

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,480
image for their company and then you

00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:13,220
just got to work until you're successful

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,500
and this is where the hard work comes in

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,140
this is not easy I was a sales engineer

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,990
at Splunk our cell cycles were about

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,150
nine months long do you know how hard it

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,870
is to stay on one opportunity for nine

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,100
straight months it's miserable but at

00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,230
the end of it we were pretty successful

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,600
we didn't we had a few government

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,150
agencies that after nine months we were

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,730
doing nine figure deals with those guys

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,200
so but we had to stay on it nine months

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,020
and it's the same thing for open-source

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,760
you got to focus you got to stay

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,299
goal-oriented and then you've got to

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,740
close you got to kill it it's so easy in

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,270
life to get distracted I mean the

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,510
world's worst of this

00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:55,280
I was actually kind of working on an

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,470
open-source project called Mayans the

00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,659
the open insulin project and the truth

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,000
is I dropped the ball on it I dropped

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:03,710
the ball on it because I owe them some

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,860
stuff and I didn't get it to him in time

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,960
and it's just because job got away kid

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,909
got in the way you know the wife needed

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,770
me and I had to live up to my

00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,140
responsibilities and I didn't do a good

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,409
job of balancing this and I didn't close

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,460
the opportunity so if my personal brand

00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,309
suffered because I dropped the ball on

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:25,429
this so we're not perfect we all screw

00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,559
up we all make mistakes it happens the

00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,809
only thing you can do is turn around

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,360
remedy the best you can and move on but

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,450
always always be focused on your goal

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,630
and closing that goal in sales they talk

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,520
about the concept of ABC always be

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,320
closing always be closing

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,820
what do you got to do to close this deal

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:51,220
what do you got to do to achieve your

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:55,520
goal so don't lose sight of that so now

00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,169
are you ready to run are we ready to run

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,179
with these shots are we ready to compete

00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,980
with the IBM / Red Hat's of the world

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:03,080
are we ready to compete with the

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,150
Microsoft's of the world and even some

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,940
of our own open-source brothers and

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:10,039
sisters who are corporations you know if

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,870
you're if you're a truly open source

00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,780
Linux distro you're going to end up

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,090
competing with sousei and Abu - and

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,890
they've got big corporations behind them

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,320
so those those are those

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,990
big obstacles to overcome the

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,950
competitors aren't slowing down

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,320
Microsoft's not going to take the next

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,910
six months off IBM's not going to send

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,370
their entire company to Aruba so that

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,590
you can catch up you know if you want

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,480
your your open source initiative your

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,010
idea your project your consulting

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,250
company whatever you're working on if

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:44,330
you want it to be successful you have to

00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:48,920
work at it every single day they hate us

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:51,260
mostly you know Microsoft has done a

00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,330
really good job of embracing the open

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,790
source community later lately however

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,310
they're not doing that out of altruism

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,020
who thinks you know Bill Gates is out

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,580
there saying you know what let me go

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,370
talk to Steve Ballmer or whoever the

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,870
current CEO of Microsoft is I don't

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,900
really follow Microsoft because I'm not

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,190
really a big fan of those guys but uh

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,020
you know let me go talk to the you know

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,940
CEO and let's start let's start a

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,650
non-profit section of mock yourself

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,310
that's just gonna do open source that's

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,560
not gonna happen

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,600
those guys they have shareholders they

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,750
have stockholders they're there to make

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,340
money so you know what if we're a

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,950
competitor and we're giving our wares

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,500
away for free Oh guess what I run an

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,050
open source Linux distro it's faster

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,890
more stable and easier to use in Windows

00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,780
Server and I'll give it to you for free

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,520
Microsoft's not gonna like that IBM Red

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,720
has something like that canonical is not

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,190
going to like that so we're competing

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,290
against all these guys there's open

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,560
source advocates and you know what they

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:52,160
do mostly hate us because they do not

00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:55,760
want that open source competition so we

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,770
have to work that much harder and I've

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,800
actually had a lot of interactions with

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:03,350
some of these guys guys at Red Hat you

00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,110
know especially you know specific teams

00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:08,330
like the systemd team those guys they're

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,300
not nice people you know and they don't

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,460
like us so you know we have to we have

00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,990
to work really hard to overcome the fact

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,780
that they have all these resources

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,970
behind them they have loads of money to

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,130
work with they have thousands of paid

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,960
employees to do what we're trying to do

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,230
in our two hours of spare time every day

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,740
so it's very hard for us but we can't

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,730
lose sight it's easy to get off track

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,310
forget what your goal is

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,160
it's

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,530
been easier to inject your own bias once

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,570
again you have to remember even though

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,970
there are our pet projects they're not

00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,640
their pet projects you know people don't

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,250
care about our Crusades our passions

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,280
once again it comes back can you make my

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,080
life easier can you save me money can

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,240
you make me more profitable that's what

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,670
it all comes down to so don't lose sight

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,480
and don't inject your own boss don't use

00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:02,790
your passion for you know you know a

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,260
persuasive argument for trying to get

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,680
someone to adopt your open-source

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,680
platform

00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:26,880
exactly yep so the statement was that

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,190
you know when you're trying to explain

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,020
someone who you know is a potential user

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,460
of open-source and you're saying you

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,860
know the first thing we say is open that

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,810
source advocates to say this is open

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,570
source this is freedom this is this is

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,870
good for you but to the you know common

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,730
person that's actually a negative thing

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:46,140
so yeah you're absolutely right you're

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,180
absolutely right and that's what happens

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,550
so we have to remember our bosses

00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,230
they're not their bosses you know we

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,900
were you know we don't need to get into

00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:57,000
that you know that type of mindset

00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,980
because if we do we are going to fail we

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,720
are going to fail I mean it's great to

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,850
have passion it's great to use that

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,830
passion to drive you you just can't you

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,510
know inject that passion into

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:14,730
conversations especially sales

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:18,180
conversations so and in closing nothing

00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,760
is guaranteed okay so as a as an open

00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,400
source advocate as an open source sales

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,400
person you can do everything right and

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,040
still fail you can do everything you

00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,900
should have done and still fail you can

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,000
go out there you can talk to the

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,950
companies you can so consult for the

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,660
companies you can work with them for six

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,910
months you can convince them to give

00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,380
your software a try they know they may

00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,030
love your software but at the end of the

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,220
day you might do everything right and

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,840
you can still fail so don't take it

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,250
personally don't

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,809
take it personally you just got to get

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,120
back up on that horse and keep ridin the

00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:57,600
other thing is work hard play hard live

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,549
life once again it goes back to balance

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,549
I've not found a good balance for my

00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:04,950
open source projects versus my job

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:06,510
versus my family and it's something I

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,390
work on every day to try to get better

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,130
at so you have to work hard you have to

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,100
play hard you have to live your life and

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,590
don't burn out okay it's a real problem

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,240
it's happening a lot in Silicon Valley

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,100
there has been or there have been a rash

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,169
of suicides over the last five years in

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,570
Silicon Valley by technical

00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:25,950
professionals people I knew people I did

00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,870
conferences with people I've done

00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,850
classes with who are committing suicide

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,710
because they're burning out at work and

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,970
they feel overwhelmed by all the

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,830
responsibilities they have because they

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,510
take on too much and they can't handle

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,340
it you know they take on a project

00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,110
leader position an open source project

00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,899
they're trying to work a 40-hour a week

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,330
job they got a you know a spouse and kid

00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:49,110
at home and they just can't manage it

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:50,760
all it's too much and it causes burnout

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,470
and burnouts a real problem and there

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,840
was actually an excellent talk

00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,059
here at this conference this year about

00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,700
work burnout feel free to go watch it

00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:01,649
online because it was a really good talk

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:10,350
and it's very important that we don't

00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:13,440
let that happen to us so I it's only

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:15,299
1203 but that's the end of my

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,909
