	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
In this talk, I will do a crash course in Python deep learning (DL). We will cover tabular (csv, spreadsheet), image, and forecasting DL. The key take away I want to give you is an idea on what tools are out there, and where you might look to accomplish some goal using DL. I will quickly cover tools like Tensorboard, Jupyter, Matplotlib, and Pycharm for visuals. I will be using Pytorch, and explain the difference between that and Tensorflow.
