yeah but that's a yeah I can't poke down

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:15,139
like that though dad any yeah if I turn

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,139
this way no one's gonna hear anything

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:32,279
yeah my chin how's that no yes no maybe

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:37,350
okay so oh all the slides are available

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,640
on github they're under my account but

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,020
I'm going to do introductions and

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,129
chitchat when we start installing our

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,629
first VM because we kind of have

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,670
downtime as we're waiting for things to

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,920
happen so I'm gonna let that let that

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,180
happen then so needless to say I'm not

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,230
gonna plow into this without saying Who

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,710
I am just gonna say it a little bit

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,050
later so what's required I'm also going

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,280
to talk about sort of the overview of it

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,710
during one of those down times as well

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,710
so what do we need to set this up we

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,989
need a downloaded ISO file of the distro

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,960
you want to use in your lab for this

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,540
example we're using a Red Hat variant so

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,200
either Red Hat CentOS scientific or one

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,420
of the Red Hat based distributions you

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,250
need a host computer that already has

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,250
your virtualization software installed

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,090
we're gonna use fedora for the hosts

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,100
because I have Fedora on my laptop and

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,750
we're going to use KVM for our

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,939
virtualization software because it's

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,390
built in its convenience it'll also make

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,560
some of these steps a little bit easier

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,320
you could use CentOS would look almost

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,750
identical to this you could use a

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,310
different computer for your hosts if you

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,840
wanted to you could use something like a

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,180
Windows host with hyper-v or VMware or a

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,070
Mac with VMware or whatever other

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,360
virtualization stuff you have but the

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,950
implementation details are going to be

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,649
different in how you set up your lab and

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,990
I can't cover all of those in one talk

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,430
but if you're more familiar with VMware

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,369
I don't think any of the stuff we're

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,979
doing here would seem very out of line

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,750
it should be pretty easy to adapt that

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,700
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,700
we're going to create a VM to be our

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,930
local software repository so here the

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,310
steps are going to go through we're

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,069
going to start vert man

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,910
we're gonna select a new VM we're gonna

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,280
do local install media press forward use

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,150
ISO image and then you browse your local

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,640
directories for that and then we select

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,240
the ISO image that we've previously

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,070
downloaded so let me get to that okay I

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,380
cheated a little I click the icon all

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,440
ready to start verb manager so I'm gonna

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,690
do a new VM we're gonna do local install

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,040
media is that all readable enough it's a

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,930
little bit small okay and like I say

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,880
there are some snapshots if you go on

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,950
the github the slides I have online I do

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,150
have some snapshots in there I don't

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,980
have them in this because I'm actually

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,860
doing it live but there are some snap

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,800
there's some screenshots of some of

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,860
these steps particularly this one so we

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,850
are going to choose our media will do

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,250
browse and then browse local here's our

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,480
ISO image you might be saying wow why

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,650
using just an old version I'm going to

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,650
explain that in a few minutes okay

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,709
the standard memory and one CPU is fine

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,209
we're gonna give it a little more disk

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:29,130
space in case you have a larger ISO if

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,630
you did something like download the if

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,070
you downloaded the everything CD you

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,260
need add the DVD you need a little more

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,060
space and I'm just calling an AAA repo

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,760
to put it at the top of our list to make

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,180
it easier to find so that's gonna

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:50,640
install let's not test we don't spend

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:53,329
time doing that so we'll give this a

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,329
minute or two

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,650
okay so oh I already went through these

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,180
steps

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,069
choose your memory and CPU options one

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,810
gig one CPU is fine for the disk image

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,670
give it a little more than 10 if you

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,500
have a small ISO like this I could

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,480
actually have left it a 10 gigs but give

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,330
it a little bit more and then name the

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,489
VM now we're going to install CentOS 7

00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,419
the steps are pretty easy you install

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,850
CentOS 7 select your language select

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:24,020
your installation destination let it go

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,540
with the defaults with all of that

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,070
there's no reason to change any of that

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,970
and then we'll get to a few steps that

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,130
are different we're gonna select

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,960
infrastructure server make sure we

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,700
select FTP server and make sure we

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,500
select our network to make life easier

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:44,150
for later so language English unless you

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,650
want otherwise here's where the

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,210
partitioning some people complain about

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,470
the partition err in here all we're

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,080
gonna do is we're gonna select done

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,130
because it already picked our device

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,710
correctly because there's only one

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,300
available but we'll let it automatically

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,650
do that here are some of the key

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,620
sections when we get to software

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,610
selection we want for this to be an FTP

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,010
server so we're gonna select

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,710
infrastructure server and then select

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,060
FTP server that's all really small and I

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,110
can't do anything about that right now

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,000
sorry about that

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,010
so what we're doing is this is also

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,410
selected on those the slides that are

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,750
online so I've selected on our base

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,390
environment I've selected infrastructure

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,789
server and then for the add-ons I've

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,960
selected FTP server those are the two

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:29,630
things we need for this and one other

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,710
thing to make your life easier turn on

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,840
the networking by default

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,770
trust me this can be fixed later but

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,020
it's pain-in-the-neck so we're gonna let

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,200
that install so we've got two steps we

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,580
can do here let me go back and catch up

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,950
at the slides network and hostname

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:52,700
beginning we can do our root and user

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:54,260
account and so for our lab I would do

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,510
something simple for your password and

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,820
let it complain about it being weak so I

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,919
did password password and create a user

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,990
so we don't have problems like we saw

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:08,240
some with some other ones the same

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,160
password so

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,030
now this is gonna chug away for a few

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:19,599
minutes you probably can't read the

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:21,979
numbers it's on 77 of 480 already so

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,330
we've got a couple minutes so now let's

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,590
do some introduction stuff since we have

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,340
to wait a few minutes for that VM to

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,110
install anyway so I'm Bob Murphy uh I've

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,419
been a Linux user since back in the

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,060
Slackware days like the late 90s like 96

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,919
97 currently I'm working as a Linux

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,069
system in for the last few years I'm

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,229
currently working on my rhce and not

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,690
coincidentally the way this lab is set

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:47,090
up is very tuned to what the

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,340
requirements are for that so this is

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,810
sort of if you're wondering why is he

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,580
setting up a lab in this manner why is

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,139
he using Red Hat for this this is why

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,060
I'm doing that could you do it with

00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,300
other distros yes I don't have all the

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,870
details on all of those them my contact

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,159
information is there and I'll put the

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,860
when we get some downtime later I'll put

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:10,159
the slide back up for the github page

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,080
but if you go to a github slash Murph

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:16,210
and J I only have a couple things in

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:21,530
there so if you find our lab Hou our lab

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:26,840
that's where you'll find the slides so

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:28,669
let's see okay it's getting close so

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,159
that'll go for just a couple minutes I

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,539
also wanted to thank the South East

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,870
Linux fest people they always put on a

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:39,380
good production here they have awesome

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,750
AV stuff and and thank all of you for

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,659
coming out here you know it's uh it's

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,180
early on Sunday and it's a little tough

00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,530
to drag out here but you know I

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,880
appreciate you guys taking the effort in

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,800
coming out yeah yeah thank you for

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,680
neglecting your families and coming here

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:04,580
and doing this so we've got a few

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:07,219
minutes of post installation tasks okay

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,449
so what we're going to do next so that's

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,349
going to finish in the background that's

00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:12,680
going to take another minute or two

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:14,900
we're gonna reboot and we're gonna log

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,479
in to the repo server and these are the

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,979
steps we're gonna do to set up our FTP

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,889
server we're going to start and enable

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:25,069
the FTP service through system D we're

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:29,479
open the firewall port for FTP to get

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:31,219
through and then we're gonna make that

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,250
change permanent then we're gonna copy

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,930
the files from the ISO that we just have

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,310
we're gonna mount that I so back to the

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:41,779
VM we're gonna copy all the files

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:44,450
locally to the repo server and then

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,360
we're gonna create a file to tell that

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,790
computer so our repo are our first VM

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,620
our repo VM we're gonna tell it to get

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:56,149
all its updates from its own FTP server

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,660
okay so that way if you want to install

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,070
a new package it picks it up from itself

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,350
from the files that are available on the

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,760
ISO and I'm gonna explain why that's an

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,260
interesting thing when we have downtime

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,980
while we're waiting for things to copy

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:14,329
that should be almost done post

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,040
installation setup tasks sorry this is

00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,690
part of why this takes an hour because

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,399
there are a few you know as we're

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,810
installing vm's it takes a little while

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:38,079
any questions for what we've done so far

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:41,360
yes yes absolutely in fact all of this

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,839
none of this is being done remotely this

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,610
is all being done on this laptop so and

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,860
something I don't really talk about in

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,970
here but I really probably should since

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,860
we have a minute or two I'll talk about

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,149
it now you don't need a whole lot of

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,459
power like if you were studying for the

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,740
RH CSA or the RH see you don't need a

00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,120
ton of power I picked up a laptop with

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,480
16 gigs of ram because I wanted more

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:07,760
stuff to play with an i7 I have done

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,519
these sort of labs on a reflashed

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,980
Chromebook with a Celeron dual core

00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,600
processor and 4 gigs of ram 4 gigs of

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,660
ram I think is sort of the bare minimum

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,300
but a dual core Celeron that was a

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,670
Chromebook reflashed into Linux running

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,290
Fedora doing the same thing it takes

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,170
longer I would actually show it off with

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,640
this ok we could finally reboot I would

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,959
show it off with this but it makes all

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,360
of these steps take longer like those

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,709
post installation steps take forever on

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,660
that thing because it doesn't have a lot

00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:37,430
of lot of horsepower

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,260
so I don't subject you to that because

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,790
that would make this take even longer so

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,010
when you say can you do it on your

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,500
desktop absolutely I find the real

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,630
limiting thing as RAM for gigs is your

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,960
absolute minimum to run a couple of VMs

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:52,640
eight is much more comfortable and the

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,740
more the merrier you know it makes it

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,620
much easier but to do this stuff here

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,610
and this is our route and password

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,230
unfortunately you know what let me get

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,750
this let me s to see let me see if I can

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,400
ask this H into this and make that

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:26,290
bigger I can't do anything about the

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:26,290
console that 122 oh not once one

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,590
I'm looking at the wrong number give me

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:38,770
just a second here minor technical for

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:42,100
t7 that's why like oh if I don't have

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,620
network this goes really badly okay

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,700
actually this network I don't need just

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,940
to there's no shenanigans there I need

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:57,940
no external networking for this so this

00:11:51,940 --> 00:12:01,360
I can make larger let's go down one for

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,460
this you know every time I click in that

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,290
console window I can't switch between my

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:12,010
screens which is a little bit maddening

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:17,740
so let's do some bigger bigger bigger

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:20,890
how about that okay so how's that more

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,890
readable I can even do probably get away

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,650
with one more there we go

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,150
so so now we're logged into our FTP

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,720
server this should make life a little

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:34,930
bit easier I just have to pass by that

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,310
to get to my slides so here are our

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,720
steps and again all these steps are

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,740
online you don't have to furiously write

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,770
these down we're gonna do a system

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,520
control start the SFTP D so just so you

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:49,110
know the SFTP D is the internal is the

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,920
default FTP server in a Red Hat system

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,660
we're gonna start it we're going to

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,080
enable it you could do status to see if

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,000
it's running

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,260
we'll see if we do that and then we're

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,510
going to set the firewall we're gonna do

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,150
firewall command add service FTP and

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:04,240
then do permanent so persists through a

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,400
reboot and then you have to do a reload

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,050
because that only puts it in the config

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,060
file so then we do a reload so it

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,250
reloads that config and makes that

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,390
active and then we'll get our IP address

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,850
but we already have our IP address

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:19,380
because I went into it here

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,760
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,730
hey we're gonna accidentally start

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:32,280
another shell by hitting the trackpad

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:35,779
will do system control start the SFTP D

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:39,389
will do enable

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:49,019
which will start at next reboot do

00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:52,800
firewall command permanent add service

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:55,500
equals FTP now so that wrote that to our

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,790
config we're gonna do a reload so that

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:03,510
puts that in currently we're gonna type

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:05,250
reload correctly okay they're not picky

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,480
about that that's awesome if I'd only

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,459
known I could have just rolled with that

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,519
and not not made a fuss so let's see our

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:23,220
IP address right it was 47 we're gonna

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:25,070
need that so so now we're going to do is

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:30,209
we're going to copy all the files from

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:31,560
the CD to our local repo so that they're

00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,699
all available and there might be a

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,660
question about why don't you just mount

00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,660
the CD I'll get into that in a minute

00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:47,310
okay so we need to go into details we

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,610
are going to the CD and we're going to

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:54,779
pick the very same CD that we installed

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:58,550
our operating system from we're gonna

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,550
choose that so that mounts that there

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:11,120
we're going to do make sure I'm in route

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,120
okay will do

00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:33,490
hey how come that didn't show up browse

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:40,390
read-only shareable huh bear with me for

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:42,899
a minute here what's that did I type

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,899
temp

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,420
yeah they saying the device doesn't

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,420
exist

00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:02,079
hmm let me add mount that and remount it

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:14,700
and see if that works better the demo

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:14,700
gods are being cruel today let no media

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,680
let's see that's the right one

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,960
of course I've only done this like four

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,330
times in the last couple days and ever

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,120
this has never been a problem oh you

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,040
know what if one hits the apply button I

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,050
bet it's gonna work there it goes

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,730
okay you have to hit the apply button by

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:51,340
the way after you do that news to me

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,720
now let me refresh my memory okay and

00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,010
I'm gonna use our sink just because it

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,510
gives us yeah I mean you could just copy

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,910
the stuff but I'm gonna use our sink

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,270
simply because it gives us some feedback

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:09,760
as to how far it's gone along what I do

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:12,670
our sink dot HP a - a B HP will go from

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,790
temp to bar here's the interesting part

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,380
- VAR f TP pub we're gonna do is we're

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,930
going to put all these files in an

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,880
easily accessible directory that the FTP

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,199
daemon already sets up that's the only

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,640
reason I use the pub directory is

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,320
because it's there all the permissions

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,050
are set right all the es in Linux stuff

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,750
is that right that all goes in nice and

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,360
easy so we'll do that now we've got a

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:38,320
couple of minutes to chat again so let's

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,820
see so why do we set up a home lab like

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,680
this you might be thinking you know you

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,300
said you're setting up a home lab why

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,520
are you doing it this way this seems a

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,920
little bit odd so it gives us a couple

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,440
things that lets us easily set up and

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,920
break down and redo new machines but

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,330
more importantly well it also gives you

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,280
stability in versions of the operating

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,380
system again when you're doing the Red

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,510
Hat test they tend to test on an older

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,910
version of Red Hat so if you have all

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,430
the newer spiffy stuff it may fix a bug

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,720
that you find in the older version so

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,760
you probably want to practice on an

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,770
older version for your VMs I mean it's

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,240
good to be you know current on what's up

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,720
to date but if you're looking for that

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,520
test

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,860
sticking with the older version is

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,180
probably a good idea now if you do a yum

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,800
update you don't accidentally get

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,800
upgraded to the latest version and stuff

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,630
changes out from under you and this is

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,490
the part this last item is the one that

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,770
was the most important one for me is you

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,080
don't need the network when you're doing

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,030
your studying so I've been in a

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,280
situation where ok I've got a couple

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,930
hours I'm sitting in a sandwich place

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,660
I've got my lunch I got like an hour and

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,240
a half you know what I'll I've got my

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,190
PDF of all of my study materials let me

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,789
do some stuff ok let's do a webserver

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,950
yum

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:53,080
stall you know httpd doesn't work why

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,940
because the network in this place

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,710
doesn't work correctly now I'm dead in

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,409
the water I can't continue with what I

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,359
want to work on because oh it's finished

00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,590
ready I can't finish you know I can't

00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,080
continue on what I want to work on

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,690
because I can't install the web server

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,450
with this when we point our VMs to this

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,450
repo we can do absolutely everything you

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,340
can do with a stock Red Hat install with

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,109
no network at all and that was part of

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,629
the reason more than anything else

00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:20,710
really that I put my machine in airplane

00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,570
mode just to show you that I'm not

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,369
pulling in any resources from that

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,570
aren't on this machine and the only

00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:27,759
thing I have on this machine that's

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,899
interesting is what I asked for in the

00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,450
beginning of the virtualization software

00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:34,330
in an ISO image that's all I need to set

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,529
all of this up to do basically all the

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,859
tasks for that certification study ok so

00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:45,399
all of our files are copied over let me

00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:47,590
not get ahead of my slides here ok so

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:49,059
now we're gonna do is now the way

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,669
Red Hat works for anyone that's not

00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:54,580
familiar is there are files called dot

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,879
repo files that tell it where to find

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,090
its updates by default it either sends

00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:02,349
you to the Red Hat site or to the CentOS

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,929
site which is actually still red head

00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:06,669
you know and send you there for your

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,619
updates what we're gonna tell it is

00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:11,409
don't go to Red Hat or don't go to

00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:14,289
CentOS for your updates go to my server

00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:16,690
here and I'm gonna do it on this one

00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:18,369
simply for simplicity I'm gonna have it

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,139
refer to its own FTP server that way I

00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:22,629
can test it out before I've gone to an

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:24,879
outside machine so here are the things

00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:26,889
we need to do we're going to go to where

00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:29,919
those repo files are which is in Etsy

00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:31,809
yum repos D and we're gonna move

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,369
everything that's in there out before we

00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,869
do an update right now you don't notice

00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,309
I haven't done a yum update you know

00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:38,019
everybody says you you install your

00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,210
server do a yum update no no we don't

00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,979
want that for this particular thing we

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,419
want to go in there take all those repo

00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:45,580
files that tell it where to get its

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,019
updates and get them out now if you're

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,849
feeling bold you can just delete them I

00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:51,099
tend to move them to the root folder

00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:52,809
just so if I wanted them later

00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:55,840
I can go retrieve them and you know do

00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:58,539
an update over the network so I move

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,200
those out and we create our own repo and

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,409
you

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,450
see I do edit I'll do vim our VI Network

00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:07,120
repo and these are the components you

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,269
need to make that work you need the name

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,580
of the repo in square brackets and then

00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,679
for redundancy sake you need name equals

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,330
network which is the name of our repo

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,190
you can name this repo whatever you want

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,679
by the way network is just arbitrarily

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,429
what I call it here's the real good part

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:28,330
here here's the punchline base URL

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:30,370
equals and then then the network and the

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,070
location of your files so in our case

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:37,080
it's gonna be FTP colon slash slash one

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:39,700
I to 168 122 dot anyone remember 47

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,340
slash pub because that's where we dumped

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,929
all our files if I did this right I'm

00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,980
gonna double check because if I put it

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,299
in a slightly different directory I

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,200
could just change that here and

00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,630
everything will work the way it's

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,610
supposed to and then we do GPG check

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,289
equals zero we know where all our files

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,179
came from we're not getting these over

00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:56,889
the network no one's gonna be hijacking

00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,559
our repo because it's all on our machine

00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:01,929
anyway so turn that off simplify things

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,669
then we're gonna save and quit and then

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,409
we're gonna test it by doing a yum clean

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:07,480
all today say take any cached

00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,360
information you had from the old servers

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,850
throw that out and then we're gonna um

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,190
install something I usually do FTP or I

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,529
do screen or something like that it

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,210
doesn't matter and you don't have to do

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,950
the last step FTP localhost if it has

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,960
gotten this far if the install works our

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,809
FTP server is working because we use it

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,250
this way now theoretically for your repo

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,019
machine you could just give it the local

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,750
directory path here but this gives us a

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:34,149
test right in the process and then we

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,820
also have the added bonus of if we want

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:39,130
to not type all this in next time when

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,480
we have a second VM we can just pluck

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,529
this file out of this put it in and

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,269
everything works you'd have to retype

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:44,740
all this stuff so that's that's the

00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:46,090
reason I do this on the local machine

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,909
when I could make it a little bit

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:51,490
simpler we make it so it's universal

00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:55,090
across all of them so let's go through

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,529
this so we'll do CD oh let's check and

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:02,409
make sure the files ended up where I

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:04,419
thought unless var FTP pub beautiful so

00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:10,940
that's all our files from the from the

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:12,920
DVD so we'll do CD Etsy yum repos D

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,960
and you see we have all the sent OS

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:21,650
files all of these files will show you

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,570
will send you to the CentOS send you to

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,990
the CentOS servers for that so let's do

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,550
CentOS base just so you see there's are

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,100
a little more complicated but it's

00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,260
basically the same thing they have a

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,600
name they have a all they have a mirror

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,000
list we're gonna use the base URL to

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,960
keep it simple they want to do GPG

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,580
checks now of course if you're

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,470
installing stuff over the network you

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,900
want to leave those GPG checks enabled

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,470
for ours we can get rid of that so let's

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:52,280
create our own so let's do move all of

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:57,230
this stuff to route and then we're gonna

00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,430
do VI Network dot repo so I'm gonna go

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,280
through the same steps I just showed you

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,100
on the other slide we're gonna do

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:08,510
Network we're gonna start insert mode

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:12,100
first Network and we do name equals

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:20,770
network what you do

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:20,770
base URL you we're gonna make typos

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:37,450
equals FTP 192 168 1 20 2.47 slash pub

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:41,720
we do GPG check equals 0 that look good

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,210
network network okay we should be okay

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,160
with that so we have set up our FTP we

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,250
we set up our FTP server we enabled it

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,440
in the firewall we turn it on and now

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,440
we've told this machine to look to its

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,860
own FTP server to make that work so

00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:05,360
let's do a yum clean all let's do a

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:09,350
stall screen will do yum install screen

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,140
just for completeness okay if it's

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,110
gotten this far boom so now we have a

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,220
working repository of the entire install

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:22,490
DVD on our local machine so we basically

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,140
got all the pieces in place now so just

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,590
to demonstrate a little bit more I'm

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,630
going

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,190
to install another VM and instead of

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,200
installing it from the CD like I did

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,880
before I'm going to install it from this

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,710
repository I'm gonna do a network boot

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,390
from this repository and get all the

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,610
files from here now

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,470
mind you it's not quite smart enough to

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,990
tell it to use this as a repo even if I

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,500
install it from here but it'll prove

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:51,500
that everything works correctly so let's

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,870
go back here let's create another new

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,190
one now this is the one part where if

00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,260
you're doing this on VMware you're doing

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,820
this on hyper-v I don't think you get

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,470
this option in here because this

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,690
basically does like a fake pixie boot

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,820
within it and boots off of the CD from

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,919
our repo I don't think you can do that

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,990
very easily from those this does some of

00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,059
those steps for you so we're gonna do a

00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,700
network install important this is the

00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:16,299
part I can't really enlarge let's go

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:21,950
forward so we're gonna do for our URL

00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:23,529
FTP one I to one succeed 122 I'm gonna

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:31,970
put dots between things and everything

00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:36,950
Pub do do it to do why is it taking so

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:38,870
long let's see ah if you can see here it

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,270
says CentOS 7 which tells me it's

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,880
working doing a live demo it's very

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,260
happy for me to see that it actually

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,179
picked that up because it took a little

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,320
while so now we can go with the defaults

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:56,870
for this you can even cut it down a

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:58,940
little let's do that so it takes a very

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,950
little amount more to do that see now

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,289
it's booting it's doing a pixie boot and

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,270
it's what it's pointing it at our repo

00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,000
it's gotten this far it's probably gonna

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,140
work

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,149
give me a graphical screen and then I

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,149
can relax a little bit here

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,720
that looks good come on all right so so

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,149
we've done a successful boot from our

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,499
local repo so we do some of the same

00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,989
steps obviously we don't need to setup

00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:38,960
this up as an FTP server we're gonna do

00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:40,249
the installation destination

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,509
oddly network since we're installing

00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:43,820
over the network you know have to bother

00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,610
with that this time and we'll let it

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,649
stay at minimal I'm just gonna do a root

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:53,570
password I'm not even gonna bother with

00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:55,070
the user on this one and then we have a

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,799
couple minutes so let me go back to the

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:01,159
slides so there we go so that's our

00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,899
second vm and we're pulling the

00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,489
information directly from the first vm

00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:09,529
oh I got completely ahead of all of my

00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:11,419
slides here so I just did all these

00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:14,119
steps once this virtual machine manager

00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:15,590
select a new VM but instead of a local

00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:19,009
CD install we're doing it from the

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:21,859
network for the URL we type in our FTP

00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:24,320
site then we've set up memory CPUs and

00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,909
just a taste and now we have time for a

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,340
few questions oh okay

00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:33,710
that we don't do yet any questions so

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,249
far it's early everyone was drinking

00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,940
last night

00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:44,470
it's done silence no so this keeps all

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:48,169
of your stuff nice and local all of your

00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:50,779
all of your versions stay coherent

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,820
because if you do something like update

00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:54,379
the system so so if you do something

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,999
like you have it live you update the

00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:58,340
system and then you pull in the RPMs off

00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:00,440
the CD to do that theoretical web

00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,629
install your versions are off because

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,759
the CD is behind what you pulled off the

00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:07,609
network it's very convenient to keep all

00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,230
this stuff here and being able to

00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:10,940
connect when we set up that repo file

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,350
you know yeah I can't talk too much

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,419
because there's NDA's on the test stuff

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:17,080
but that's a handy skill to have by the

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:23,239
way where I set up that network repo

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:24,889
just a hint you may see that uh let's

00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:28,059
see this doesn't need to be in front

00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,059
anymore let's see

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:37,810
okay so we've got our yeah it's already

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,980
into post installation tasks this is the

00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,050
part when it does the post installation

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,820
tasks that takes forever when it's

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,320
setting up the the kernel ending that

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,600
Ram FS and all that stuff on that

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,100
Celeron machine I was talking about took

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,060
forever cuz I was gonna bring that one

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,710
because it's smaller and lighter

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,300
would've been convenient I did know

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,010
instead of taking five minutes takes

00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:58,750
like twelve minutes and I can't even I

00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:00,100
can't talk for that long KVM because

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:04,330
it's all built in like I say if you

00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,950
install a CentOS or a fedora or a Red

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,240
Hat system you have everything you need

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,240
on that system

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:23,410
sure and you can do that but these are

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,750
useful skills to have yeah yeah yeah

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,640
yeah you could certainly clone your VMs

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,620
off of that but having the repo so that

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,630
everything stays local is still still

00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,730
valuable so making you so creating your

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,160
new VMs on this is not necessarily the

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,840
fastest way to do this and having

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,840
snapshots and being able to rollback is

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,700
valuable as well but it is good to have

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,130
this local repos so that way even if you

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,570
do say you want to tear down and build

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,270
up fast so you're just gonna clone off

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,280
VMs that's fine but having this repo

00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,960
setup here means you can install new

00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,160
software into those you know you don't

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,460
want to start from a machine with

00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,680
everything installed because then if you

00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,450
you know if you run into a problem you

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,980
don't know what packages you need to

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,860
make that happen you want to practice

00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,350
from a base old you know not necessarily

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,330
old but a base minimal install and

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,000
install the packages you need to get the

00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:15,900
tasks done so that way you know what

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,020
packages you need to get the tasks done

00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,130
to do so let's see almost done and then

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,830
what we're gonna do is we're gonna pull

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,840
that repo file off of the other machine

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,620
and you'll see that we'll be able to use

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:33,490
from this new VM we'll be able to pull

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:36,510
stuff off the the V at the our original

00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,510
repo VM

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:47,930
what's that what do you mean like which

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:51,110
book or the the sander van route books

00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:53,270
seemed good to me the Jiang stuff I was

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:57,710
using supplemental supplementally as

00:31:53,270 --> 00:32:00,200
well I read through the as God gory book

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,030
I found it really hard to follow that

00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,790
was like reading stereo instructions to

00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:08,350
me I might this is that that one seemed

00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:10,820
the the definitively worst of the three

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:14,120
where the Jiang the sander book and the

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:17,570
Jiang book seemed seemed better for what

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:21,110
I was doing okay so we're done we're

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:25,340
gonna reboot oh I got to do another SSH

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:30,940
session let's see ah I have to get the

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,940
IPA that one first give me just a minute

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:41,450
he's put up pretty quick when they're on

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:42,680
minimal let's see don't worry about

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,840
seeing what's on this screen I'm gonna

00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,840
blast over to the other one 129

00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:08,840
okay so here we are we have a another

00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:11,750
working VM we're gonna do CD Etsy yum

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,540
that repos D we're gonna do a move we're

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,860
gonna get everything out of here and

00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,110
then instead of redoing that file from

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:22,810
scratch which I can do we're going to do

00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,810
an SCP from on

00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,340
well they problem with SCP is I don't

00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,200
get command completion so I can't cheat

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,090
and make sure I have all my things right

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,270
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:50,270
I'm gonna do a remote copy from 47 which

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,820
is our repo machine the Etsy yum repos D

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,230
directory the network dot repo file and

00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:00,560
I'm going to copy it to our current

00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:02,180
location and it worked so now we're

00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,380
gonna do the same test we did before

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,890
we're gonna clean make sure there's

00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,659
nothing in the in the cache and then

00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:12,860
we're gonna install the program from our

00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:20,649
repo so we'll do yum clean all and then

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:24,530
we're yum its install ha ha look at that

00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:26,720
so now all of this stuff is pulling from

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,450
this is a separate VM and it's pulling

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,050
all of its update material off of our

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:35,690
original VM so now if you have this all

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,880
set up now I could sit anywhere do

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:42,530
everything in either the either any of

00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:44,179
those rhce or HRH CSA books with exactly

00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,470
what I have here I need no network

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,630
connection I need nothing from the

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,840
outside of course it's nice to be able

00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:52,640
to Google stuff but I'm not dependent on

00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,230
anything from the outside to be able to

00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,490
do stuff on this now I'm talking about

00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,500
studying for now but you could do stuff

00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,690
like if you want to test web servers if

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,670
you want to you know install stuff

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,800
everything is there but it's just what's

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,830
in the reddit repos if you want to go

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,680
outside of that obviously gonna need

00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:11,090
something additional so we did all of

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,220
that time for questions

00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,440
oh ok you know I'm a step ahead of my

00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:19,100
slides each time here so there's our

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,940
repo I did the SCP root at blah blah

00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,670
blah to r.i.p yum repos d network repo I

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,900
did a an explicit path because I didn't

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,060
know where I was starting from there but

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,340
that did the same step we just did or

00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,010
you could recreate it from scratch with

00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,790
those four lines and it works

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,320
successfully so now we have our complete

00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,910
like I say home lab yeah some people

00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,590
want more out of this I actually posted

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,630
some information on this up on reddit

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,220
people's I know I've got 18 different

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,290
operating systems and for servers I'm

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,610
like yeah ok I can't do that in an hour

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,670
though this is this is

00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,870
one presentation for one thing here

00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:56,420
focus towards this so if you're studying

00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,320
for the redhead exams or Linux plus or

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,870
any of these things you've got

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,730
everything you need right there and

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,410
everything works so if you want these

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,210
slides and like I say if you get the

00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,640
what looks like the latest version of

00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,430
the slides the one that's a seven P that

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,110
has some screenshots in there as well so

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,360
it'll have a couple of spots that I

00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,280
thought it might be beneficial to have

00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,630
them but I don't have them in this one

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,190
because I'm obviously doing everything

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm showing you everything that would be

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,140
in those screenshots and there's some

00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,520
older versions of it in there as well if

00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,680
you want to get ahold of me if you have

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,790
questions outside of this MuRF it member

00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,190
dot s fsf.org or I'm on the feta verse

00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,800
at Murph at fostered on org

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:42,530
that's Mastodon and plural ma and that

00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,880
whole wonderful ecosystem of interesting

00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:48,410
things I'd encourage you to take a look

00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:53,090
at and other than that I am more than

00:36:48,410 --> 00:37:03,050
happy to answer questions okay I'm going

00:36:53,090 --> 00:37:05,300
to start with you I'm in a largely red

00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,470
hat based environment and it would be

00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,060
useful and I think it's still a valid

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,430
still a valid certification they've

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,540
actually just announced changes to it so

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:18,170
it's going to be more answerable based

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:21,530
so it's gonna be a little more DevOps II

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,360
for the the for the sieep or ssin of it

00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,530
if you care to go day yeah I've sort of

00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,850
been looking at the material saying this

00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,320
feels dated you know you're sending up

00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,750
web servers you're setting up mail

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,190
servers you know that's a little less

00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,140
relevant today I think they're making it

00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,080
more relevant and the fact that it's a

00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,790
live exam where you sit down in a room

00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,040
and you have a server and they say here

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,600
it is it's you can log in you've got

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,250
some problems you need to fix these

00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,290
things you know here's a list of stuff

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:49,040
you need to do that takes it beyond the

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:51,620
usual you know memorize regurgitate you

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,570
know multiple choice type of thing it's

00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,490
considerably harder so I think it shows

00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,840
a higher degree of competency but that's

00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:00,710
just my opinion I don't hire people

00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,050
either so yeah that that's why I'm still

00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:12,440
pursuing it so

00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:17,120
yes yes I don't have that every what you

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,310
would do is no actually it isn't because

00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,840
I've gone through it I failed at once so

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,400
I have a pretty good idea of what's

00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,070
what's in a lot of it although they have

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,110
different versions of it you can what

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,460
you can do is there's a program and I

00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:31,520
don't recall the name of it

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,320
it's like young download-only I think so

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,850
what you could do is say say we were on

00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,460
our repo I'm not gonna demonstrate it

00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,360
because I don't know if it's gonna work

00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,460
especially since I have the network

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,440
turned off you could do that you could

00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,300
download all the packages put them in

00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,550
the folder like in our pub folder in

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,720
packages just to keep life saying you

00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,530
put them where all the other packages

00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,240
are and then you run a repo gen repo

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,070
generator generate repo there's a

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,900
program to do that so you could take any

00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,910
collection of files and make it into a

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,410
repo we don't have to go through that

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,290
because we copied all the files from the

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:06,290
CD so those index files come along with

00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,610
it so our repo is exactly what's on the

00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,770
CD that's why I don't pick and choose

00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,390
because it keeps it nice and neat

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,860
we're just copying everything from the

00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,050
CD oh and you reminded me I got a point

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,610
I got to bring up so we pull everything

00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,860
in from the CD we have that index file

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,270
already if you wanted to make a custom

00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,220
repo with just your packages in the

00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,350
dependencies that you need for it you

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,080
can create your own repo outside of that

00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:28,850
but that means you could download a full

00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,070
list of packages from Red Hat get all

00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:34,130
the updated packages run that create

00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,420
repo command and then point either put

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,880
it where you have these or you could

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,220
point it to a new repo for that and you

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,810
could have updated packages I don't do

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,490
that as part of this but it's certainly

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,900
a feasible thing to do let me mention

00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,610
one thing before I get your question I'm

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,650
not gonna forget about you though so I

00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,750
got a I got I got feedback from reddit

00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,580
cuz you know they're gentle and they

00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,490
said why don't you just leave the CD

00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:59,420
mounted to your repo and do that were

00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,680
you gonna ask that too okay okay

00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,850
they said why don't you just leave the

00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,310
CD there that way you don't have to

00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,480
allocate space to it I try I'm thinking

00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,670
the back of my head why didn't I do that

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,830
I tried that there's SELinux problems

00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,330
with that SELinux you can't change the

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,880
context of it because it's a read-only

00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:15,740
file system now if there's a way around

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,700
that that's great I don't know what that

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,089
is now so I went

00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:23,329
with this because it works if you can

00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:25,070
change those SELinux context on that iso

00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:27,530
file i guess you can make that work and

00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:29,210
of course for those of you that say well

00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,400
just turn su linux off like everybody

00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:34,040
else does you can't do if you're doing

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:43,490
rhce you need to have SELinux on at the

00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:44,690
end otherwise you fail so yeah yeah I

00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,640
don't run into a lot of problems with it

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,320
either but turning it off or putting it

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,270
in permissive mode is not the right

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,440
solution to this problem maybe it's the

00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,329
right solution to your problem not the

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,530
right solution to this problem okay now

00:40:53,329 --> 00:41:03,760
that's your guy I didn't want to forget

00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:03,760
the BCD thing yes

00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,200
you

00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,700
that's a good question maybe you could

00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:25,370
maybe you could replace those repo files

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,340
on there no one has ever asked that now

00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,780
I'm sort of interested to try although

00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,790
it's good to know how to create that

00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,230
file like yeah and in the in the short

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,930
run it would be cool to dump that in so

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,180
that way you don't have to do it helpful

00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,940
him know how to make that file like if

00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:44,990
you forget how to do that you might run

00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:47,960
into problems if I can be ever so subtle

00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:51,770
about what's required there it's good to

00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:56,810
know how to do that okay more quite yes

00:41:51,770 --> 00:42:00,260
sir yeah

00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,790
oh yeah I would definitely do rel eight

00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,790
now cuz that's where things will be

00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,960
going and they're very long-lived I

00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,550
started this train on I started this

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,760
train on RedHat six I've switched over

00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,280
to seven and I'm not switching I'm

00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,610
probably gonna take the test in November

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,310
ish so I'm not gonna switch to eight and

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,380
yeah if I were doing this anew after you

00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:26,150
take the rhce which has stayed the same

00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:29,060
rh sa yes sorry I'm getting my mi

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,980
acronym doubt the sa is that is pretty

00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,270
much the same for the CEO I'd look into

00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,300
that newer one that does Red Hat a

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:41,060
danceable and all that stuff so question

00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:45,050
oh okay sorry sorry just trying to be

00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:46,550
attentive okay I'm happy to answer a

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,050
question about earlier on we've we've

00:42:46,550 --> 00:43:04,670
gotten through all the materials so I'm

00:42:48,050 --> 00:43:07,040
more than happy to answer yeah yeah that

00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,560
was sort of like your question you could

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,080
but for our purposes we explicitly don't

00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,080
want to do that because we want to keep

00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,550
all of the versions the same and stay on

00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,930
the version that we started with so

00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,930
that's sort of the reason to do this

00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,580
could you do that yeah that the answer

00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,290
is similar to what he was asking as far

00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,150
as like doing the you pull down the

00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,950
packages and you put it you know and you

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,350
could script all it as put in a cron job

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,100
or something pull down the new packages

00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,740
with yum

00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,390
download-only put them in there run the

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,590
create repo command and it would keep

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,630
that up to date so you could certainly

00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,160
do that sort of thing and I believe

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,350
that'll work although I don't haven't

00:43:40,160 --> 00:44:09,400
really tried it all the tools are there

00:43:42,350 --> 00:44:09,400
to do it right yeah yeah right yeah

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,720
gotcha

00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,360
yeah well you saw how quickly install

00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:30,040
packages and stuff you know that was

00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,040
yeah I'm pretty sure you can do that

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:35,990
yeah but you could yeah you could you

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,940
could mirror that online repo and then

00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,590
do your create repo so that way you have

00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,660
those index files so the defined stuff

00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:46,030
correctly yeah I don't see any reason

00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,030
you couldn't do that that should work

00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,360
yeah yeah if you're trying if your

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,950
purpose is to keep current that would be

00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,220
an excellent way to do it and that's

00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:57,200
sort of doing a zero budget satellite

00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,640
slash spacewalk kind of thing you're

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,650
sort of saying just just keeping the

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,480
repos and I'll update my own machines

00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:06,680
from there you know it's less management

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:11,840
but it keeps all your files local any

00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:13,520
other questions no nothing else okay

00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,410
well thank you very much I'm under time

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,940
again I'm doing these you know I have to

00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,830
apologize I was raised by New Yorker so

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,750
I speak very quickly and I go through

00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,930
this stuff faster and faster each time

00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,930
as I get more oh one more questions

00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,930
sure

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:50,850
yeah yeah that that would be an

00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,400
excellent way for you to be able to spin

00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,900
up a VM or a or a physical as long as

00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,780
your repo machine isn't the one that

00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:02,400
gets hosed you could you could spin up

00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:04,500
either even a physical host or a VM and

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,670
pull all of your files locally that's

00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:11,610
certainly a way to go about it

00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:14,920
any other questions okay thank you very

00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:17,480
much and I appreciate your time

00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,780
[Applause]

00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,780
leave that up

00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,250
you
