This talk will cover the basics of the open source project called Cloud Foundry, which is system that allows Developers to create applications quickly and easily in a Cloud Native way, while at the same time allows Operations folks to administer, deploy and scale applications to the Cloud.  We will not assume that you know anything about DevOps in this talk; this the 099 class you were looking for.  Time permitting we will also take a quick look at Kubernetes and the power behind the new Operating System for the Cloud.  And take a look at how Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes can work together.
