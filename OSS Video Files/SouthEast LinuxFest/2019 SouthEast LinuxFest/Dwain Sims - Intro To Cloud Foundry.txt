Title: Dwain Sims - Intro To Cloud Foundry
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
This talk will cover the basics of the open source project called Cloud Foundry, which is system that allows Developers to create applications quickly and easily in a Cloud Native way, while at the same time allows Operations folks to administer, deploy and scale applications to the Cloud.  We will not assume that you know anything about DevOps in this talk; this the 099 class you were looking for.  Time permitting we will also take a quick look at Kubernetes and the power behind the new Operating System for the Cloud.  And take a look at how Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes can work together.

if you're a really experienced DevOps

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:25,040
guy from Adobe and work you see this is

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,549
really kind of an intro there's a whole

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,400
process how it works give you a

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,990
challenge in the end I came up to go up

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,509
once more on your honor

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,260
tastes tactical so I can only give you a

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,800
little bit of taste of this

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,240
[Music]

00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,410
really are interested there's some way

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,890
she's done a lot about a puzzle dude was

00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:54,410
going to jump into my hand over Zuko so

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,410
we're going to kind of injured boundary

00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:02,010
use it and we'll do this mentally demo

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,250
as I can do here far run out of time so

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:09,590
I think I've got a 74 here to cover us

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,820
and I'll show you some resources and

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,060
then you can get a copy of this

00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,570
presentation by the video topic it's 74

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,880
slides but I'm gonna use like the 6-2

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,800
morning about that yourself but if one

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,260
of those three blocks of the learning

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,330
process yourself I've got slides in

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,400
there that will actually do the process

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,580
and as you can do more all this on your

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,940
own

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,160
let's try it yourself and learning the

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,440
world so that's what exact thats kind of

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,670
those as the challenge at the end so

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:51,989
don't be scared by the 74 slides pretty

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:55,580
much working in this industry for quite

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,250
a while 16 years in Silicon Valley and

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,140
I've lived in Raleigh since 2000 working

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,070
for various companies over percent like

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,739
while I work for chemical steel high

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,570
technology space we count forwarded a

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,549
lot of its operations down I tell me of

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,110
San that's no word for them for quite a

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,900
while I was at work soon

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,410
and Western Western Digital but I do

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,880
pursue says in March of last year - dude

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,460
I've never said very interesting stuff

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,280
working with us I partners which I've

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,660
never done before is really interesting

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,530
and fun learning experience I mean

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:40,710
that's kind of so why would they call

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,600
this thing boundary because if so this

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,550
is a open source project must start with

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:52,230
idea where a few years ago foundation

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,290
now he's got a lot of a lot of very

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,200
large pointy twos but the guy behind

00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:01,320
foundry is what you do is you take raw

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:06,060
materials the basic so raw materials in

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,190
this case are put this into the process

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,740
and it turns out trends and annexation

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,450
regardless running in the cloud and

00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:18,330
that's the that's the basics for how

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,570
long so it's a very nice process thank

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,410
you

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,950
I was working Susa for probably seven or

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,840
eight I'm hearing a lot about boundary

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:41,960
we actually have a compounder

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:45,210
distribution ourselves that's kind of

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,650
we're all excited like Jim that's kind

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:53,640
of what I want to relate to use some of

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:55,890
the excitement that you might get big

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,720
premise behind all this is there's a

00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,300
wall between the demo right two dead

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,540
people in the hospital the Deaf folks

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,790
are trying to write code

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,290
I changes they need to make to think

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,960
that we were all within a box guys there

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,730
is really a wall between us and what

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,550
we're trying to do is make this easier

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,440
for the whole process you know and

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,690
trying to make it so much easier for the

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,060
devs to be able to get out there an

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,040
issue they might have and to jump into

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,650
themselves that's the nice thing about

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,900
this when you actually in to set up a

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,910
cloud foundry oh they can go and

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:38,270
actually deploying their applications

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:40,160
themselves especially the staging

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,780
environments they can hand it to the

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,210
office guys is going to actually just

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,250
take push it all the way out but the

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:51,140
whole pipeline is kept nice and clean

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:55,960
these things are called bill cops hold

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,960
accountable process really streamlines

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,760
so there's a really interesting kind of

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,740
food that this guy we're not too worried

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:16,250
as he actually is he works for our

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:18,650
competitor was pivotal early in the I

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,950
love insight into cloud foundry my

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,290
process I love is my kingdom came up

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:28,160
here's my source code run out of the

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:30,170
jobs behind you're not careful that is

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,200
really the premise behind all of this is

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:36,220
that that is so easy to do that you

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,810
don't have to paste a lot about

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,290
boundaries system actually takes care

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,630
about it goofy buttons

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,210
pouring over and we need a hard study

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,940
doing the hard stuff over and over and

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,860
over again and make a nice variety you

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:56,580
have to go with them but you actually

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:58,110
going to des cÃ´tes Kannada specify what

00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,730
they need and then when you actually

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,850
very function into the flow in our

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,470
markets all they're so worried about oh

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,890
geez did that Powerball had some done

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,110
properly is that which libraries do not

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,230
really need for that I think dispersion

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,380
of that stock exactly all that stuff

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:23,760
taken care of

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:27,570
exactly so again cloud family it's our

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,640
pulpit is look at the open source again

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,990
I won't pursue Susan doesn't do anything

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,820
of his noble story we have no

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,960
intellectual property whatsoever all the

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,760
crime your services people all the kind

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,340
of that arises I was a social go grab a

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,420
copy and take a little and then it is

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,280
500 every Isaac well so this is the

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,000
platform as-a-service kind of companies

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:57,780
to go that little take application and

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,160
pushing out so these are some of the

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,800
folks that are actually involved in

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,759
cloud foundry where those big names here

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,389
like a safe communities IBM was in there

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,770
again after that Swisscom is one of our

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,819
partners in this there's a company

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,009
called a little bit

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,520
they actually have any clown they have a

00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,770
cloud every system that you can go out

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,830
lose yourself whatever free steinem low

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,569
growl no credit card needed like your

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,969
information in you can actually get

00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,560
beginning to Cloud Foundry and actually

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,959
try all this yourself and I'll show you

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,669
how to do that later their nice thing

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,279
about this program or a tional level

00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,979
little Derrick the nice thing about this

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,649
one operational level all the works the

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:51,660
same the one that we build is a little

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:55,380
different about that my Souza's battery

00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:02,490
is a little different when called cloud

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:05,699
application processes we don't actually

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:13,050
have a color system we're talking about

00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:14,430
that we don't have it today you can go

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,620
use the evening items but then you'll

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,510
get to sing I sing same customer

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,389
experience so let's do it

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,750
he's actually using our so we have two

00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:28,170
let's talk about some of these terms so

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,510
we have here a number of different we

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,130
have this control plane totaling sort of

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,279
the whole London for the entire five

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,380
battery system it's all the nodes that

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,660
you need

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,790
actually work if you look at traditional

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:50,120
boundary systems this is pretty heaven I

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:55,640
think the smallest the traditional way

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,290
of doing it is about 12 meters to make

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:03,830
it all work so we're going to spend

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:04,970
something we're like it's pretty hefty

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,590
that mean you're gonna have to really

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,010
spend a few bucks to get that thing

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,770
running

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:16,070
that is one reason why entering into

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:18,590
cloud foundry process we have system for

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,540
solution cloud application platform

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:24,170
around our systems will talk with

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,860
kubernetes so we containerize all the

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,050
role blame all the pieces of family that

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,870
you need to run so we can find about a

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,030
third of the resources that you would

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,700
take if you're using the traditional

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:40,460
conferences there again we've got we

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,490
were rushing top of serenity Stratos

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,290
there's a system called Stratos and

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,630
we'll show you statuses little bit

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,120
statuses actually this is a web tool I'm

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,920
actually getting into five battery this

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,600
is this is one of the producers behind

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,730
contributions to the whole cloud

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,360
batteries this one actually Stratos we

00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,360
actually built this

00:11:27,580 --> 00:12:09,740
these are different bill paxton are out

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,620
there and available is ready to use and

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,050
if you actually

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,630
oh there's some working what did you

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:24,800
write to do that - there's some language

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:27,470
you want to work and say that's doesn't

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,540
work for you build your own bed pack

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,580
that's awesome over here into a mess of

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:40,370
my as well

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:44,510
you're also here uttermost traditional

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:50,060
Thai fans this time our builders that's

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:52,820
not my form does not use box we don't be

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,430
reasonable only action took from our

00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:03,860
system so we don't use it they'll be

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:06,190
actually to play the slide I put the

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,190
slide

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:20,570
look at the picture

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,140

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,080
there are there is there's work going on

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,510
to actually make that a little better

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:56,339
we also cerini we also there are part of

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:58,640
this project which you actually what

00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,640
kind of

00:16:23,730 --> 00:17:00,030
[Music]

00:16:24,900 --> 00:17:00,030
we actually yeah it's available

00:17:25,040 --> 00:18:13,980
like that it's really a process you

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:27,960
establish an account system here I'm not

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:31,220
using your password it will ask you what

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,220
stations want to be running

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,770
very

00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:46,419
I did sacrifices you into the demo gods

00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:59,169
explain so they don't know what that's

00:20:46,419 --> 00:21:01,679
gonna do to us I will as soon as I guess

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,679
I will

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:27,499
how would I avoid this web app I'm

00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:33,399
actually an oldest record this is a

00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:33,399
reason I'm actually a little this is

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,409
somebody that really improve products

00:21:51,669 --> 00:22:23,419
basically this is basically it's pretty

00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:27,879
simple and I dislike a limit that's it

00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:27,879
basically what's happening now is I just

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,090
this is actually

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:20,870
my type see we are

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,619
[Music]

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:48,120
I can say see Bill Cox loving things I

00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,570
can see here I can say see them see all

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,570
the bill

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:43,380
[Music]

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,730
doesn't matter

00:31:48,800 --> 00:32:25,430
well with this particular application so

00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,430
let me just go out

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:34,380
so let's go out and take a look and

00:32:30,270 --> 00:33:08,330
again let's go off.that Stratus and

00:32:34,380 --> 00:33:08,330
again let's go off now I should see the

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:24,390
worry too much about it basically now so

00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:31,260
we'll go ahead at the leaf down and

00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:33,360
basically down and now we have running

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:37,860
believe I've kind of cleaned up after my

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,580
still owes after myself

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,580
is that the whole new process yes sir

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,580
yeah

00:33:47,669 --> 00:34:55,240
yeah that's another thing too in this

00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:59,099
world you don't worry so much about you

00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,099
just kill it and

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,450
make sure you're in the directory where

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,470
that is

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,530
that was in the so yeah we picked up

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,749
[Music]

00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:59,530
again let's go see all right so now we

00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,530
push this new app again let's go see I

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,360
did in 30 years

00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,570
[Music]

00:38:28,269 --> 00:39:34,279
the other thing I got over and it will

00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,460
basically tell you everything in one

00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,460
thing

00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:54,240
see what's going on now

00:40:51,110 --> 00:41:01,860
let's see what's going on now well

00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:04,340
basically for getting some actually

00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,340
racked up

00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:27,119
you'll notice there that just never wear

00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:32,210
listen change we actually let you crash

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:36,390
him and I'll see if I can catch a man I

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:41,430
don't normally do that I probably got

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:52,590
fast I don't do that fast that I can

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:55,710
actually see if I trying to kid and he

00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:58,160
stayed christ-like demo has failed and I

00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,160
don't know why

00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:20,710
Oh

00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,710
[Music]

00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:44,000
he did started fun so it just took a

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:47,060
while normally normally this time I was

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,410
in a situation where I began and I don't

00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:54,620
know buddy I don't know who else is

00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:59,870
losing yeah I don't like using this is

00:42:54,620 --> 00:43:03,910
not a situation there may be other folks

00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,910
out there doing that I don't know

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,939
[Music]

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:35,250
yeah okay can't explain what's going on

00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:37,800
there not right off of that okay - I am

00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,290
the downloader and I can just write off

00:43:37,800 --> 00:44:00,800
of that but I can go up here and I can

00:43:40,290 --> 00:44:00,800
just crash ah the joys of doing

00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:23,719
and if I go back now there I should see

00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,819
I've still gotta go back here so I

00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:27,670
should see yes I've still got my wedding

00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:30,890
but I don't

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,660
okay yes yeah you can't in fact if you

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,479
go through the tutorial I will show you

00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,579
you can't in fact if you go to my

00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,599
tutorial I'll show you it'll tell you

00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,369
takes you through the whole process

00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,140
right

00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:44,650
what's that it'll take you to do that

00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,660
whole 11 so I got one of the challenges

00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,539
glass slides left so I have 15 minutes

00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,900
so let me go back to my slides here for

00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,900
a second

00:45:06,350 --> 00:46:00,650
all right so that's why I can go grab

00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:24,830
distribution point you to other certain

00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:27,120
type of certified distros and their

00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:29,790
differences really all those trends

00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:35,390
around how they work and then there's a

00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:35,390
really good type of really wide

00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:31,940
with battle and then actually ask the

00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:34,640
question say when I go to a presentation

00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,560
right don't do any of my slides at all

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,599
to get a good presentation we were

00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,640
having a conversation

00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,640

finding their star the idea they're

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:50,330
having that's true all right I get all

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:52,340
the cool stuff that you get the two days

00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,320
but then I get this really nice

00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:57,130
interface on top of it to make my

00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,130
