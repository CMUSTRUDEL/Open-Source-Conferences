checking okay

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,470
okay so let's get started thanks for

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,989
coming

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,980
this is to talk about kdenlive and just

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,599
video editing in general but

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,040
specifically for Kate in life I'm gonna

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,930
do beginner stuff as well as some

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,310
advanced stuff as more of a

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,290
demonstration of the advanced stuff that

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,980
you can do in kdenlive not necessarily a

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,629
like a like a full I'll explain one of

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,980
the main advanced stuff so I'm going to

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,099
do and also going to show you how I

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,079
speed up my production and just there's

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,110
certain tips that you can do to make it

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:22,060
easier to use Kate in life so I'm

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,549
Michael Tinnell of destination thanks

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,849
and tux digital and this talk is a guide

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:32,799
to learn the beginners to an experience

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:34,090
you say usage of kdenlive so if you for

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,470
those of you who don't know who I am as

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,510
I said I'm Michael - no and I'm one of

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,370
the hosts of destination Linux and the

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,099
creator of and host of this week in

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,840
Linux and I create various other Linux

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,900
related videos on touch digital comm

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,450
both of these podcasts use video video

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,000
based and is so I have a lot of practice

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,040
and video editing but Ben by the way you

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,750
can check out the websites by going to

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,690
Michael Tinnell comm destinations org

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,739
tux digital calm and so first of all I

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,329
want to get started by asking a couple

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,900
questions so how many of you have used

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,790
kdenlive before okay nice

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,599
how many have never use any video

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:17,200
editing okay so I'm gonna do a couple of

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,299
the of the of a kind of demonstration of

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,340
like the basics and then I'll go into

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:26,680
some more you know extra features and

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:28,810
stuff so the timeline here is is

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,300
actually going to be different because

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,220
this is the 1904 version I also have a

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,700
1812 version loaded up to show it

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:41,190
because some things in 1904 are much

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,630
better and some things make it crash so

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,699
so we're gonna I'm gonna show you what a

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,110
really cool transition thing but it

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,780
doesn't work in that you know for yet

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,210
and I didn't know that until about 20

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,120
minutes ago so that's why 1812 is up for

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,520
it but anyway so this timeline is

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,960
actually pretty it's pretty useful it's

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,010
gonna be difficult to do with one hand

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,340
but

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,530
like the best thing about this structure

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,300
is that it's super keyboard friendly the

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,210
this version is more keyboard friendly

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,920
than the last one you have basically

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,810
they're the the use to just have to

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,660
right-click you have to right-click the

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,120
context menu and choose these things now

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,220
you can specify shortcuts for each

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,950
individual thing on the context menu as

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,080
well as pretty much any effect or any

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,150
feature inside of kdenlive now so that's

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,730
one of the main reasons that 19:04 is

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,620
going to be a good you know solution as

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,160
soon as they fix those bugs of the

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,480
crashing part but for the most part I

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,660
think it's it's pretty much good to go

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,550
right now and also the new timeline

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,870
structure is really cool because if you

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,110
have a problem and you tell them about

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,790
it

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,610
depending on the severity of the problem

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,040
they will fix it pretty quickly I had a

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,110
really annoying bug a couple weeks ago

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,970
and I told him about it and then the

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,680
next day it was fixed that didn't really

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,480
help me for that particular edit because

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,870
I had to do it that day but it's still

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:07,020
pretty cool that they did it so the next

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:13,600
the next thing I wanted to talk about is

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:15,840
not on that window but I needed to fix

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,840
this

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:27,330
there we go that fixes it alright so the

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,160
next thing we talk about is some extra

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,200
differences when you use the timeline so

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,630
the previous version when you pulled a

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,580
video that had audio on it the audio

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,440
would be as attached to that video clip

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,810
and this one they don't do it that way

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,380
they actually make it where it pulls the

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,430
the audio automatically off of it and so

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,840
you can see there's two different clips

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,400
but they're actually linked together so

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,690
if you didn't want to have the audio

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,330
you'd have to unlink them and then

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,389
delete the audio piece it's not actually

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,530
that is it's not required to do this

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,540
though you can actually go into the

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,130
section over here and change the layout

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,990
back to the old way if you wanted it to

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,210
but this is the new way of doing it and

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,050
they've also redesigned the overall look

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,750
of the timeline because this this way

00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,340
the way they do the the audio thumbnails

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,080
is much better because it has better

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,229
contrast as you can see when you when

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,530
you zoom in you can get better detail of

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:21,750
what of the the Peaks and everything so

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,610
the previous version had some issues

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,900
wary sometimes you couldn't really tell

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,979
what exactly the the audio thing was

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,070
doing because sometimes it would show

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,240
you the wrong waveform it would show you

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,710
not enough of the waveform and it

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,840
wouldn't anyways kind of be that we kind

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,880
of bundled together so this is a much

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,419
better way of doing it so there are

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,370
there are differently benefits to 1904

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,950
so as soon as the thing is completely

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,100
stable it'd be great but anyway this is

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,100
a one of the tips that they that are

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,700
they improved I mean and the overall

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,530
thing that they've done as far as you

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,660
know changing functionality if you have

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,100
used kdenlive before is they change the

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,350
context menu a lot so when you

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,520
right-click a clip you used to be able

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,750
to go down to the add effect and then

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,550
just choose whatever effect you wanted

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,780
to you can't do that anymore they've

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,639
actually set it up for it's only going

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,050
to show you favorites and it's not

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,450
difficult to add a favorite but it is

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,620
kind of weird that it's a but the good

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,940
thing and a bad thing is if you were

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,710
used to doing it it's going to change

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,270
your workflow if you never did it in the

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,200
first place it was gonna save you time

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,910
because you're just going to get the

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,310
things you're going to normally use so

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,260
it depends on how much you've used it

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,120
and whether you've developed a workflow

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,249
or not

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,659
but overall I think that's a good thing

00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:43,129
to have anyway so this okay very

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:45,759
directional apparently I was just saying

00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,839
that the context menu when you have the

00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,399
you have to change you have to set up

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,709
the favorites for years for your

00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,720
workflow rather than it used to having

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,120
every effect in every composite option

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,100
in the context menu now so you can still

00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,899
have effects in composites but you have

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,069
to put them in yourself or you have to

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,370
choose to which ones you want to have

00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:06,199
access to but the next thing I want to

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,569
do is talk to kind of do like a beginner

00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:10,759
tour about the different features of it

00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,470
so the first off we're gonna use the

00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,600
Select tool which is actually the

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,699
default so the Select tool is just this

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,309
right here and that's the regular mode

00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:20,899
of being able to select clips it's not

00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,339
really that important it's more of like

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,319
the default because it's just the most

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,939
normal usage of it but there are other

00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:29,089
tools that you can change like the mode

00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:32,300
there's the razor tool and the razor

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,600
tool allows you to randomly you know cut

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,819
Clips like that then there's the spacer

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,160
tool which allows you to move clips

00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:46,120
based on the track that's not what I'm

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,809
trying to do okay based on the track and

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,459
then you can just move it around like

00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,540
that and it'll also that one of the

00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,279
reasons a spacer til is really cool

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,470
because if you pick to move certain

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,829
Clips it will move everything behind it

00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,629
as well

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,429
so it'll save you time in that sense in

00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:05,509
the same way of trying to pull it back

00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:08,209
as well but when it turns the razor tool

00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:10,790
you can completely ignore it like it

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:13,129
exists but it's super slow and not worth

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,319
it because the Select tool actually has

00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:17,990
a feature that you can do that without

00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:20,990
having to worry about it so this this

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,600
arrow thing is called the playhead now

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,879
you don't actually have to use the razor

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,319
tool to hopefully guess with your mouse

00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,389
where it is you just put it frame by

00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:32,089
frame where you want it to cut hit shift

00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:34,670
R and it cuts it we're exactly where the

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,589
playhead is so it saves a ton of time

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,319
and you skip that whole mode completely

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,269
and then there's other options where you

00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,920
can just once you have that you just

00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,680
select the clip then hit the Delete key

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,050
and you're super quick cutting

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,850
so that is the one of a good ways to

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,839
speed up your production because it

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,040
allows you to skip all that now the next

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,509
thing I want to show about the beginner

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,600
tour is the tool is that there's

00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:00,980
something about kdenlive that is not

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,050
very obvious and they don't really

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,490
promote it but it's super helpful so if

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,100
you're doing something that's really

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,019
extravagant like a lot of effects or

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,879
something and a lot of effort and then

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,889
you're drawing to play it back kdenlive

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,360
is not accelerated very well so it's not

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,269
going to give you a good like a full

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,499
preview like an accurate preview so it's

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,610
going to jitter a little bit and have

00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,420
some buffering and it's not going to

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,309
work that well so we want to do is put

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,369
where it put the playhead where you want

00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:30,079
it to start the effect hit I and then

00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:32,689
put it where you want to end and then

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,910
it's just hit oh like input output and

00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:37,189
it creates a preview zone and then when

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,769
you go to the render it'll ask you

00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:42,050
options and one of those options is the

00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,429
select the select zone or and sometimes

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,399
just like the older versus preview zone

00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:47,779
so you can just do that one piece of

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,759
part of the zone that you want and it

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,350
will allow you to render the effect test

00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,240
to see if it worked very well and then

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,829
go back to do the rest of the Edit as

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,589
saves it'll save a ton of time you want

00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:59,420
to you know at record or do a bunch of

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,589
like rendering of like a four hour thing

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,480
or whatever and it takes forever to do

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,749
it you can just do this one piece and

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,129
then go back so that saves a lot of time

00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:12,649
now another thing that I think is very

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:20,290
useful about the timeline for kdenlive

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:20,290
is the ability to remove remove space so

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,769
so you can see this part right here it's

00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:27,769
just if you want to pull one clip to the

00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,470
other you can go to the spacer tool

00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,269
which can be useful at times but also it

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,939
can be slow so you can just right-click

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,889
and then there's options here one of

00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:37,759
them is remove on active track and one

00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,220
is remove space

00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,259
if you click remove space it will pull

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,399
back the clip to where is the next snap

00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:48,470
point and then it will do the next clip

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,449
pull everything behind it and is leaving

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:55,059
its aim proportions of where it was and

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,059
you pull it with it or you could do the

00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:59,510
the right-click and choose the active

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,720
track and it will leave everything

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,190
on every other track alone so you can

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,540
choose to do this that and the weird

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,420
thing about some of the stuff in

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,519
kdenlive is that there are stuff in the

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,060
shortcuts where their labels different

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:17,839
so for example the remove space said is

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,630
remove space means to remove on the

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,459
active track whereas on the right the

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,670
context menu it means all the tracks

00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:28,160
then the other option to just do the

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:32,120
full all tracks inside of the shortcuts

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,440
says all tracks so it's a compute engine

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,329
that what you're setting is gonna be the

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,949
right one because it's we're kind of

00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,209
mislabeled I think that shouldn't a

00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,920
previous version where it used to be

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,000
used to have the same styling they just

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,510
changed the context menu

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,490
now the other one is that if you had

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,579
there's a really cool feature that for

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,990
some reason is not active by default in

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,570
kdenlive you have to go in and manually

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,300
do it there's a shortcut that allows you

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,800
to create a screenshot of the frame that

00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,779
you're looking at and it will

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,370
automatically create that clip and you

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,420
can put it in your folder or you can

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,370
make it go to your project band

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,980
automatically and they and they have the

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,420
weird labeling thing for that too so

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,459
what you say I want to put it in the

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,110
project it puts it in the folder if you

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,850
want to put it in the folder it puts it

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,899
in the project so you need to you know

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,339
pay attention to that part

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:17,810
hopefully they'll fix it pretty soon but

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,449
that's the one of the issues that I've

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,790
noticed and for that kind of thing so

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:25,310
there's lots of different benefits to

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,500
using that like as far as speeding up

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,040
but the shortcuts are the most powerful

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,089
because like you you should I mean I

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,170
don't really like the defaults of how

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:35,959
they have the shortcuts because they're

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,250
kind of awkward in some cases but once

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,220
you change them up a little bit it makes

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,269
it a lot easier so one of the things I

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,180
did want to show you is that when you

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:47,930
want to go frame by frame you do left

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,120
and right if you want to go one second

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,440
at a time you hold shift and go left and

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,139
right

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,870
but the net the most powerful one is the

00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,180
alt and left and right and that is the

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,529
clips that a snap Clips jump so you

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,760
actually go in the front end of every

00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:06,649
clip and also the preview zones so you

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,500
can do that and it saves a ton of time

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:12,170
to jump back and forth so that's one of

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,190
the best things about the navigation for

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,070
the timeline is that it makes

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,810
it's so easy to navigate through it

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,370
without having to worry about it now

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:24,380
there are some bugs here and there for

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,300
the 1904 like for example I'm not on the

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,400
screen anymore so the timeline didn't

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,560
travel with me and that's a bug that

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,060
I've seen it pops up here and there it

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,730
doesn't always happen but everyone's

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,690
watching for it does happen so you have

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:41,780
to basically scroll with your mouse will

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,310
to get to it and that's fairly

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,210
unfortunate but does it one a feature

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:49,610
you can also do is alt and then home

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,650
which I can't do with one hand so I'll

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,370
just tell you what it does

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:56,540
so Alden home will take you from the

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,200
beginning and the end of the entire

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,290
project or into also alt home all in

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,720
beginning in an end and these these the

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,330
home and in key also apply to the same

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,420
alt thing so if you're wanting to go

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,950
this way let's say you can you can

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,980
actually skip the preview zone if you

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,540
use the home and in key and it allows

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,250
you to just it basically does the same

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,380
process that the alt and the left and

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,570
right do but it's still it's still

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,980
useful at times because it's faster

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,960
either on a keyboard that doesn't have a

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,310
function key then the HOME key you have

00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,710
a dedicated thing it's easier to just

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:35,540
hit that at some times so that's the

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,010
that's some other speed up process now

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,130
there's there's things that I do that I

00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,140
can't really explain in the talk because

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,790
it requires special equipment like it

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,340
for example I have a custom keyboard

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,350
that is like a macro keyboard so I have

00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,720
really custom shortcuts that are stupid

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,370
like super alt f3 or something like that

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,110
there's no reason to do those but the

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,170
reason I have them is because it allows

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,170
me to customize everything in here to my

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,730
setup for my keyboard and also not have

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,620
to worry about any conflict with

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,319
anything else because nothing else uses

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,730
those weird shortcuts so except for

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,240
plasma has weird shortcuts but that's

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,850
not important so that this is this it

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,610
makes it possible to have really quick

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,069
modifications so I have a keyboard

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,929
that's like a small one-handed macro

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,150
keyboard so I'm just switching back and

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,569
forth between every little piece so I'll

00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,250
and

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,820
allows me to have do like the alt left

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,740
on one key so I can go super fast to do

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,600
everything so that's one of the things

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,090
that like makes my workflow super fast

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,409
is that and then I wanted to show you

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,509
some some effects as well as some ideas

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:46,159
of how I do editing and one of the

00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:49,880
things that it's super useful in editing

00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:53,149
is the guides tool now there are

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:56,000
shortcuts by default but I don't

00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:57,860
remember what they are actually because

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,789
I have a custom keyboard for it as well

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,909
and it's on the timeline yes the guides

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:09,919
here and when you add a guide what it

00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:13,519
does is puts a guide right here and this

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,169
guide will allow you to you know not

00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,240
have to have a clip there and still be

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,759
able to go use the alt and left key to

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,769
jump to that guide and that saves a ton

00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,620
of time in as well because it allows you

00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:27,080
to put like preset up what cuts you want

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,929
to do and then go in and to make the

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,940
cuts so for example when I do

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,149
destination Linux editing I have an

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,970
automation tool where I and while we

00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:40,100
reading I'll have a time stamp that I'm

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,110
well in the during the normal while I'm

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,259
editing while we're recording the show I

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,639
have the macro has a time stamp being

00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,200
recording of that time of when we

00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,389
started the recording and I hit the

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,610
button to apply a time stamp and then

00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:54,379
from there I make an automation thing

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,750
where I take the time stamp and turn it

00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:58,519
into a guide in Kaden life so when I

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,470
open Kate in live to edit destination

00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,000
Linux all of the Edit points are already

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,909
set for me because I have an automatic

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,889
set for the guides one of the cool

00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:09,080
things about the 19:04 version of the

00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:13,750
guides is that you have a lot more

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:20,809
customization which is the the 18:04 is

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:24,500
very limited though apparently this is

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,940
also a limited but in the automation

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,529
aspects of it you can choose what you

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,690
want you can choose the color of the

00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:32,629
guides you can also choose to give it

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:36,320
names so I have an automatic thing where

00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:38,750
if I make a mistake then I put myself as

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,940
the Edit point if Ryan totally screws up

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,710
like always

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,240
I put it I put a message message saying

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,570
this is where Ryan screwed up the entire

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,220
show and you have to fix it so there's

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,650
things like that that happened and I

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,840
think that the if once you get used to

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,309
the process you'll get its really quick

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,400
process it's a super fast production

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:01,610
time but it does take a while to get

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,830
used to all of the settings it's it's

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:07,340
KDE so that's what yeah you know

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,919
everybody gets that like that you're

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:15,380
you're used to the super crazy settings

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:17,539
anyway so my method is super custom and

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,909
I do have some scripts that I'm gonna

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:21,500
put on github that won't we allow you to

00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:23,450
use everything that I have but I'll show

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,490
you this just how the structure of how I

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,200
have it so that you could recreate it if

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,309
you want to but it's not like I'd be a

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,840
plug-and-play thing because you have to

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,640
have that keyboard I have you have to

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,380
have all this other stuff you also have

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,909
to have Ryan mess up your show in order

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,990
to fix it and what so the the next thing

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:47,659
I want to talk about is some effects

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:51,289
that you can do in kdenlive and this is

00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:54,860
a this is called a matte transition

00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:56,390
video now this video is apparently it

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,480
looks like it's just basically nothing

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:03,799
so it's a transparent background video

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:06,679
so what you do is you see these white

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,940
things pop up and it basically looks

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,640
like it's nothing special because it's

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,620
just this weird video playing but what

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,620
it's actually doing is this

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,290
so allows you to transition from one

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,350
video to another video with that

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,870
transition video and the transparency

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,570
effect allows you to reveal the below

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,370
video through that structure so you can

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,220
make that animation be anything you want

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,260
it to be and it allows you to basically

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,120
have any kind of transition not just a

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,550
fade not just to whatever you can make

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,050
it custom to the layout and landscape of

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,440
it like for example there's some times

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:52,950
where I saw there's a guy help do some

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,600
work with he did a video shoot on a

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,850
mountain I'm not gonna go up to that

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,110
mountain but I can make a transition so

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,180
it looks great where it kind of like

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,920
fades along the mountainside while

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,110
they're skiing and then it shows the

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,410
next scene like that's a pretty cool

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,530
effect and the way you do it is this

00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,750
process so the first clip you want to

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,400
have in thatis in the display of it you

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,800
want to use at the very bottom of the

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,530
track then you want the next clip on top

00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,780
of it and the however long the matte

00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,980
transition is that's you just have to

00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,210
deal with however long it is so you have

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,070
to know where you're gonna cut so you

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,620
have to prepare if you're gonna use

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,950
these and then you just set up a matte

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,170
transition to apply to auto and then set

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,180
that on the top of everything so it has

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,620
to go from the one you start with then

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,630
the next level you want to go to and

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,930
then the transition on top of that that

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:47,960
will compensate and then apply all its

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:50,280
magic so that's a different situation in

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,230
like a lot of people are not going to be

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,660
using but it's a really cool effect that

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,480
you can do as an advanced tool and Kate

00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,160
in life and this is the example I was

00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,700
talking about where it would crash the

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,550
new one

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,080
so I attempted to try it three times and

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,120
we're like okay it's crashing literally

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,400
every time so here's 1812 where it

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,520
doesn't crash so this is a good example

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,230
of the preview render as well so when it

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,860
starts doing it it's not gonna be able

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,600
to do it very well so it's just gonna

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,190
jitter and stuff and it you can you can

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,960
see it's happening but you're it's not a

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,400
good representation so that's why you

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,400
would use the preview render for that

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,320
and or just make a tiny video and just

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,290
put it there you could also do that if

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,150
you wanted to so I think kdenlive has a

00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,220
lot of benefits I think that it's

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,100
overall it's a great

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,350
tool to use and I think that over if you

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,789
wanted to you could customize it to do

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,020
basically anything you want except

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:47,130
render fast yeah because it's depending

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,950
on how long your video is it could be

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,450
forever like occasionally I'll have it

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,270
where the video for destination Linux

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,770
takes four or five hours and that's just

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,320
because if you do stuff like this you do

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:01,020
extra effort of extra effects it's going

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,020
to add a lot of time there is a

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,450
technically possible thing this is an

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,340
advanced tip as well I'm not going to

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,020
show you because I don't I'm not team

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,400
Green and I care about my hardware and

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:17,429
open source so there's a feature in team

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,700
green that had that in Vinc exists and

00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:22,500
you can apply in Vinc in open and

00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,350
akkadian life but you can't really do it

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,659
very well exactly because you have to go

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,940
you have to also install shotcut take

00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:32,820
the library features of shotcut and then

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,770
implement them inside of kdenlive so

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,559
it's a really weird way of doing it but

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,700
it's technically possible so if you

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,799
wanted to do it that'll speed up your

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:46,230
renders and nothing else just the render

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:49,049
and it's it is useful but they are

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,720
working on video acceleration for just

00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:54,090
itself so you the AMD improvements will

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,600
be coming in a future release when I

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,250
have no idea but I'm a huge fan of

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,070
kdenlive because of how much power it

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,630
gives you by default it looks kind of

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,470
cumbersome if you were to use open shot

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,179
it's a lot easier it's more of a like a

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:12,480
iMovie or a Windows Movie Maker approach

00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:14,340
but this one has so much more power and

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,059
it can do a lot more and a lot faster

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,280
that I am just a big fan of using the

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,990
using kdenlive for the most most part

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,220
there are a ton of different things you

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,400
can do there are a ton of different

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,650
features I haven't talked about and

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,200
unfortunately there's just too much to

00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:33,270
discuss as far as like going through

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,200
each effect and each thing that you can

00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,700
use but the best thing about kdenlive is

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,289
that it also had not best thing there's

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,490
a ton of great things but one of the

00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,620
best things about the cating life is it

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,840
has a lot of keyframe Abul aspects and

00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,299
it allows all your effects to be able to

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,809
apply a key a key frame to your effect

00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,850
and

00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,879
and change the effect in the key frame

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,259
directly on the clip so I don't have a

00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:56,309
preview of showing you that because I

00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:00,059
just thought of to tell you right now

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:02,009
and the key frame you just go into this

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:05,759
the effect panel which would be right up

00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:08,070
here just right up here and then you

00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,019
just choose like you here's what I want

00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,419
a keyframe you add a keyframe button

00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,220
then you change the value go to the next

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,539
part of the video add a keyframe button

00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,100
change the value to whatever you wants

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:20,309
whatever whatever else you wants and

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,529
that makes you it allows you to do audio

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,809
changing some transformation changes and

00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:26,789
all kinds of opacity settings and

00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,730
whatever you want key framing is

00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:32,009
available in kdenlive and it works quite

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,289
well now there are also like a lot of

00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,369
effects like chroma keying and a ton of

00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,350
things that you have to have equipment

00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,059
to make it work but for the most part

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,590
the majority of what you would want to

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,899
do in kdenlive is totally possible in

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,330
totally easy to do once you know how the

00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:47,999
shortcuts work because they're a little

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,740
esoteric and odd but are there any

00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:56,299
questions as far as you know kdenlive

00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,299
right go ahead mm-hmm

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,350
are you talking about like the coloring

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,350
grading

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,299
yeah so there's there's the the best way

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:16,409
to do it is to do it separately so you

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,539
want to have them have the video

00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,640
side-by-side and try to figure out what

00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,799
color grading you want to do and then

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,169
edit that one video to get the color

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,179
grading correct the you and I would say

00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:28,559
that the best way to do it is in Kate in

00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,440
life because it does have color grading

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,399
in it as far as open source wise so like

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,440
you could use light works and they'd

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,360
probably be a lot easier because light

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,640
works does have a really good color

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,830
grading system inside of it but kdenlive

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,620
is the best open source approach to it

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,720
so I would say use Kate in life to do

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,190
the editing of individually of that

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,350
color grading not in the full project

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,880
because if hours if I need to do it

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,409
because they're sometimes I don't know

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,149
if why you specifically chose the color

00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:55,440
blue but there's a couple episodes where

00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:58,559
of destination limits where my face is

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,250
blue a lot from a wallpaper and the

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,460
choice to fix it is to go in and color

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:08,190
grade my video and then render that

00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,019
section and put it into the podcast and

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:15,059
re-render the whole podcast so the

00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:19,610
method I used was to ignore it and so

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:19,610
any any other questions

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:31,020
you have to find them the transition

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,780
effect is is built into Kate in life the

00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,090
actual animation itself is not a Caden

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,920
life thing that is a video that you

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,750
there's a ton of different presets

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,390
because this the one of the cool things

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,540
about that style of transition is that

00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,580
it is it's very popular and also works

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,320
in literally every editor that has the

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,570
ability to matte transitions so any any

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,760
editor that has compositing or full

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,340
compositing can do that so if you have

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,970
some if you find a template that it's

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,160
for Premiere Pro or you know final final

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,480
cut or whatever it will still work it

00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,890
doesn't matter what kind of video is as

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,380
long as it is a transition video where

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,730
it has a white color for the the

00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,470
animations coming in and then

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,930
transparent background for with

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:23,760
everything else

00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:25,680
zebb do you mean that do I have a list

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:34,170
of my things or do I have things in the

00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:36,240
notes or whatever that's a good question

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,190
and there will be little when I post it

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,190
online there will be yes like right now

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,870
no but I will be so there's multiple

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:48,590
libraries and stuff so they don't work

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,590
for anything you get another one okay

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,690
yeah

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,620
oh yeah a good good question because I

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,540
totally forgot to do that because

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,390
there's a super easy of when I was

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,490
explaining the the alt left and alt

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,170
whatever if you have if you want to take

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,580
a video and do an outtake you want to

00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,700
put it all the way at the end if you

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,190
just click the clip hold it down and hit

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,600
control end it will move your timeline

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,890
all the way to the end and then you just

00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,860
let go of the clip and it'll be at the

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:39,050
end yeah so it'll take a like two

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:47,410
seconds yeah there's another question

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:47,410
over here I do

00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:12,250
more than likely it will because of the

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:14,320
benefit of because of the in Vinc

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,440
support support for the encoding it

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,700
could use that it's de CLE possible to

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,080
do it and they have discussed whether

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,549
they're going to be able to like allow

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,309
you to choose it as a preset for the

00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,299
render so you're they're gonna not

00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:27,309
necessarily preset but I like the

00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:29,200
variable parameters you can add that to

00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:31,600
it they're talking about adding it as an

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,770
option but they haven't done it yet so I

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,940
don't know if they're actually going to

00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:38,340
because they haven't verified whether

00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,340
they will but they haven't discussed it

00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,980
that's true too and also just rendering

00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:46,780
and if you don't have hardware

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,490
acceleration rendering is a is a chore

00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,040
unless you have a thread Ripper then

00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,870
it's amazing I don't have one of those

00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,870
but I've seen it done so

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,860
oh wow okay so have I ever used

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:09,920
cinelerra and why do I hate it okay so I

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:12,770
can give you a ride on't hate it but it

00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,020
is an awkward editor and not in the

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,520
sense of how you use it the the problem

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,380
with the a with the Senate Lera I found

00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,090
is that there are way too many sin

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,809
Alerus there's like five different

00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:26,390
versions of cinelerra and when I promote

00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,860
a particular application and I go well

00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,540
similair is great and they're like well

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,250
which one do I get because this one

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,050
didn't work well you have to get this

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,030
one as a fork of this fork in this fork

00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,280
and that's why I don't really like to

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,440
promote cinelerra because if it's it's a

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,380
pretty good tool I would say it's on par

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,720
with KDE in many ways or kdenlive I mean

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,990
and I don't think it's not necessarily a

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,640
bad odor I just think that they need to

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,350
rebrand it and whoever has the latest

00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,990
community version because there's like a

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,880
cv version or something like that needs

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,510
to just be rebranded and get rid of the

00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,010
name cinelerra

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,370
get anything else because it doesn't

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:03,170
it's just it's too complicated for even

00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,730
for technical people to find it because

00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,120
it's not worth the effort

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,120
really

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,039
oh yeah

00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:32,970
no no no you can definitely never never

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:37,330
even suggest such a horrible thing so

00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:45,970
the question about the the vacated Zinta

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:48,100
Larry questions every time on ok so I

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:51,850
think that maybe the question was about

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:54,400
the the open shot aspects and yeah the

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,620
different editors yeah there's a lot of

00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,900
different editors that are in Linux

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:02,260
there's a lot of open shot editors which

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:06,280
is weird because we have we have like

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:09,910
one option for a solid email client on

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:13,600
the desktop and we have like 15 video

00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:15,880
editors so I'm not sure why they were

00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,950
focusing on that but whatever but

00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,050
there's open shot is an interesting

00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,120
thing because it's it's got some cool

00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:24,010
features the blender structure that they

00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,280
have for the automated animation titles

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,080
that's a really cool feature but there

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,630
are some issues with the open shot in

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,730
the sense that it has it's missing a lot

00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,950
of features that I that our production

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,140
wise are necessary like it doesn't have

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,480
most the effects that are in kdenlive it

00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:44,470
doesn't have quick jumps as well as good

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,970
as kdenlive has it's and some some

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,310
versions is a little crash that's true

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:51,070
but also you know it happens and all of

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:53,440
them but there's different benefits to

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,880
all of them I think shotcut is a really

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,700
good editor too if you want to check it

00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,910
out it's it's it's a very unique method

00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,940
of editing but the reason why I shot cut

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,860
is worth checking out is it's a workflow

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,380
that kind of feels natural so if you

00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,600
want to do a transition on kdenlive you

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,880
basically put a clip over another clip

00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,010
and then hit the corner of one of the

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,130
clips whichever's ones on top and then

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:20,430
it'll transition to the next one and

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:23,500
that's kind of awkward but it works fine

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,330
it with with shot cut you just kind of

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,890
drag the clip hover it over a little bit

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,630
drop it and it creates the animation

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,940
automatically like that's a pretty cool

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,610
feature so it feels more natural but at

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:37,240
the same time the rendering it needs

00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,980
work so the rendering issue is that if

00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,390
you want to have a really high quality

00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,800
anything you have to tweak it all the

00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:46,840
time and when it exports sometimes it'll

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,930
export really slowly and the file will

00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,250
be gigantic I've had times where I

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,560
rendered something in kdenlive took the

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,470
exact same work I'm and built another

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,359
thing in shot cut shot cut took three

00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,880
times longer and the file was four times

00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:03,250
larger for no apparent reason really

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,410
because they both use the same rendering

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,510
encoding system in the backend which is

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,800
MLT and the other thing that it's kind

00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,990
of odd about that is the guy who makes

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,270
MLT also makes shot cut so that

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,190
shouldn't happen but that's what it for

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,780
me and my experience is what it does so

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,180
that there all of a lot of options but I

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,060
think kdenlive is the most well rounded

00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,290
option of all of them as far as the open

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,690
source options if you wanted to talk

00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:29,109
about light works or DaVinci Resolve

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,390
which is terrible yeah there's there's

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,710
there's tons of different features that

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,440
are options if you want to check them

00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,950
out but I think kdenlive is by far the

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,700
best

00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:41,140
once you learn all of the weird

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,700
shortcuts and structures because some of

00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:49,950
they don't make any sense pretty much at

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,950
all back there I can't really hear you

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,359
yeah

00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,540
how long would it take to be efficient

00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:17,960
in kdenlive okay what are you moving

00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:19,760
from yeah like premier okay so okay the

00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,380
trend it depends on what they do is they

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,940
use premier in a sense that some people

00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,290
use photoshop in the sense that they use

00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,940
it because they don't they just think

00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,619
it's it's if they're told it's the best

00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,630
and therefore they use it but they don't

00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,670
really use utilize anything that's super

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,890
special the premier then it's a pretty

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,180
easy current transition but if they've

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,790
been using for a certain amount of time

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,680
the transition of shortcuts are gonna be

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,930
completely different because there's not

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,940
a single shortcut that's similar well

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,420
okay the only one that similar is the

00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,040
delete key they remove a track that's it

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:52,400
everything else is some weird decision

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,869
like if you want to cut a clip like I

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,450
showed you earlier you just go to the

00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:58,880
end go to use the if you're actually on

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:03,020
the thing you move the playhead around

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:07,190
and you use the the shift R is the

00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,420
shortcut what does our shift our have to

00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,170
do with cutting something I don't know

00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,580
but that's what they did for some reason

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,200
yeah but it's you're not on the razor

00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,300
tool that's the why it's kind of weird

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,369
that's a good point it's a fair point

00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,500
but the rights are total you can just

00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:24,109
ignore it like I said because that's way

00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,210
faster and more accurate and also one of

00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:30,200
the biggest features of any kind of

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,940
editor is having the like if a lot of

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,560
people can argue disagree with this

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,980
point but I think if you're gonna zoom

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,050
on a timeline the video track is

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,970
irrelevant to that zoom the only thing

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:44,030
that matters is the audio track and the

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:46,490
audio thumbnail so you want to be able

00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,650
to zoom in exactly where you want to cut

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,230
that audio the newest version of

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,240
kdenlive has that built into it much

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,099
better because of the hal there's the

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,280
contrast is so much better so when you

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,869
zoom into it it makes it a lot easier so

00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,550
that's why if you look at the thing it's

00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:03,380
basically the video track is worthless

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,480
it's just a small thumbnail you don't

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,849
care about that but that audio track you

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,230
can be very precise on the Edit and if

00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:11,269
you don't have the audio track you're

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,089
just basically guessing so there's

00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:16,189
some editors that don't have audio

00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:17,479
thumbnail waveforms which is basically

00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:20,029
my opinion makes that editor not even

00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:34,130
worth bothering there any more questions

00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:37,729
yeah what do you mean yeah yeah you can

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:44,539
do that well I'm not sure I'm not sure

00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:47,349
what you mean by oh no Nanak Aidan life

00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:51,499
not that I'm aware of

00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:53,149
mm-hmm oh absolutely it's a good

00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:55,069
question I totally forgot about that

00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:57,890
should have been anything so price

00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:59,599
eclipses are very important and for some

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,549
reason by default in 1904 they are

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,799
turned off so turn them on as soon as

00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:06,939
you start using kdenlive because they

00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:12,289
should be essentially a proxy clip is a

00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:14,779
way to sort of pre render in a smaller a

00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:17,469
smaller file size that fits good in this

00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,819
preview mode so this preview mode is

00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:21,649
never going to be your full project size

00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:23,839
unless you full screen and yours gonna

00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:26,749
do it like a little quick look at it

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,119
so the proxy clips will sort of do a pre

00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:31,219
render and make it like a 480p video or

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,509
a 360 p video or whatever and it allows

00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:34,699
you to speed up the timeline and

00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:36,949
playback so it doesn't have any negative

00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:39,679
effect of you know your buffering your

00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:41,839
studdering options but by default it is

00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:50,979
all for some reason so turn it on

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:56,559
immediately sort of the the answer is

00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:56,559
yes and no I should go back to

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,130
you can kind of do it that way there is

00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,230
a technically our way to do multicam

00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,400
editing but it's not really a full

00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,360
multi-candidate that's why I'm saying

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,320
it's yes and no so if you set up this

00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,670
that's also a good question another

00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,820
thing that I meant to talk about thank

00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:27,610
you so right here is the multitrack view

00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,770
and now this is a black thing it's a

00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,280
black workspace just trust me that's

00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,970
what it is

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,970
so this section is that track the top

00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:38,440
track so you can do a side by side or if

00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,630
you have multiple tracks you can have

00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,130
them in a grid and it will show you all

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,870
the tracks at once and you can edit them

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,240
all at once but it won't render like

00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,830
this so you if you wanted to have it in

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,030
this structure you still have to go back

00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:51,190
and put them in the right position and

00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:54,520
everything is still only a single layer

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,900
structure of the render so if you render

00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,960
it this way you'll just see the black

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:01,180
the black color clip and that's it so

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,310
once you this is just more of a preview

00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,140
while you edit once you render you have

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,780
to do extra steps to do that it is

00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:11,220
possible to create some kind of extra

00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:13,770
special effect to move that by doing a

00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:17,890
transformed so I can show you what the

00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:20,320
transform effect is not in this version

00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:26,530
because it's not a favorite so let go

00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:28,390
here that has all of them so you go to

00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,480
the crop and transform and you go to the

00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:33,820
transform option and here it gives you

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,070
the option to choose the pixel size the

00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:38,920
location by x by x & y pixels and you

00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,900
can choose that per this size overall or

00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,190
just percentage-wise if you wanted to so

00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,930
and then you where here you can control

00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,640
like a quick snap so you want to go to

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,070
the top left the top right you know

00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,660
bottom left center whatever that kind of

00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,190
thing allows you to quickly do it so

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,260
basically the best option let's say you

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,540
have a video and you want to do if you

00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:00,250
have 4 4 videos you want into a grid

00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:03,460
style you would actually say resize with

00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:05,230
this transform tool into 50% and then

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,200
put it to which corner you want it to be

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:11,620
and then stack them on top of each other

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,900
and then you're done so it actually is

00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:17,539
possible to do that to do the editing

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,609
but I render with a different effect but

00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:22,460
the problem with that mainly is that the

00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:24,890
effect adds a lot of render time because

00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,750
you're adding a full effect to all of

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,960
the different clips to render everything

00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:33,020
on the full project so while it will

00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,390
work it will pretty much double the

00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:39,849
render time whatever it is so it's

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,849
technically possible but not ideal

00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:53,660
so yeah they are sort of they are listed

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,890
a little bit but not exactly the 1812 is

00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,770
easier with shortcuts because they

00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:00,050
changed his stuff but the 1904 does have

00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,300
the shortcuts that 1904 is improved the

00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,450
shortcuts by adding more things like for

00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:08,420
example in 1812 you can't do a shortcut

00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,550
for removing spaces like you have to use

00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,020
the context menu but it's not that bad

00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,300
because you just right-click hit a

00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,100
letter and it would do it so it's not

00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,600
terrible even in the older version but

00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,950
the newest version has it has it all set

00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,510
up where you can basically create a

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,410
shortcut for anything you want and the

00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,540
shortcuts are right here you just

00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,369
configure short cut and you can choose

00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,640
everything from even opening the about

00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:33,110
menu for some reason but you get you do

00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,910
all kinds of stuff in here and they

00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,920
remove spaces in here they remove all

00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:40,369
track space and then whatever is in all

00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,560
in here and some of the stuff should be

00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:45,680
selected by default and have a default

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,970
shortcut and doesn't so some of these

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,830
things I'm talking about you would have

00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:51,560
to go in and add some shortcuts to it

00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:54,020
and I can give you and when I post this

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,320
video along with the library suggested I

00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:02,960
can provide like a shortcut scheme or

00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:04,220
something if you want it's just a

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,030
configuration you just go to config

00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,619
katie kdenlive

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:11,359
and it's one of the settings free

00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:16,190
encoding or no for rendering not for

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,660
timeline it's in the timeline anyway so

00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,109
yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:23,600
options in here and there's the the

00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:25,130
shortcuts are super awesome and once you

00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,780
get used to the shortcuts kdenlive

00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,160
editing is super fast in the very

00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,369
beginning of katie and live it's it's

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,980
pretty awkward and once you get used to

00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:36,340
the shortcuts they're awkward too so it

00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,340
doesn't matter

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,530
yeah yeah it's oh that's a good the

00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:56,400
project files are in XML

00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:56,400
so you yes

00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,950
absolutely you can totally do that you

00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,349
can take that once you have everything

00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,680
done as long as you have the only thing

00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:10,320
about that is that the the paths for

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,740
kdenlive are hard-coded and the their

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:17,430
hard-coded in the XML so if you have the

00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:19,470
path as you know on different folders or

00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,119
different locations and everything or

00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,980
different drives it makes it awkward to

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,320
do that but if it's all in the same sub

00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,780
path you can do that because you can

00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,550
just make you can just have a do like a

00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,030
project like the way to do that the most

00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:36,119
common solution is to have a home folder

00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,099
folder specifically for editing and then

00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,599
put everything in that folder and then

00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,910
when you're done and you want to render

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,500
it just have a folder on your server and

00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,329
then have the same thing you just have

00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,640
home editing and it will automatically

00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:49,680
work fine but if you have these files

00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,839
and I sometimes edit on different drives

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,040
it's not necessarily a great idea but it

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,510
works fine because I'm lazy sometimes

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,670
but it allows you to do it that way if

00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,990
you have the path correct otherwise it

00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,579
would kind of be awkward you did it

00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,450
wouldn't break it an impossibility you

00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:08,819
could still fix it by making it search

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,859
for finding those paths so you can make

00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:13,200
it actually if at any time you open a

00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:14,970
project file that says I can't find

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,710
these clips you what do you want to do

00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,000
it'll give you the option to find in

00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,980
search and refining the replacement if

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,130
wherever they want be trying to fix the

00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,930
path or you can abort it and just throw

00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:27,359
them out and replace him with like color

00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:29,190
clip fillers or you can just delete them

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,579
on the timeline there's multiple options

00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:34,170
of doing it but the the best option is

00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:35,790
actually kind of unfortunate because if

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,430
you have a if you want to have a render

00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:40,589
server you also need to have X on that

00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,210
render server so you can look at that

00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:45,300
because that option is only available in

00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,819
the GUI so if you do if your path does

00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,560
break you need to have you have you have

00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:51,060
to know that you can go in and fix it so

00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,180
you have to have a GUI set up for it it

00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:55,109
doesn't matter what GUI it or like what

00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:57,140
interface it is it just needs to have

00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:57,140
one

00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,520
you have to have X on the server for if

00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,500
you want to render on a server like if

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,850
you want to edit on your computer send

00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,220
it up to like a server farm for their

00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:13,800
rendering and then if you want be like

00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,200
you don't have to do that necessarily to

00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,210
create the render because you can render

00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,650
in the command line but if you anytime

00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,840
there's anything that messes up that you

00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,180
have to fix you have to use the GUI to

00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,820
do it like it's super complicated with

00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:29,880
the XML to modify it like my

00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,650
modifications took me like a week to

00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,710
figure out how to make it work to do

00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,330
what I wanted with the guides and so you

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,970
basically have to convert your time

00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:42,180
stamp into seconds modify it and put

00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:44,550
those into a guide XML custom XML guide

00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,700
structure and then you have to put them

00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:49,350
in a particular place in the XML format

00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,180
otherwise it will break completely so

00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,640
it's very fickle and then when you

00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:56,940
change any clip information it changes a

00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,190
ton of stuff so like if you just take

00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:02,790
like for that one color clip you just

00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:06,510
drop a color clip in it has modified the

00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:08,760
XML about 40 lines so it's not really

00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:11,310
you know automatable in that sense but

00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,700
some aspects can be automated and that's

00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:16,050
the example of of destination Linux is

00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,940
that I automated the guide system

00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:20,880
because that's pretty simple and it

00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,320
allows me to more quickly edit even

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,790
though there's not an automatic edit

00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,350
structure that way you can't really do

00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,030
it automatically anyway but that's fine

00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:31,170
because I can't really do automatic

00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:33,000
because my co-hosts are don't typically

00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:40,170
stick to the schedule the structure that

00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,640
I want you know is notes so I always

00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,780
want them to give me a couple seconds

00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,580
for editing and they're like yeah well

00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,560
dilly do that and like oh you hit the

00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,390
button to wait so we're gonna start

00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,550
right now okay cool

00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:54,170
but anyway that works out totally fine

00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:57,180
in most cases but the issue with that

00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,980
the issue with the automation is that

00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,740
it's so complicated in XML because it's

00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:06,320
super custom it's not really automation

00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,320
and friendly any more questions

00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:21,539
hmm Auto ducting not exactly because

00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:23,249
that's more of an attenuation thing and

00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:25,589
it would have to kind of scan the entire

00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:27,599
clip and then try to check to see what

00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:29,400
levels you are so it would mean it would

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,699
need to normalize an automatic

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,169
normalization not exactly because you

00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:36,150
can't do it across the whole clip and

00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:38,039
the whole track too so you once you have

00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:41,669
your music more than likely the music is

00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:42,689
not going to you know be that changing

00:50:41,669 --> 00:50:45,059
you know is gonna have a clip and it's

00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:47,609
gonna repeat and or whatever so you can

00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:49,679
actually right click the track and add

00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:51,959
an effect on the track and you can add a

00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,939
keyframe a bull volume control on that

00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:56,819
track and then it will anything in the

00:50:53,939 --> 00:50:58,829
track will also get that effect so it's

00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,999
kind of automatic in that sense but not

00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:01,229
in the sense of that you just tell it in

00:50:59,999 --> 00:51:05,959
which to figure it out and do it for you

00:51:01,229 --> 00:51:05,959
so it's it's not that advanced there

00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:15,989
yeah yeah Reapers a good option -

00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,349
there's there's there's quite a few ways

00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:19,199
to do it

00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:20,880
Osen audio is an also good editor that

00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,890
does some normalization and some effect

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,209
automation if you wanted to but Reaper

00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:27,989
is definitely a more professional tool

00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:34,199
for it so good suggestion there any more

00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:39,630
questions all right awesome now is

00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:45,779
anybody here from the last years a talk

00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:50,519
that I gave ok how this one I would say

00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:51,959
was probably successful last years was a

00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:54,479
complete disaster

00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:57,390
really there was technical problems and

00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:59,909
it wasn't my fault I saved it so I'm

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,169
just saying so I want to appreciate you

00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:05,489
all coming back and dealing with it

00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:07,979
again so the kdenlive redo part do I

00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:10,439
guess so thank you very much for coming

00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:11,759
and I hope is helpful if you have any

00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:13,289
more questions after there's after the

00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:16,440
talk feel free to catch me in the

00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:22,309
hallway and yeah thanks for coming

00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,309
[Applause]

00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,640
you

00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,800
