If you are doing software development (or want to), and have never heard of Jenkins (or don't know much about Jenkins), then you are missing out. This talk will discuss what Jenkins is, how to install and manage Jenkins, and strategies for getting Jenkins to do useful things (jobs and pipelines). I will discuss also some modern Jenkins best practices along the way.
