You are not a product, but many social network sites see you as one.  Every word, like, and click meticulously tracked and analyzed to optimally sell you to their customers.  Those customers of varying ethics and security competency then keep that data for their own uses.  Sometimes on unsecured S3 buckets for anyone to download.  Even though those sites are free as in beer you sacrifice a lot when it comes to your freedom as in liberty! This talk is going to focus on self-hosted options provided by the Fediverse to keep the best parts of social networks and weed out the bad.  You can get started with a shared host with PHP or go even more on your own terms with a RaspberryPI on your desk.   Prepare to go free!
