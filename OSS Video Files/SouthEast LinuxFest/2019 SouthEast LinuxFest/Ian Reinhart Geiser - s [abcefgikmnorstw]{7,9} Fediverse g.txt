You are not a product, but many social network sites see you as one.  Every word, like, and click meticulously tracked and analyzed to optimally sell you to their customers.  Those customers of varying ethics and security competency then keep that data for their own uses.  Sometimes on unsecured S3 buckets for anyone to download.  Even though those sites are free as in beer you sacrifice a lot when it comes to your freedom as in liberty! This talk is going to focus on self-hosted options provided by the Fediverse to keep the best parts of social networks and weed out the bad.  You can get started with a shared host with PHP or go even more on your own terms with a RaspberryPI on your desk.   Prepare to go free!

the light in the front oh it's blinking

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:13,769
uh well I'm it's blinking so I'm

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,619
assuming it's meaningful

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,900
I've been indoctrinated in technology

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:36,829
enough to know if a light blinks must be

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:36,829
interesting that might be wise blinking

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm not touching either I'm just well I

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,609
think that's kopi so that might I don't

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:18,740
know why that Buehring but that's not a

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:18,740
me problem hello yes

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:26,020
oh it's screen now so yup and it's 11:30

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:38,570
well I I I'm notorious for not following

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:42,710
directions alright well thank you very

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:44,120
much for being here we are going to talk

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:49,390
about the Federer

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:53,660
I actually picked the most wrong title

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,380
for this talk on purpose to kind of

00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,360
drive home a point I will discuss about

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:02,840
3/4 of the way through this talk as a

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,860
disclaimer I am NOT representative of

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,020
the Federer

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,670
I am not associated with the Federer

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:13,360
this has come of it from a journey more

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:18,709
than 7 months but 7 months in earnest of

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:25,959
irritation and self-discovery in thought

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:28,970
about what's social networking is so yes

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm not the expert there will be people

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,070
who know a lot more details about the

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,930
services I will discuss I'm only

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,090
discussing the ones that I have

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,290
physically sat down installed and

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,610
tinkered with so that's why there is a

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,360
very small number

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,959
I also focused on Interop because

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,810
Federation is the key part of this so to

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,080
get started I would like us to start

00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,860
with a little thought experiment um

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,260
so I'm assuming many of you have gotten

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,220
out of school and we're looking for a

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,720
domicile um let's pretend that you are

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:15,310
any career except for construction or

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,350
something related to building a domicile

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,720
so they're very expensive you could

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:25,630
purchase one you're not sure how you can

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:29,200
maintain it you but they're available so

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:33,740
you find out that there are these free

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,860
apartments so you're like wow I'm

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,740
gonna try that and you move in it's very

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,040
nice I mean it's new wallpaper or Lawson

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,860
really modern decorations and it's pre

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,580
furnished so that's cool um you get in

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,940
and of course the landlord he is uh he

00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,740
is a master key and you know it's it's a

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,480
landlord he's okay

00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,530
I mean he's gonna have to come and go

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,530
not a problem

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,310
this is it really embarrassing so let's

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,590
follow this a little further you also

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,470
know that their employees have the

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,730
master key to UM but yeah that's because

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,920
they have to fix things when they're

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,770
broken their maintenance that's okay and

00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,560
it's a little odd that sometimes the the

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,470
landlord brings his friends through to

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,680
look at your stuff and kind of poke

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,290
around your apartment to see like how it

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,570
all looks and it's odd but you think

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,460
it's okay because they they come back

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,860
and tell you how you can redecorate

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,780
nicer or new things you could put up on

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,340
the wall so you let that slide then

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,790
things get a little strange though

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:11,840
because sometimes the employees lose the

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,300
master key and people come in and they

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,130
like piss on your carpet and take some

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,860
of your stuff and move it around and

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,750
that's really annoying and but you

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,080
landlord and his employees come and

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,760
clean it up and change the keys um but

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,690
at this point you're like there's a lot

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,660
of stuff going on here maybe I need to

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,570
find a new apartment at that moment you

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,660
realize that the landlord actually owns

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,300
all of your furniture and while you can

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,310
take some things with you they get to

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,060
keep all the bits and bobs that hold

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:55,520
them together so now let's think about

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:58,400
that and are you okay with that so let's

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,580
start with the cloud there is no cloud

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,470
it is someone else's computer and there

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:11,960
are consequences to it being someone

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:16,700
else's computer you are renting their

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,760
thing to do something it's a good'n so

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:24,460
transfer of services which is valid

00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:28,729
that's okay but there are some

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,360
consequences the powers that be have

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,770
kind of mutated things in the beginning

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,919
social networking was

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:40,990
people being sociable like a newsgroup

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,849
or IRC then we went to message boards

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,789
but then you know these services had to

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:49,130
make money and there were also like

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:53,900
media platforms and they thought well

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:57,949
let's mix these two together so now you

00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:02,410
have advertising and some guy yelling

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:06,229
obscenities office rooftop as peers

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:09,710
there different one is about corporate

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:13,639
messaging PR and public image the other

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:17,870
one is about you being a stupid human

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,699
and doing stupid things now this is

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,280
further consolidated because these

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,069
services are very difficult to provide

00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,280
in bulk so they've consolidated around a

00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:30,770
small number of content providers now

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,550
these content providers are the conduit

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:39,199
for the media that goes in and the

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:41,659
voices that come back out they can

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,289
create filter bubbles they can create

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,990
the world you live in that's a little

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:52,190
problem there's also the matter of

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:55,099
security who watches the Watchmen there

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,620
are developers who just read your data

00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,469
and snapchat was in the news lately

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,419
that those messages that disappear after

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,280
a while that their developers were

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,090
sitting passing those videos around the

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,909
company that's not OK that that is

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,310
clearly a violation of what we assumed

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:15,919
their fiduciary responsibility was but

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:19,520
we signed the signs we sign their terms

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:24,710
and agreement so you know it was our

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,919
fault anyway so Alexa training who heard

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:32,479
the one about feeding read edit posts in

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,640
the Train Alexa BOTS and it was like

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,469
sending out messages to people like to

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,329
kill their foster parents and stuff when

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,430
they're experimenting with the system

00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:46,889
that we are using to rely on our

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:51,899
communication and media

00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:55,589
not cool there's also questionable

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,329
security practices the fact that we're

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,689
finding out a lot of these services have

00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:03,529
been using unhatched passwords who in

00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:10,850
here has ever maintained a multi-user

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:20,009
UNIX system who in here uses etc' pass

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:23,009
password yeah but what's in the in that

00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:28,589
G Coast there oh wait it's in the shadow

00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:32,160
file which is hashed to heck why did

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,669
these developers not just put that in

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,730
their code well you know no one no one's

00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:41,850
watching there's no third party audits

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,160
no one's coming in and saying well your

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,790
database this code is vulnerable to SQL

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,269
injection the one audits that no one

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,540
looks at that code we we assume their

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,759
competency is following CVEs and

00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,669
securing systems and to varying degrees

00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:04,799
they're successful as far as we know and

00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:08,519
I think the most disturbing of it is we

00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:12,619
are a product they make a lot of money

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:18,209
off of our data they are renting our

00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:22,709
pictures to us so our personal stories

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:26,610
ideas memories are being rented to us as

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:29,040
a service and that for compensation they

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,789
get to mine that data they get to sell

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,039
that to third parties and again those

00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:38,039
third parties may or may not have good

00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,809
security hygiene and may put clear text

00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,059
passwords that were not hashed in the

00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:45,119
first place on an AWS bucket without a

00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:50,910
password attached to that either where

00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:53,579
people find these things so in the end

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:59,819
the goal of the service is to create

00:10:53,579 --> 00:11:00,870
more data for them to sell so some of

00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:04,290
you might ask

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,120
who cares about my pictures and messages

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,550
anyway that's not like I'm a political

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,040
dissident or trying to overthrow the

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:17,490
government well I Got News for you honey

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:22,310
it's not big brother he does not care

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:26,460
about you you know who cares about you

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:29,010
marketing they want you to buy their

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:32,339
stuff and the best way for them to sell

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,410
you their stuff is to know exactly what

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:38,880
you're thinking what you're feeling and

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,570
what you're interested in also did you

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,960
know according to a study done by

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:49,770
Careerbuilder last year 70% of companies

00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:54,600
that are hiring use social media to

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:58,170
research candidates so things imagine if

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,240
a prospective employer came into your

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,570
living room and overheard a conversation

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,300
between you and your cousin's that they

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,850
may or may not know the context and use

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,060
that as a reference character reference

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:16,520
to hire you are you okay with that

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:19,770
conversation being recorded worse 43%

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,580
reported that they use social media to

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:27,630
monitor current employees so you are

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,970
being watched at all times well not all

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,790
the time just random snapchat snap it's

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,589
that come up in Google which is even

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:40,080
worse there's also now that we've

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,540
willingly given up this data that we are

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:48,120
renting from another company the Fourth

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:52,650
Amendment protections get very funny you

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,260
know there are questionable morality

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:58,380
laws that are enforced at varying

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:03,360
degrees depending on your gender color

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:06,350
or orientation that can be used for

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,270
seizing your data as a pretext and

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,630
there's also a slippery slope for more

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,840
as we become more as companies observe

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,630
us become more

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,820
comfortable with our data being used as

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,800
they see fit

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:26,110
more companies will do it such as

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:29,340
ancestry.com which routinely sells DNA

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,600
information to anybody who purchases it

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,490
even law enforcement doesn't need a

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,560
warrant nowadays they can just purchase

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:40,660
it so as this goes where is this going

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,730
to end and as a slippery slope you never

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:49,650
notice it until you're flying down the

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:54,070
hill so what is the alternative I

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:56,980
believe it is the Fed averse this is a

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,930
horrible name but hey that's what

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:05,740
happens when you have engineers do

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:12,130
marketing basically the goal is you are

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:14,800
the absolute authority on you ideally

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,870
you know yourself and what you like what

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,090
you dislike what you're offended by what

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,000
you're passionate about better than

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,800
someone else if you don't there are a

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,850
couple doctors in my area I can

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,830
recommend they're very good and you can

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,350
get up and move at any time if I'm on

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,750
one mastodons instance and I've decided

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,420
that the community there is not one I

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,570
wish to associate with I could move to

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:45,640
another day instance and since they're

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:48,520
using these activity pub oh oh data open

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,120
protocols it's a lot easier you can take

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,660
your furniture with you so you have more

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,080
freedom but there's also there's open

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,850
standards for choice why did we get into

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,130
open source in the beginning because we

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,590
wanted to do it our way we wanted to

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,530
have control and a choice so we have

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:13,330
things like activity pub which basically

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:14,590
allows you its SMTP with JSON guys let's

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,870
not kid ourselves

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,600
they fix some parts that were

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:24,820
questionable but it's basically inbox

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:27,699
and pop mail so but was pretty effective

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:31,899
for 40 years

00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:34,119
so we're using that webfinger yeah that

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:37,299
was another oldie but a goodie they just

00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:41,980
use an HTTP endpoint that you can query

00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:44,410
and get data from open ID this one is

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,829
very interesting because it's the idea

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,709
that there is a trusted source that me

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:54,790
isn't a third party trusts they trust

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:57,129
you so I can say all right he thinks he

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,279
knows who you are so I'll accept that

00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:03,549
you say who you are that is very nice

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:06,399
and federated services because as the

00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:11,470
Federation grows trust between the nodes

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:15,279
you have a better reliability of

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:19,299
identity and then last there's web auth

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,009
and which is relatively new one of the

00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:25,329
interesting parts of it is the phyto 2

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:27,669
standard which allows for basically

00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:30,899
replacing your password with a really

00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:34,749
interesting hash that is tied to

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:38,919
biometric USB token things that you're

00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:40,720
not having to remember a password that

00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,809
you have to have a certain complexity

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,579
and change every so often there are some

00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:49,329
consequences to that but we'll get to

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:52,720
that next so there are some out there

00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:56,829
today that do this the most popular one

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,660
by far is Mastodon they have a main

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:02,019
instance which helped a lot of their

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:05,919
popular popularity but you can also set

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:09,909
up your own instance and even if the

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:13,299
main instance decides to block your

00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:16,899
instance that all that does is keeps 8

00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:21,250
users from discovering you users on that

00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:24,100
system can still subscribe and message

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,399
back and forth or not because you have

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:30,299
control to knock that user out if you

00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:35,049
don't want to talk to them again you

00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:40,809
censor what you'd being fit I don't tell

00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:41,310
I have full rights to tell me what I do

00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,680
in

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,400
do not want to listen to I have

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,980
absolutely no right to tell you what you

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,500
can and cannot listen to and that is a

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,980
main tenet of many of these federated

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,560
services is that if you don't like the

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,510
message of where you are or the group of

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,450
where you are you go somewhere else

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:08,310
without losing the community you main

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:11,340
aspects you may want to keep Macedon

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:15,930
does have these nodes are people writing

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:19,710
servers mm notes is pretty good for

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:21,690
reliability the N it keeps the network

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,140
decentralized so there's no single choke

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,790
point there's also what this numbers

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,690
lower than what they advertise in their

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:33,780
site because this is they have a

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:36,240
traverse tracking site and there were in

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,910
the last six months 1.4 million active

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,720
users so that's more important to me

00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:44,760
because they seem to all get a spike in

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,250
new accounts whenever there's the data

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,230
breach so this is like kind of the

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,480
baseline of where the community's going

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,170
and they've been grow Macedon actually

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:58,440
been growing pretty steadily it's a

00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:01,740
little cumbersome to install but if

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,660
you've ever had to deal with like next

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,560
cloud or xbox media center it's not that

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,750
hard

00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,660
most of the time it's limitations of a

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,110
hosting provider

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:18,120
there's also hub Zilla hub Zilla is cool

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:22,200
it's it's a very mature one they were

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,140
one of the early Federation's they had

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,350
as OTT protocol and you could was it

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,840
Zoot or something other people huh again

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,810
never let open the developers do

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,480
marketing but they actually have

00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:41,220
basically gone and they support almost

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:44,850
every federated communication protocol

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,670
out there so you can talk to anybody I

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:50,790
like a lot of their approaches to how

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,520
you federate and control access like I

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,750
said it's a little more complicated of

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,660
the ones

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,970
the Macedon one thing that they have

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,690
that is very interesting to me is they

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:08,250
have an applications platform so you

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:10,620
have the ability to grow if you wanted

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,710
to monetize or do a game or something

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,270
based off of their API they actually

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,270
have something that you can work with

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:25,620
dysphoric we talked about a little they

00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:29,190
are probably one of the oldest ones they

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,540
are they have their own protocol for

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,900
Federation they're working on

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:37,380
integrating activity pub they may have

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:41,120
already but I couldn't I didn't look

00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:43,080
into it much when I did the install

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,130
unfortunately these guys have gotten a

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:51,600
very bad rap because because of when

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,700
they started doing non like social

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,300
networking outside of the mainstream a

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,340
lot of extremists and hate groups tended

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,160
to pop up on there and it's not fair to

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,380
really the open source people who were

00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,650
really the first ones to bat so it got a

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,260
real bad rap but it's still very good

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:14,460
it's very mature well maintained and

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:16,170
they have a concept of pods and it's a

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,080
little weird to get into it because

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:22,860
their idea is your pod is your community

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,440
and you kind of self select the people

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,350
you want to be around and you can move

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,370
around within the system but again

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,930
that's what made it easier for what

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,320
society considers questionable elements

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,000
to do questionable things one I'll get

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,520
to that later about some of the problems

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,690
we have here um friend Iike it it's an

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,610
older one um not as popular it really

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,740
came on the scene is like a drop-in

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,350
Facebook replacement they've got a lot

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,000
of bells and whistles I really got to

00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,900
that one near the end so I didn't have a

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,730
chance to really push it it's kind of a

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,520
gentle introduction though because it

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,580
does a lot of the services that your

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Twitter that your Facebook that your

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,850
that's some of the Instagram some of the

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,190
things that they allow you to do one of

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:20,040
the coolest things is the way it is

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,890
written it's kind of the same philosophy

00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,679
as next cloud is you can get a very low

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,380
end web hosting company that like if

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,750
they support PHP and have a MySQL

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,000
account like dream host or something

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,510
like that you can literally run an

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,580
instance for a reasonably sized club off

00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:45,240
of a $10 a month like web service or you

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:48,540
can go totally crazy so it is it's a

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,370
very low budget entry if you need to

00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,510
start if you want to start private

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:57,000
groups or clubs or things like that now

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,179
this one is interesting I didn't have

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
six months of data so this is really

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,250
very recent these guys are going in a

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,220
direction that I personally personally

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,740
feel is better it's it's it's brand new

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,130
I don't know where it's gonna go but

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:18,500
their idea is that they have a back-end

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:23,760
and they they want to promote that

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,710
everybody has their own back end so you

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,890
feder a twith in that to further

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,030
eliminate the ability of having a

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:36,740
central choke point of censorship they

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:39,360
have a very nice pretty looking you

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,549
i-i-i think it's cool I'm gonna keep my

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,429
eye on it I like the direction they're

00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:46,679
going I personally would like to go more

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:52,230
to self sovereignty but we'll get to

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:54,559
that later so then there are I think

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,570
there were like 20 services on there

00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,600
like some included chat and some of the

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:04,970
did file sharing go to the Federation

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:09,780
dot info they allow you to select by

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:13,049
like language by protocol supported by

00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,770
number of users and they have graphs of

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:19,940
like metrics on how active they are I

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,600
would focus on things that are pushing

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,720
Interop with

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,300
Activity pub if they have just Bora

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,230
that's a pretty popular one that they

00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:35,010
use but I think as we move forward more

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:39,180
parties are going to be going to

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:42,270
activity pub and I think industry things

00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,790
like Twitter probably more than a

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:49,190
Facebook will start supporting that sort

00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:52,890
of activity it is an open standard it is

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:54,930
reasonably easy to implement so I think

00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:58,610
it's going to gain a lot of traction and

00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:01,980
and really find what works for you so

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:07,230
what's stopping everybody from doing

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:09,390
this cuz this sounds great Wow as an

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,390
engineer we stand there like Oh simple

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:15,570
all you have to do is just every time I

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:18,180
hear that like as I do a lot of sales

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:21,240
now in technical sales and every time I

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:24,300
hear one of my peers say all you gotta

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,500
do is just just stop them there because

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,840
it's going nowhere good because there

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,660
there is some complication to this

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,930
there's there is a lot of vendor lock-in

00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:40,770
it's a lot of effort to try to get as

00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:43,140
much data out of your current such and

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:46,380
muck around with things so it's easier

00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,050
just to it's not bad enough they'll just

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,200
live with it for now um there's also a

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:55,770
lot of messaging that you hear around

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,680
privacy people will say things like well

00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:01,350
if you don't have anything to hide you

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,410
have nothing to be afraid of and to

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:06,630
those people I reply you're right that

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,150
that's a very good point so I need you

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:12,390
to do me something I need you to go

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,190
downstairs get your mortgage I want like

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,800
the last year's bank statements and your

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,440
Social Security card lay them out on the

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,320
sidewalk here and we'll just leave more

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,060
mics you don't have anything to hide

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,800
well I don't know who's gonna look at

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,720
them and take stuff from me Dean again

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,840
it's not Big Brother that you have to

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,590
worry about I mean you do but whatever I

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,500
try

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:43,140
the government marginally more than I

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:45,779
trust industry there are when you have a

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,100
central choke point you have a big

00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:51,679
brother everywhere yes

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:55,970
so I think the messaging has been very

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:59,900
detrimental to the cause they associate

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:02,720
self sovereignty with being in an

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,460
undesirable element of the community

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,669
when in fact you are actually trying to

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,649
form community instead of living within

00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,799
the confines of what they tell you to be

00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:17,370
a community they also don't fully

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,010
understand the scope of what's going on

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,620
it's very easy to visualize when you see

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,320
your bank statements on the sidewalk but

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,480
they don't understand that little poll

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,630
that they see of what Harry Potter

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,330
character are you I'm a hopeful wolf

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,730
okay they now have got a demographic

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,080
information about you that they can file

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,360
in and say all right you're going to be

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,049
more susceptible to this form of

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,919
messaging so you are helping them

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:49,440
optimize to sell you things that you

00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,140
know do you really need how many people

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,149
buy toilet paper off of Facebook show of

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:59,120
hands nobody who buys the latest

00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:03,990
whatever gadget that's in the sidebar

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,549
come on admit it I know you do they're

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,440
trying to sell you stuff you probably

00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:12,480
don't need anyway um there's also

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,580
there's there's also that that

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,179
consumerism there's also I talked before

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,659
background checks you have people doing

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:23,270
a Google search on a name and getting

00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,880
random Facebook pages

00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:30,630
how many Rob Smiths are there in the

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:34,429
world how many are in your bread and

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:37,080
your graduating class so now you have

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:39,350
people who don't know better trying to

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,140
do a little sleuthing and find a

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:45,240
questionable post done by a teenager

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:48,460
five years ago who is now being

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,330
disqualified for a job because it

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,920
won't look good for our company image

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:58,180
that's again the social media aspect

00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,390
bleeding in there's also the problem of

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,390
managing hosted services as much as

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,690
people complain why Microsoft forces

00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:11,020
Windows 10 updates it is because of the

00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:14,200
amount of unpatched XP machines that

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:17,650
have fed BOTS armies for the last 15

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,880
years people don't want to patch and

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:24,580
maintain and blah blah blah I mean they

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,410
want to like go and sail a boat they

00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,210
want to work on their bathroom in the

00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:31,620
weekend they they don't want to upgrade

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:34,660
their router firmware most people like

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,450
you're lucky verizon now just puts in a

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:40,630
random hash of Pat of letters and tapes

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,390
it on the box because you let them pick

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:46,540
the password that's how you get another

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,850
BOTS army do essaying things because

00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,910
they infiltrate these so there there's a

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:55,420
real problem there in them maintaining

00:29:51,910 --> 00:30:00,010
these services and then also there's

00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:03,580
cost you don't see the cost of your data

00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:07,390
being spent so you know Facebook is free

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:10,360
we have been indoctrinated from day zero

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:15,010
that if it's on the internet it's free

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,260
as in beer that's not what he meant in

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,660
the beginning he said free is in speech

00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,850
we've had this discussion as Linux

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:29,280
people there's also the biggest problem

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:34,330
monetization unfortunately we live in a

00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:37,030
free free-market society which I happen

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:40,750
to appreciate when it is a truly free

00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:44,430
market and nobody can really make money

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:47,770
on people keeping things to themselves

00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:51,010
so there really hasn't been anybody to

00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:56,200
find in an exploitable market to

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:58,960
actually invest in this area so what can

00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,400
we do to help well you know I talked in

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,480
the beginning that that thought

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:09,560
experiment about being a carpenter

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:13,940
I have a room full of carpenters Society

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,860
is geometric you get one person who

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,430
impacts two other people into their

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,660
social network who impacts other people

00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:26,810
we have a we have been indoctrinated by

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:31,010
Facebook that you meet people by a query

00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:34,310
search imagine you standing at the mouth

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:37,340
of the Hudson tunnel staring into New

00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:40,640
York and yelling who likes teddy bears

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:44,120
and everybody in Manhattan who likes a

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,780
teddy bear says me and you all hang out

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,750
together okay

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,310
that's creepy but that's what we do when

00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,100
we go on to these social networks and

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:57,140
we're like hey let's talk about this

00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,510
meet space is actually a pretty cool

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:04,340
place to meet and interact with people I

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:07,400
get to know you before I kind of sign on

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,470
to that social contract with you you

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,320
could be a person I have coffee with

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,150
negative sit next to it and we go our

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:19,190
separate ways or you could be a lifelong

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:22,100
friendship let's establish that in a in

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,910
a personal setting it also helps

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,280
solidify things like identity trust

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:32,810
who's brought into a social group etc so

00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,750
I would encourage like these PGP signing

00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:41,150
parties where oh you have to identify

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:42,860
yourself yes we do that every day you

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,290
see the same person getting coffee at

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,380
the coffee shop and oh I recognize you

00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,930
and you talk to them so let's let's

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,840
focus on forming relationships like

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:57,050
humans do not like some programmer

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,620
thinks is easy to implement in his graph

00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,620
database

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:06,330
actually I've audited two anthropology

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,370
courses on Paleolithic - Neolithic

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:13,350
transfer the the change in culture so I

00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:17,159
am pretty sure I have scientifically

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:21,409
established how you can make a friend if

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:26,429
that doesn't sound creepy enough so

00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:29,760
let's pretend that Federation is just

00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:33,389
not good enough because hey there's some

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,220
guy managing a server who you may not

00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:38,690
agree with at some point you could fall

00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,720
out with them people's friends change um

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:46,559
you are the best judge of what comes in

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,080
and out of you you say something stupid

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,870
you're allowed to you may have

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,760
consequences but no one has the right to

00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,330
tell you what you should and shouldn't

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,889
say you could suffer consequences

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:03,120
socially or legally from what you do or

00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:05,429
say but you have that right likewise you

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,710
have the right to tell somebody I don't

00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:10,159
want to talk to you and I want to talk

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:13,470
to you we've been talking about consent

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,560
lately when it talks to when we deal

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:18,540
with romantic relationships but that

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,240
percolates down to every level of

00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,940
society if I don't want to talk to you

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,129
that's my choice but if I do want to

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,679
talk to you we have to make that choice

00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:31,109
together and the only way you can do

00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,270
that is if you're free to do that and

00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:36,389
you don't have somebody imposing those

00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:39,750
rules on you of who you should meet who

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:45,030
you shouldn't meet and what etc so we

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:47,429
are gonna talk about peer to peer again

00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:52,710
another technology that got a horrible

00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:55,770
rap BitTorrent BitTorrent again it's

00:34:52,710 --> 00:35:00,030
that idea that when you're in charge of

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:03,089
yourself there is no central choke point

00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:07,320
you can do more things as an organic

00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:09,150
group so these guys scuttlebutt they are

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,760
basically in at the end of the day there

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,750
are a peer to peer log store this has

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,910
some interesting content

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:22,690
winces it's a gossip based protocol so

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:24,550
it's actually closer to maybe early use

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,920
net where you had your servers

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,869
synchronizing every once in a while so

00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,970
it's it's more like a peer-to-peer well

00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,430
maybe fidonet when you're in BBS days

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:38,650
anyway what is old is new again

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:40,060
so it has end and encryption all the

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,460
records are encrypted because it's

00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,160
peer-to-peer it's a data store you have

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,099
to have encryption in every level access

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,260
control is not delegated by some admin

00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:53,260
or programmer who may or may not have

00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,500
implemented ACLs correctly it's done

00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:00,480
through encryption keys that is pretty

00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:04,119
easy to say you can see this you cannot

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,240
that's easy to implement they also have

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:10,530
a very nice API to build applications

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:15,010
off they have a couple proof of concepts

00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:18,339
including a github that is totally

00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:21,070
peer-to-peer decentralized kind of how

00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:23,349
it was originally intended but it runs

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,140
within their network they have chat they

00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:29,710
have some Twitter stuff they have a very

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,619
strong identity system because of the

00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,330
way that they have end-to-end encryption

00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:37,869
you can't have encryption without trust

00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:42,310
so they also have discoverability which

00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:45,820
in a peer-to-peer scenario is very very

00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:50,080
important one of the things and put this

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:53,680
up here one of the problems is with

00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,930
scuttlebutt is it is its own protocol so

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,060
it's not HTTP you can't go through it

00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,040
through a normal web browser you have to

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,790
write or you have to use a special

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:08,200
application that may or may not be a

00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:11,020
barrier to some people I there's a lot

00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,390
of value in to not having to install yet

00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,589
another thing on your computer that

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:21,490
could be infiltrated spyware or whatever

00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:24,339
MIT license so you have room to grow if

00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,260
you need to take the tinfoil hat and

00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:27,060
pull it a little tighter there is zero

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,240
net

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:34,060
these guys I have not dug into but they

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,530
have some really cool stuff where

00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,070
they're using BitTorrent for the

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:42,450
communications protocol for basically

00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:47,680
record publishing and data publishing

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:49,599
kind of a they're not really large file

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,020
like like movies they're more like

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,440
pictures and tweets stuff short and blog

00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,210
entries they have a very cool API they

00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,890
don't have a lot of scuttlebutt has

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,380
actually a lot of really cool

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,750
proof-of-concept apps and some that are

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:07,420
actually beyond proof of concept

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,760
zero net doesn't have a lot of them but

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,750
they have a very well-documented and

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:19,210
pretty flexible API and it's a open

00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:21,339
source license and of course there are

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,740
some programmers in here and we'll

00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:32,170
create our own social network with

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:34,540
blackjack and hookers so at this point I

00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,490
will take some questions and try to

00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:41,170
answer them with varying degrees of

00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:43,349
competency and we can go from there yes

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,349
sir

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,020
yes

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:49,440
well actually it is very actually it's a

00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:51,090
very good point and I think that it it

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,270
gives me a chance to make sure I'm

00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:57,600
delineating very very firmly between

00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:01,350
social networking which is you and me

00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:04,500
talking and social media which is us

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:08,010
following a group media is about

00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:11,790
broadcast where networking is about our

00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:15,660
interaction together by separating those

00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:18,270
two we can have a better qualification

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,000
of roles if you're by nature following a

00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:23,220
public broadcast you know there there

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,170
are some societal norms and laws you

00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,590
have to follow and you're doing it in

00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,330
the open so there's no private I mean

00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:35,070
privacy is your your saying it out on

00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:40,160
the street but when you start melding an

00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:42,750
individual voice into a media platform

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,750
you now have companies that give very

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:50,280
spooked by their public image when they

00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:54,590
have individual people in the same

00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,590
context as their PR image

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,760
we actually when you get to see the

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,980
archives I I don't see the gentlemen

00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,470
here they had a talk over in the Linode

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,380
room earlier in the weekend here where

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:18,310
he was talking specifically on that to

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:20,170
decentralized media go back in the

00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,570
program I think it is actually called

00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:26,880
decentralized media and he went over how

00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:31,570
to set up your own decentralized

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,690
podcasts video cast stuff like that yes

00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,690
sir

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:19,980
but the cool thing is you are a

00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:27,450
carpenter help build their house oh and

00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:30,060
that's valid that that is valid in but

00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:34,170
but the other example is a couple weeks

00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,820
ago my son and I were at a park and some

00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,130
teenagers had been there in a night

00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,690
before and we're entertaining themselves

00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:43,470
so there was a lot of litter on the

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,120
ground there was another disgusted

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:46,980
parent there and I told my son well

00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,840
let's go pick it up and the other parent

00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,880
was like what why I mean we're just

00:42:48,840 --> 00:43:01,640
going somewhere else I said well if we

00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:04,850
don't do it who will check on the

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,550
distributed media it's it's mostly

00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:10,980
podcasting YouTube like but they have a

00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:18,200
way for disability following

00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:18,200
monetization that is not yes

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:51,290
okay and I'm sorry you keep crazy you

00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:51,290
can yes sir yes

00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:04,520
no there's not in fact Mark Zuckerberg

00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,470
overrode he had the ability to over

00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,740
wrote I'll override and veto his

00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:12,380
shareholders in the last in one of the

00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,750
last meetings where he basically said no

00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:23,030
I'm not going to change our data

00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:25,670
collection practices they have there is

00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:29,420
absolutely none in fact there is more

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:34,690
money to be made by not federating so

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,690
they cannot be depended on to fix this

00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:53,000
it is but just like that college kid who

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,030
started hacking on this like operating

00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:05,780
system kernel a couple years ago and it

00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:08,360
kind of I don't know yet

00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:11,300
but if you try to help you might figure

00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,610
it out if enough of us are doing this as

00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:17,480
people who can maintain a server space

00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:20,120
safely or write this software we've

00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,940
proven with desktop environments

00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:26,210
operating systems web servers entire

00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:29,750
languages that we can change

00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,350
fundamentally how industry operates so

00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:35,840
why can't we actually do something other

00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:39,160
than making electric scooters and try to

00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,160
make society a little bit better

00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,230
maybe but I think there's you you I

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:18,130
think there's other ways to monetize we

00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:20,640
just we can figure it out but there's

00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,640
value there

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,850
and that's where Federation is helping I

00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,000
mean once you got bit torrent trackers

00:46:50,850 --> 00:47:24,090
it was a lot nicer

00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:26,370
so yes sir I would bring up it's not

00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:29,670
really social social networking but next

00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:32,970
cloud is an awesome alternative to

00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:36,720
Dropbox and it's a great platform but I

00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:39,140
use it extensively yes guy in the end

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,140
and then you

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,170
yes

00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:57,430
I'm conflicted I number one I want I

00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,430
want to take the moral high road of you

00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:04,630
can censor yourself it's but the

00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:07,569
slippery slope comes in and you know I

00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:10,059
the fact that we mix social media and

00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:11,950
social networking I think has gone a

00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:15,750
long way into making this a real

00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:17,700
quagmire and we need to facilitate

00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,220
systems where they can have

00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:23,109
decentralized media and we might have

00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,900
Crawley might have interaction and

00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:29,980
bridges but I I'm not sure I would want

00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:32,049
to have like Johnson and Johnson or

00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,410
General Mills having their own Mastodon

00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:34,410
server

00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:58,290
seeing I think there's some validity in

00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,180
there because you are controlling the

00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,700
installation of an access to that

00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,160
instance so I think there's a way out

00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,720
and I just I guess at the end of the day

00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,230
my message is to you

00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:13,520
hackers developers sis admins who have

00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:15,839
competency in here is you know jump in

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,119
maybe we'll figure this out together

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:21,720
just like we figured out a desktop

00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:24,480
environment a web server languages

00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:28,890
Python I mean we've done things that the

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,849
industry struggles to do on our own just

00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:34,470
for the fun of it

00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:35,670
so wanna give this a crack so I think

00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:45,480
we're out of time but I want to give

00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:47,670
this gentleman second in of chance it's

00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,470
still a little janky but yes and

00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:53,430
actually there's a lot of development

00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:56,760
going into integrating that next clouds

00:50:53,430 --> 00:51:02,299
Federation is more b2b oriented but

00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:05,069
that's not a bad thing it's Parden

00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:06,930
business-to-business like company a

00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:10,430
wants to share a file securely with

00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:13,650
Company B it just so happens that it's

00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:17,569
palatable enough that you can run two or

00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:19,650
three users on it just fine it's

00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:21,030

00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,670
