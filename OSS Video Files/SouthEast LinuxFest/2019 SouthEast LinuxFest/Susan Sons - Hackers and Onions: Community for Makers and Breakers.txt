Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
This is an open session beginning with a 20-minute talk of how the Onion Futures Market came about as a model for making old-school hacker gatherings viable in the modern age.  Following that will be a mini-social hosted by some OFM members.

a change I will not be telling you where

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,540
I work what I do and how fun I think it

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,730
is because this is something I get to do

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,360
entirely in my free time so this is just

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,400
me and I'm going to start out with a

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,520
little story about why I'm doing this

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,990
before I get into how it works and I'm

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,990
starting with what I call the parable of

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,230
the climbing wall a while back some

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,090
friends of mine and I went to a big

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,650
outdoor fair and they had this climbing

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,769
wall and it was a really cool climbing

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,270
wall and instead of just being a

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,890
vertical surface with all these little

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,809
grabbe's like you see in the stock art

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,090
that I pulled this climbing wall had all

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,829
sorts of different surfaces on it and it

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,390
was a different angle so sometimes you

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,510
were climbing you could scramble

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,920
there were places you could stand

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,059
vertical and lateral movement and all

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,379
sorts of different things there were

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,149
even some places to hang from and you

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,039
know it was set up really well they had

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,809
all the people with the liability forms

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,730
and they had you could get a helmet and

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,559
you could get somebody to rope you up so

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,899
that you were absolutely safe in this

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,930
whole thing and they had instructors to

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,680
help you climb the climbing wall and

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,689
people there to make sure there was

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,290
absolutely no screwing around on the

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,939
climbing wall while I was there with my

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,610
buddies from an experimental military

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,770
knife fighting Club and a search and

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,970
rescue team the first thing we wanted to

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,150
do was make sure there was screwing

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,220
around on the climbing wall so we ran

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,990
out and got some of our gear I'm the

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,750
search and rescue medic so I did have my

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,700
medic bag on call just in case um or

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,049
like this thing's over soft grass we all

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,579
know what we're doing we have some

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,650
really experienced climbers and some

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,689
well trained knife fighters so we

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,930
cleared out all the everybody else

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,280
cordon off the area for a little bit and

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,570
got out a bunch of training knives for

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,970
those of you who haven't trained in

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,829
knife fighting you know that a guy is a

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,780
really serious knife fighter when he has

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,030
a box of half used bright red lipstick

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,530
under his bed because you coat the

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,299
training knives with lip sticks so you

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,280
know who's gotten hit and then there we

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,229
were knife fights on the training wall

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,600
because it was the thing to do and it

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,489
was fun and it made you test some skills

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,929
you don't don't normally use coz how

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,420
many people get in a knife fight while

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,440
climbing something not so much outside

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,720
of the movies

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,250
but it was fun and it was interesting

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,810
and there was some risk involved but we

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,120
knew what we were doing and we had a

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,650
medic on hand these are two very

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,140
different ways of looking at the world

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,680
some people want to know nothing will go

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,930
wrong

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,670
some people want that safety they want

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,830
all the forms they want the helmet they

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,150
want to be roped up they want to harness

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,830
they want to know that if they fall

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,570
they'll instantly be caught and they

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,390
don't have to pay any consequences if

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,890
something goes wrong for other people

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,020
that's not a very interesting way to

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,090
live we know that if we constantly

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,100
challenge ourselves if we accept some

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,500
risk if we accept that some things going

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,450
wrong is part of life we plan for the

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,340
fact that some things may go wrong that

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,870
we grow more we learn more and we get to

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,500
do more interesting things and we get

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,970
some interesting stories along the way

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,160
what I'm about to tell you is entirely

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,930
for the second type of person the people

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,200
who absolutely want to screw around on

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,240
the climbing wall we also believe in the

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,130
importance of failure and when I say we

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,330
I'm really starting to talk about hacker

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,830
culture now the onion futures market

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,230
which is the organization I'm going to

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,320
tell you about was named after one hell

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,940
of a failure I don't know how many in

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,720
this group know a lot about financials

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,880
market but the only commodity that it is

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,700
illegal to try it on a futures market in

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:38,010
America is onions since 1958 why you may

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:44,010
ask have we outlawed trading futures on

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:47,610
onions well in 1955 to traders named

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,980
Siegel and kasuga bought 98% of the

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,680
onions in America through futures

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,750
contracts and they did this via the

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,670
Chicago Mercantile Exchange which is

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,270
where most agricultural features are

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,550
traded still today and these guys were a

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,980
little new at this and didn't quite have

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,390
the whole theory down and they said well

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,150
we did this on the Chicago Mercantile

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,190
Exchange so clearly we need to ship all

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,550
the onions to Chicago in order to sell

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,330
them so suddenly a little over 30

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,430
million pounds of onions were in Chicago

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,430
rotting in mountains in shipping yards

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,940
the rest of the country by the way could

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,670
not buy onions so

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,050
no onion rings for you in 1955 if you

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,210
happen to say live in Charlotte North

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,860
Carolina unless you happen to know

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,470
someone who had a really nice garden in

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,340
their backyard you were simply out of

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,080
luck and on top of that these two

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,000
gentlemen realized that their gigantic

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,400
supply of onions was beginning to not

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,800
look so good so they shipped them out of

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,810
Chicago to be cleaned and rebadged and

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,390
shipped back in in the hope that they

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,310
would sell so now people who were

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,540
slightly less observant than one might

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,690
hope they would be thought there were

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,090
twice as many onions in Chicago and the

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,310
price plummeted even further driving the

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,340
price of onions down to ten cents for a

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,440
50-pound bag of onions the people who

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,650
made the bags for the onions went

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,970
bankrupt and lost their businesses

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:18,240
because the price of onions had gone

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,090
down so low and a number of farmers also

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,130
faced financial hardship because the

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,360
future value of onions was now beginning

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,680
to be predicted to be very low and the

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,180
rest of the country just couldn't have

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,780
onions in their soup and couldn't have

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,580
onion rings for about a year Congress

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,260
decided that this was a massive problem

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,780
and we needed to stop this from ever

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,610
happening again probably led I don't

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,890
know the exact history here but I'm I

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,080
firmly believe it started with someone

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,580
who didn't get onions in some dish that

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,300
they really really wanted for about a

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,540
year and they were angry about it

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,210
so in 1958 the onion Futures Act was

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,090
signed into law it banned trading

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,580
futures contracts on onions and on

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,950
motion motion picture box office

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,910
receipts which are not a commodities but

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,230
you you also can't trade futures on the

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:15,180
receipts you would get from having

00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:17,460
movies so yeah that's how we named

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,070
ourselves because we want to point out

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,870
that failure is important um we don't

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,370
believe in overreacting to failure we

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,750
want people to have room to screw up

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,150
because if people don't take the chance

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,220
of screwing up we don't improve we don't

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,050
grow that's a lot of what hacking is

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,669
about we're like okay let's let this

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,560
together and find out if it works we're

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,240
not gonna spend four months theorizing

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,979
we're not gonna spend four months

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,330
finding out if it's perfect we're gonna

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,830
build it and test it and if it's

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,030
terrible we found that out

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,140
about a week and we're gonna throw it

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:49,530
away and we're gonna try something else

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:51,960
hackers at play involve unknowns we tend

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,350
to be people who enjoy experimentation

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,480
and learning and growth and questioning

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,880
things and challenging things and being

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,700
a little irregular there's a lot of

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,340
chaos to be had and unfortunately for us

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,490
this has led in many ways to what I call

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,340
the fall of hacker cons I really love

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,700
self and I love coming back here but

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,210
self is becoming more and more unique as

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,650
time passes it was announced a few

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,870
months ago that this will be Derby

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,330
Khan's last year it's one of my favorite

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,610
InfoSec Khan's out in Louisville but

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,220
unfortunately um some people found some

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:32,400
things to be offended about and there

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,880
was a lot of social media kerfuffle over

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,940
some manufactured drama and some issues

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,000
with vendors and some other fallout and

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,900
the volunteer organizers just decided

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
they weren't going to deal with it

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,900
anymore and I don't blame them they were

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,570
putting a lot of work into that event on

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,320
behalf of the community and they are not

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,110
the first

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,080
I've watched several cons that I truly

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,610
love fall this way in the last few years

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,800
and I started thinking about why does

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,170
this happen and this is the core problem

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,790
as far as I'm concerned there was a time

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,970
when hacker cons were places that

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,770
hackers went away to do our own thing

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,630
but as tech became big business

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,200
we had to involve the rest of the

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:18,120
business so suddenly hacker cons became

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,800
tech cons they became places that

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,200
weren't just for hackers but were also

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,190
for marketing people and management and

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,900
investors and distributors and support

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,580
people and all of these other people

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,920
that we needed to fold in who are not

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,330
from hacker culture and that doesn't

00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,340
mean that they're bad but they came in

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,690
with very different expectations than

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,670
hackers have because frankly we're a

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,880
little irregular guys in case you

00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:46,350
haven't noticed look around the room and

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,790
so mixing our play with our work meant

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,590
that we were bringing in a bunch of

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,090
people who weren't hackers to an

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,180
environment they weren't prepared for

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,330
and possibly didn't even desire that's

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,430
why some of the

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,459
that have been completely unaffected by

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,170
this archons that are run by businesses

00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:04,209
such as the O'Reilly conference series

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,580
it's a great conference series I love it

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:09,250
it's run by a tech publisher that I'm

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,690
sure you've all heard of I really enjoy

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,600
their events but these are definitely

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,160
places where work is done you go in you

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,050
promote your book you talk about a

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,390
technology or using and how it affects

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,399
your business you talk to investors it's

00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,290
that kind of conference on the

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,269
government information security

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,130
conferences and Technology conferences I

00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,110
go to are also equally unaffected

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,829
because we go and it's a place where you

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,440
go to do work so it became very clear

00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,970
that the answer was that things were

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,420
surviving when work and play was

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,250
separate the problem the standout was

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,350
we're losing a lot of spaces for hacker

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:49,060
play so of course we need to give play

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,920
its own space and that's when the idea

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,529
came around to form the onion futures

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,079
market and this is a model I really want

00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,420
to share with others because I believe

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,070
that others can use it so whether any of

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,839
you become interested in our group or

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,089
not this is a model you may be able to

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,279
use for groups of your own and the most

00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,440
important feature here is that our group

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,290
is formed as a private membership club

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,680
this is not a charity and this is not a

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:17,050
company so we don't face the pressures

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,850
that those organizations face and we

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,350
have a structure that's very protective

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,560
of our way of being our way of

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,010
socializing and our way of playing so as

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,740
a company we would have to you know turn

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,270
a profit at some point we would have to

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,610
make our clients and our shareholders

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,120
happy we don't have to do those things

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:40,329
because we're a club as a charity our

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,760
primary purpose is to serve others

00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,260
outside of ourselves and that's a

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,000
problem because a lot of tech

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,310
conferences are actually organized as

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
charities so you can't say we're here

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,510
for our own community because by legal

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,820
definition you're not that's part of

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,110
being a 501c3 is that you're supposed to

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,269
be there for the greater community

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:04,420
around you so here are five things that

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:07,060
we did on the first four are basic

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,130
features of being a 501 C 7 private

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,280
social club under IRS regulations

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,170
America the fifth one is a little bit of

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,540
a hack that I came up with with the help

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,120
of my fellow board members that I call

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,280
the ideological copyleft and it's a way

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
that I really wanted to protect hacker

00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,500
culture and hacker play by using the

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,890
structure that we have so I'm gonna talk

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,080
about each of these in turn and then see

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,590
where we go from there

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,020
the first one is this is about play not

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,490
work and as a matter of fact one of the

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,990
funniest things that I'm waiting for

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,090
this to happen is for someone to say

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,640
you're not being professional and for me

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:51,550
to say but the IRS said I'm not allowed

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:53,350
to be because in the regulations there's

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,940
a URL down here if you want to see it

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,540
for yourself

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,330
in the regulations for a 501 C 7 Club it

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,850
says I quote a social club must be

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,340
organized for pleasure recreation and

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,740
other similar purposes in other words

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,420
the IRS said I cannot be professional I

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,790
am here for pleasure and Recreation this

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,070
second piece an essential earmark of an

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,700
exempt social club is personal contact

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,890
commingling etc the big deal at the end

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm going to come back to later it says

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,360
members must share interests and have a

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,390
common goal directed toward pleasure

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,010
recreation and similar purposes this is

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,060
going to be very important when we get

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,260
to the part about the ideological

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,440
copyleft

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,210
so please remember it both of these come

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,540
from the IRS information on forming

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,890
social clubs but this forms a sort of

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,220
structure that's going to get us where

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:51,070
we want to go the next requirement from

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,500
the IRS is limited membership if you're

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,210
a club you have to have a membership you

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,480
can't just serve everyone out there or

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,980
you're not a club anymore so this is how

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,130
we handled the idea of limited

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,810
membership without saying that you have

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,580
to live in a certain town or have a

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,390
certain profession in order to be

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,460
considered a hacker so you don't have to

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,250
actually join onion futures market to

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,960
come to our events you can attend if you

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,140
are a guest or a family member of a

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,580
member in good standing those guests I'm

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,510
just gonna roll them all up together as

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,360
guests

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,890
need to be invited by a member and if

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,690
there are any attendance fees for an

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,310
event your attendance fees must be paid

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,440
by the member who sponsored you and

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,000
they're responsible for making sure you

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,530
understand the culture you understand

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,650
what you're getting into and maybe

00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,000
showing you around a bit for those of

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,850
you who are interested in really being

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,980
part of this you can apply for

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,530
membership there's a really simple

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,500
application process it gets passed to a

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,660
membership committee for acceptance and

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,470
then you have to agree to subscribe to

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,150
the purposes and goals of OFM l a moment

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,500
on the acronym we found out when we

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,410
incorporated this in the state of

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,790
Indiana onion features market we had to

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,980
pick one of those like corporate words

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,050
to tack on the end and we're just

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,760
looking at what we could be Corp or we

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,770
could be incorporated and I'm like no

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,570
limited and the rest of the board

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,810
members are like why that we're not in

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,210
LLC and I said no look at the acronym

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,710
guys it's limp so yeah we're onion

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:25,630
futures market limited just because I

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,490
like the acronym so you have to agree to

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,350
the purposes and goals and to abide by

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,510
the bylaws that includes paying annual

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,980
dues that's how we support the

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,110
organization I'll get into the financial

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,840
bits in a minute and you have to be over

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,450
18 because according to US law you can't

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,880
agree to belong to a 501 C 7 social club

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,950
if you're under 18 because we allow

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,550
family member gets that shouldn't be an

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,950
issue for anyone

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,870
only regular members get to vote that's

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,930
really important because we don't want

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,220
to suffer from someone showed up and

00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,990
decided to submit a member a placate

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,690
membership application just so that they

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,210
can vote all the hacker activities that

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,950
bother them off the island so in order

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,020
to become a voting member you have to be

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,180
an associate member in stand in good

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,510
standing for more than 16 months and

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,890
show up at two events we're not asking

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,750
for your firstborn child we're not

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,280
asking for a blood donation we just want

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,990
you to stick around enough that we know

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,980
that you care about the organization and

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,280
understand what we're trying to

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,260
accomplish the only special thing that

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,400
you get as a voting member is you can

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,260
vote on who will serve on our

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,940
organizational board and you can help

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,750
ratify changes to the bylaws if we ever

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,240
try to change the bylaws

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,240
so here's another fun IRS requirement

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,209
that I think helps us stay a hacker con

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,519
income must come from members for the

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:50,029
social club to be a social club under

00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:55,639
IRS regulations we have to get all that

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:58,459
six all but 35% so 65% or more of our

00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,009
money directly from our members we can't

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,500
get that money from guests we can't get

00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,569
that money from donors we can't get that

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,850
money from other people so this is

00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:10,339
really a member supported organization

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,740
which is why we have dues but it also

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:14,480
means that we are not beholden to do

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,459
things in a way that keep our donors

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,959
happy we're not tempted to get on that

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,550
gravy train because we are legally

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,269
prohibited from getting on that gravy

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,300
train as a matter of fact um if we ever

00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:28,819
top 15% of our income getting coming

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,800
from the general public we lose our IRS

00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,800
status and we are no longer tax-exempt

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,860
the next big cool feature of a private

00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,629
club and here's something you definitely

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,309
don't get with the charity is member

00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:47,240
privacy many of us have seen

00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:49,120
controversies out there in the tech

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,550
world that can generally be

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,170
characterized as guilt by association

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,120
you hang out with the wrong people you

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,689
read something that says the wrong

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,699
things you are now suspect especially in

00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:04,220
ways that can affect employment if you

00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:06,679
work for the wrong organization I'm very

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,770
lucky I can be very out about Who I am

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,010
and what I do because I happen to work

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,809
for a publicly funded entity that just

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,429
doesn't have the right to screw with me

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:19,250
and actually people who care about

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:22,189
intellectual independence not everyone

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,470
is in that position there is a lot of

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,209
case law and by a lot I mean hundreds of

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,059
years back to the beginning of America

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,510
and before protecting the privacy of

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,950
members of a private social club if

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,830
you're ever wondering why it's really

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,929
hard for someone to go out and subpoena

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,880
the member roles of certain clubs and

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,169
that the Supreme Court's turned it over

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,140
it's because they used a structure like

00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:47,030
this because the Bill of Rights says

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,570
there's a freedom of association and

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,220
that has a

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,350
included that someone can't go out and

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,029
catalogue all your associations we're

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,500
seeing in the tech world this falling

00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,419
down a little bit with social media and

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,730
things because that's a new area of case

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,549
law this is case law that's hundreds of

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,070
years old and that's something I really

00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,559
like so for those of us who are standing

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,809
on the board our names have to be public

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,860
because we're taking financial

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,509
responsibility for the organization we

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,389
are managing the books we're managing

00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,860
the IRS paperwork and we're managing all

00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:18,389
of the governmental interactions

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,019
involved with having the incorporation

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,970
that's currently three people everyone

00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,889
else gets confidentiality part of our

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,139
culture is that we do not record or

00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:30,000
photograph at any of our events if we

00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:31,980
catch someone recording or photographing

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,320
we will eject them and remove them from

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,639
or the organization or bring it up for a

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,409
vote to remove them from the

00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:43,019
organization we intend for people to

00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:45,299
have a space to be themselves to screw

00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,070
up to say the wrong thing and not have

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,320
all the consequences in the world come

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,700
down on their heads

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,370
because even though those events are

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,110
exceedingly rare the fact that they

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,730
happen in the fact that when they happen

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,889
and who they will happen to is extremely

00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,360
unpredictable does cause people to

00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,950
self-censor and I feel that it's

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,039
inhibiting growth in our community in a

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,750
lot of ways so member privacy is very

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,429
near and dear to my heart because I feel

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,490
that it lets people come out of their

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:13,409
shells it lets people experiment and it

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,970
lets people feel like they're allowed to

00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:20,820
be wrong they're allowed to say the

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:24,210
wrong thing so the onion futures market

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,340
mission as an ideological copyleft those

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,870
of you who remember the early days of

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,289
the intellectual property wars on

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,159
software there were a lot of people who

00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,720
saw copyright itself is a great evil

00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,730
because how could you own an idea and

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,580
then there were some people who said

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,029
wait a minute if I own software I can

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,399
license it I can license it in a way

00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:51,000
that ensures that it can be shared

00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:53,730
freely and that's how we got open-source

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,580
licenses and the idea was referred by

00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:00,059
many referred to by many as copyleft

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,799
as opposed to copyright we're doing

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,460
something similar with onion futures

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,800
market by

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,260
laws that I call an ideological copyleft

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,140
if you'll remember from an earlier slide

00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,210
you have to subscribe to a shared goals

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,110
and mission in order to be part of a

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,260
private social club

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,150
that's an IRS requirement so that sounds

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,380
like something that says that we all

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,110
have to think alike which is the

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,260
opposite of what hackers want well we

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,180
managed to turn that around our mission

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,950
statement written into our bylaws says

00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,870
that the onion futures market is a

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,610
private social club for individuals

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,340
interested in future technologies and

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,230
economies and in extreme

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,780
self-improvement and self-reliance it

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,630
goes on to say how this is linked to

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,630
thinking independently that we are open

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,760
to new ideas there is no idea that is

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,590
off-limits for exploration you must

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,930
accept this in order to be a member of

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,780
the onion futures market and you must

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,540
behave consistently with this and any

00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,690
meeting event or online venue that is

00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,320
part of the onion futures market this is

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,840
our ideological copyleft you must accept

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,420
the ideology of not forcing out other

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,050
ideologies in order to be part of this

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,640
group so this is something that we did

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:18,180
to protect our group in our play space

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,190
on a legal and organizational level to

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,780
help make it strong and there are a lot

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,660
of things that we're doing on a cultural

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,460
level if you'll see over here on my list

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,890
I talked about building culture through

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,720
sessions like killing sacred hogs many

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,870
of you have heard the expression killing

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,540
sacred cows it's when you open up and

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,040
criticize an idea that is so sacred that

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,920
you're not supposed to ever talk about

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,500
it or question it we consider this a

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,600
core of our culture so at our upcoming

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,430
event in August one of the things we

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,780
plan to do is to share a meal I'm hoping

00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,200
for a hog roast if we have enough money

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,120
to pull it off and we've rented out an

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,090
amphitheater like literally an outdoor

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:01,680
amphitheater and there's gonna be good

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,300
food hopefully pulled pork and you stand

00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,190
up and you give a five to seven minute

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,500
lightning talk on the most controversial

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,910
topic you can come up with doesn't even

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,070
matter if you believe it you're welcome

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,690
to play devil's advocate and then people

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,060
get to question you for the remainder of

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,160
your 10 minute slot and then you go in

00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,350
the next person

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,420
because one of the first cultural

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,040
attributes that we want to establish is

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,800
there is nothing that is off limit to

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,590
discuss or debate in this environment

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,030
everything is fair game and those are

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,820
the sort of cultural markers that we

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,530
want to set up so as I mentioned our

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,750
first event is coming up this August

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,030
it'll be in a forest in southern

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:41,180
Illinois or southern Indiana god I don't

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,040
want to be in Illinois I like Indiana we

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,100
have a member site up in an online chat

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,560
we currently have three board members we

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,420
have 16 associate members 13 who've

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,480
already on board it online and three

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,520
more who were getting on boarded soon

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,130
our incorporation bylaws and banking are

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,750
done as I get into how can you do this

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,240
process you'll find out that that's a

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,940
really important step

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,980
our 501 C 7 application with the IRS is

00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,390
in progress we are doing this soon

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,860
enough that we get to do the short form

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,050
application so it should be pretty

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,760
straightforward and we're making

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,460
mistakes we're experimenting with things

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,380
you know this is all a work in progress

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,670
but I wanted to share the model because

00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,850
I think this is important and we're

00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:25,610
going to need it going forward because I

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,500
think that we don't always want to be at

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,990
suit con I love suit con I get a lot of

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,970
work done at suit con suit con is kind

00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,440
of my generic term for the business in

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,720
government conferences that I go to

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,230
where I do technology I connect with

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,520
people who will help my work motivations

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,200
and you can make a lot of really cool

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,610
things happen there's people to network

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,460
with there are lots of positive things

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:50,270
but suit con is not for play suit con is

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:52,220
for business and hackers need to play so

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,470
if you've thought about building your

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,110
own here's the recipe and I'll give it

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,580
to you in four steps step one is your

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,440
mission and your founding members and

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,480
you need to think really hard about this

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,670
a lot of people think mission and vision

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,340
statements are very hot pie in the sky

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,900
and fluffy and not that related to

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,540
things that hackers care about well let

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,100
me tell you the opposite is true

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,810
because getting this right means the

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,390
difference between having a cohesive

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,280
group and having a bunch of infighting

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,570
and people who are basically trying to

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,240
wreck each other to get their own way

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,890
your founding members need to be a small

00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,080
group of people who are at least a

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,720
hundred and fifty percent the quality of

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,970
the people you hope to recruit long term

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,789
okay so think about the people that you

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,100
know think about who sets good examples

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,799
for others think about who's easygoing

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,049
and great to be around think about who's

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,649
the person who makes things better when

00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,929
they're there

00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,669
think about who makes you accept new

00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,169
ideas or makes you think about things in

00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,649
a way that you hadn't thought about them

00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,110
before

00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:53,940
those are your founding members and you

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,179
need to agree on a mission statement and

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,429
I'm gonna be really really clear here

00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:01,169
the reason that we wrote the onion

00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,450
futures market mission statement the way

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,009
we did we talked about being interested

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,200
in tech future technologies and

00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:08,609
economies we talked about coming

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,989
together for play we talked about

00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:15,299
radical self-reliance and

00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:18,059
self-improvement sorry I needed the help

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:20,609
in the middle of a talk the reason that

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,179
we did that is if you talk about

00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:26,580
identity in a mission statement what you

00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,859
get is what we call the tyranny of small

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,139
differences the group ends up breaking

00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:35,009
down by figuring out who is the purest

00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:36,419
best identity marker and you end up with

00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,230
a lot of infighting and things break

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:43,139
down when you build a mission around a

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:45,119
value and an endeavor a thing to do and

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:48,450
a guideline for how to know when you're

00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,159
doing it well you succeed so what you

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,769
really want is a mission that is an

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,389
action it's a thing you can do and if

00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:58,529
you're really smart you have both an

00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:00,059
action and equality and that gives you a

00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:03,200
really great mission that people can

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,419
wrap themselves around really long term

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,759
so once you get that settled you need

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:11,549
all of this legal stuff you need to

00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,409
incorporate in the state of Indiana this

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,210
is really simple and I can walk anyone

00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:18,029
who's interested in Indiana through the

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,470
process it's a form that took me about a

00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:21,570
little less than 10 minutes to fill out

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:26,879
after straightening out people who have

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:28,590
hard to spell addresses cost $31 took me

00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:31,259
ten minutes I immediately got a PDF

00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,960
response from the state Illinois is

00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:36,269
pretty expensive it costs over $100 and

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,609
the PDF forms a little more obnoxious

00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:40,109
and they get back to you in a few days I

00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,999
haven't done this in a lot of other

00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,380
states in Delaware you usually have to

00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:46,380
hire a registered agent

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,090
um whatever state you're in learn about

00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,200
your state hopefully your Secretary of

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,020
State's office will have good

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,490
information online once you do the

00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,560
incorporation you're going to need

00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,230
bylaws and bylaws or like the

00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,700
constitution of your organization they

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,800
are not the most important thing to know

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,530
as bylaws are not about the people in

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,720
the organization today because if you

00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,030
did a good job of seeking founding

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,920
members until you all go your separate

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,690
ways the organization is going to run

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,050
well regardless of what kind of crap you

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,690
put on paper pardon my language what the

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,390
bylaws are about is providing a

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,340
structure that will survive the times

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,870
when the best people aren't in charge or

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,270
you don't have enough of the best people

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,250
in charge I don't care what your

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,350
political affiliations are in this room

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,020
but if you think back over the last

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,000
generation or two you will think of

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,550
someone who has been in high political

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,160
office in this country who you think is

00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:44,280
basically Satan we might not agree on

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,100
which one was basically Satan but you

00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,700
can think of at least one and the

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,310
country survived that's what we're going

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,320
for here assume that you will not always

00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,110
have the leadership that you want and

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,090
the organization needs to survive we are

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,010
very willing to share our bylaws with

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,620
new organizations if you'd like that to

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,840
learn from or to use it as an example

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,530
and then just start from that basis and

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,880
then tweak as you go so once you have

00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,070
those things done you'll need a bank

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,440
account um part of the reason that we

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,390
formed a legal entity is you need places

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,240
to meet we needed to rent out this park

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,770
facility since we didn't have the legal

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,710
entity in the banking when we needed to

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,570
reserve what happened was I put two

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,340
thousand dollars into reserving things

00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,070
renting things and paying for things on

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,890
behalf of the organization and I'm

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,180
waiting for people to slowly pay me back

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,700
that's not how you run a group effort

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,800
what we want long-term is a situation

00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,450
where everybody puts in some money and

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,490
the organization can take care of these

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,620
things on behalf of the group that's why

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,320
we form a legal entity because it can

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,560
rent out event space it can buy supplies

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:56,850
that can do things that we need and also

00:28:52,560 --> 00:29:00,150
it gives us that nice privacy right so

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,470
getting that together um I will say that

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,960
I have in the past run a nonprofit

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,820
organization where someone chose a tiny

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,740
local bank that only existed in their

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,470
suburb

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:13,320
it caused years of negative fallout for

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:17,310
that organization because this is a

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,740
volunteer endeavor this volunteer

00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,660
endeavor will see personnel turnover and

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,700
they will not all live in that one tiny

00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,310
suburb that has that tiny one branch

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,310
bank I'm not going to tell you which

00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,800
bank to choose but the qualifiers you're

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,840
looking for are the bank is well set up

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,670
to do remote transactions they can

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,370
handle a lot of the interaction with the

00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,560
bank not happening in person and the

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,510
bank has enough branches that throughout

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,230
the life of the organization and its

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,000
personnel turnover you're not likely to

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,830
have too frequently and by frequently I

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,740
mean more than every ten years or so

00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,450
change banks in order to get branches

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,330
that are close enough to your volunteers

00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,710
that you can do your work effectively

00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,780
because the last thing you want to do is

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,090
force people to stop thinking about

00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,730
hacking and start thinking about bank

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,610
paperwork frequently how many of you

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,320
like bank paperwork raise your hands I

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,720
see zero hands in this room which is

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,810
precisely what I expected so don't make

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,910
that mistake you want really your

00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,770
overhead to be as low as possible and

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,210
administering the organization as you go

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,250
forward because we want to think about

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,230
hacking we want to think about how much

00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,630
liquid nitrogen can I ship into this

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,540
campsite and what can I do with it once

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,790
it's there that's what you want to be

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,780
spending your cycles on not your banking

00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:38,970
problems so after that gets running you

00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,660
want to file your 501 C 7 application

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:45,210
with the IRS this is really important to

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,790
do quickly the speed with which you

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,850
submit that application determines your

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,370
application process the IRS has two

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,960
processes that you might end up in one

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,750
is fairly light and quick and

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,820
predictable the other one involves a

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,790
heck of a lot more paperwork especially

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,590
financial paperwork can involved and can

00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,810
involve an audit it doesn't all the time

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,000
and involves lots of legal

00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,650
back-and-forth with the IRS we don't

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,260
like that heavyweight process

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,360
it sucks the way that you end up in the

00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,630
heavyweight process is by one of two

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,040
means one is having a lot of money there

00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,960
is a certain minimum amount of money

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,580
that you go over and I'm sorry I forgot

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,930
to write the number in my notes but it's

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,360
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:31,110
range if you have that much money when

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,940
you're filing or in the time since the

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,670
organization was founded and you file

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,920
you have to do the heavy process the

00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,960
other thing is time if you wait too many

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:44,010
months between forming the organization

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,620
and filing for your 501 C 7 status you

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:49,770
end up with the heavyweight process so

00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,770
if you do the 501 C 7 early in your

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,660
lifespan when you don't have a lot of

00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,220
money and when you haven't existed for

00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,290
very long you get to do the lightweight

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,360
process which is much less paperwork and

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:03,000
we've already established that hackers

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,650
hate paperwork and I don't think most of

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,200
us like playing with the IRS a whole lot

00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:12,660
either so make it simpler do it early

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,460
and then you go into sustainability mode

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,560
and that's the fun part you know we do

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,410
all of this work which none of us like

00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,570
but we realize is necessary to get to

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,070
here this is where we want to be we want

00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,810
to be at the point where we're having

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,060
great events that make people want to

00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:29,760
come back where we're making connections

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,860
where we are learning new things where

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,860
we're coming up with what demo am I

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,020
going to show off next year where we're

00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,490
talking about hmm can I really start a

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,250
special interest group for lock-picking

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,750
I think we have enough people now that's

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,220
the kind of stuff we want to be spending

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:48,030
our time and focus on in that

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,950
sustainability mode and if you've set

00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,570
your dues levels reasonably so that you

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,580
have enough money to keep the

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,170
organization going but you're not

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,820
basically booting out everyone who

00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:00,060
doesn't make at least you know two

00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:03,360
hundred thousand dollars a year if you

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,250
have a handful of people who are willing

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,920
to really drive your big annual event

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,870
because you really want to to meet the

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,670
IRS requirements of having at least an

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,410
annual member meeting you're going to

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,790
want to have one big central event even

00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,040
if most of your things are done in

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:21,210
smaller events if you have people

00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:24,090
dedicated enough to run that event you

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,480
go your sustainable you do paperwork

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,520
about

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,929
once a year as long as people are

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,790
keeping up the financial books in

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:31,500
between you keep minutes of your

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,870
meetings and you have this really

00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,260
wonderful thing that can last for

00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:39,210
decades and decades um some 501 C 7 s

00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,650
date back to whenever the regulation was

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,570
written and some of them really date

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,610
back hundreds of years before that

00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:47,190
because they were clubs under other

00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,470
legal structures so this is a really

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,210
survivable model or I believe it is and

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:56,700
that's one of the reasons that we picked

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:58,350
it up so thanks you are welcome to get a

00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,090
hold of me in the hallway if you have

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:04,140
questions that you don't want on tape or

00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:06,090
you can grab me via email this is my

conferences so this is getting turned

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:14,580
off basically tomorrow

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,109
um security that engineering just has

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,109
links to some of the other stuff that I

00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:21,210
do but I'm happy to take questions in

00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:23,780
here as well I'd really like to hear

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,780
what people think

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm sorry I couldn't hear you how do you

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,950
join that's a really good one so if you

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,659
want to join onion futures market you

00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,089
need to get sponsored by an existing

00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,460
member I will tell you the Jeremy sands

00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:43,349
who runs this conference and I are on

00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,450
the board so we are very public as being

00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:47,730
existing members you're welcome to

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,159
approach either of us and ask we would

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,349
both love to see some new people there

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,270
are some other onion features market

00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:55,710
members wandering around this conference

00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,710
but I will not out them if they're not

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,599
prepared to out themselves but all you

00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:03,359
need to do is find a member who's

00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,480
willing to sponsor you and you can apply

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,990
for membership so chat around and you'll

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,430
find them feel free to tag me after this

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:15,020
after this event I will be standing in

00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,020
the hallway directly outside the door

00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:34,280
well the paperwork itself really is

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,620
gonna take us we'll be done within the

00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,240
next week or two um it's really pretty

00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,090
simple as far as getting it turned

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,070
around by the IRS we don't know because

00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,480
so few of these are submitted every year

00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,870
that we don't have a lot of data on it

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,420
um they used to be really common in as

00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,490
late as the 50s and 60s and the number

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,080
of applications from what I can tell in

00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,970
there is limited data available has

00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,470
fallen off so I don't really know what

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:04,930
to expect in terms of a timeline we're

00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:04,930
just going with the flow anybody else

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,970
okay so our annual members meeting is

00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,619
going to be in southern Indiana where

00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,960
roughly located outside of Bloomington

00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:24,220
Indiana where we used my home address to

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,880
incorporate just because it was

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,410
convenient however we have set up a

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,050
structure where we can do SIG's or

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,640
special interest groups basically if two

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,619
or three members are interested in doing

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,780
a cig we're gonna give you a cig we

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:40,180
don't have a really high weight process

00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,890
for that and once you have a cig one

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,960
form of cig we expect is going to be a

00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,119
topic based sig like I'm going to start

00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,160
a lock-picking group but another thing

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,650
that we expect is regionals so if

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,710
somebody says I want to start a sig that

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,930
is the North Carolina or Charlotte onion

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,400
futures market chapter we're totally

00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,040
cool with that and then we would start

00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,310
having more Charlotte North Carolina

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,160
events so if you want there to be events

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,390
somewhere that is not Indiana fine you

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
know get me three people who are

00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,780
interested in organizing it become

00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,510
members and we will make sure that you

00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,859
can start a regional and that's really

00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,480
nice because you don't have to go

00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:18,849
through the bylaws the organization

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,520
forming process you can ride on our

00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,710
banking on our 501 C 7 and as long as

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,079
you're willing to take our ideological

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,240
copyleft with you which is something

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,670
that's unique to us and keep that open

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,910
minded behavior and culture we are happy

00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,910
to have you

00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:37,079
anybody else

00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,469
[Music]

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:09,270
so one of the cool things about being

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:14,400
member funded and having dues is our

00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:17,890
expenses and our income scale together

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,170
because if 45 people decide to go make a

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,960
fork they take their dues with them but

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:26,050
they also take 45 people and 45 people's

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,290
dues it scales linearly so we're pretty

00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:33,040
well protected because we don't have any

00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:36,490
financial or organizational incentive to

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,109
benefit from being a particular size so

00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,690
we have no reason to stop people from

00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:42,790
forking we don't have any reputational

00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,500
gains we don't you know if you're

00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,210
looking at software projects there are

00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,339
benefits of scale that you get when

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,140
running a software project that tend to

00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:53,260
make people try to resist Forks

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,329
there are also reputational motivators

00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,069
whereas technically yes you can always

00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:59,170
go start a fork but then who are the

00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:00,970
donors gonna go to because the money's

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,430
not tied to particular members they're

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:06,490
tied to who gets to woo the donors in

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,980
this direction or that um we don't have

00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:11,980
any of those motivations so our attitude

00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,869
is pretty much here's what we're doing

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,609
if you don't like it we will happily

00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:17,109
give you copies of all our paperwork and

00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:19,750
templates so you can go start your own

00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:21,700
in your own way and the voting members

00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,710
get to decide who's on the board and the

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,750
board drives the organization however

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,730
the board cannot unilaterally change the

00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:31,089
bylaws that has to be ratified by the

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,829
voting members so we aim to change the

00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:34,660
structure as little as possible and just

00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:37,900
leave it in place and let people run and

00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:41,619
do their own things we've also kept the

00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:44,290
central o FM L group fairly small and

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:46,089
focused and we count on a lot happening

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,210
and happening in special interest groups

00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:51,970
with the idea that say someone wants to

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,670
do a climbing group which is way outside

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:56,170
of our scope our answer would be

00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,789
that's out of our scope were not

00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,799
maintaining it but if you want to do it

00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:01,150
as a special interest group go for it we

00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,109
just need three people to write down

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,089
their names that they're willing to

00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:07,059
organize it and somebody to be the

00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:11,020
primary so the idea is to be as loosely

00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:12,880
organized and coupled as we can while

00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:15,430
keeping you know the only things that we

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,289
insist on is ideological copyleft and

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:24,760
privacy for members everything else is

00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:26,319
go do your own thing yes it's written

00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,859
into the bylaws which I'm happy to give

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,599
copies of to anybody who's interested

00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,910
basically the board members are

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,180
empowered to do what we call a temporary

00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:39,069
emergency center if we have someone

00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,299
who's for example photographing people

00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,210
without their permission at an event

00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:44,589
would be something that would cause that

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,029
because some people don't want to be

00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:47,230
publicly associated with the group

00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:51,549
especially if they're in a tough

00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:54,910
employment situation then a board member

00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:57,250
can eject them from events and ban them

00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,599
from events from I'm not I don't have

00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,750
the bylaws in front of me I believe it's

00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:05,260
a 72-hour period and then it's put to a

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:09,789
vote of the full board and the full

00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:11,829
board can remove them and if someone is

00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:14,740
removed by the full board they have to

00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:16,569
be voted back in by I believe it's a

00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,220
supermajority of the board if they get

00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:20,470
if they wish to apply for membership

00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,809
again they can't just come back in via

00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,940
the membership committee the membership

00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:26,740
committee consists of at least one board

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,180
member but is typically members who have

00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,150
volunteered to help check out new

00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,829
members so the idea is to rotate that so

00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,579
that you know nobody has to do it too

00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:35,579
much because it's work

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:27,010
yes but 501 C eights are like a

00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:29,240
religious 501 C 7 basically right yeah

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:33,230
yeah we're a little more chaotic than a

00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,480
lot of things and as a matter of fact

00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,430
when the the hilarity of the board

00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,040
meetings when we were choosing a voting

00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:41,870
system for the board members was kind of

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,090
terrifying because all of three of us

00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:48,980
are electoral geeks and one's a

00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:51,710
cryptographer so that I as the person

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,240
who's also a social engineer and crisis

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,030
communicator and has the psych

00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,850
background I'm going this is awesome but

00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,350
no you cannot inflict this on people

00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,940
scale it down scale it down and I was

00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:14,980
the one forcing people to scale it down

00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:14,980
until it was completely sane but yep

00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,640
you're not paranoid if they might really

00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,640
be out to get you

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,300
yeah and that's really why we try to do

00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,910
so I personally do not subscribe to the

00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,910
idea that we can through some structured

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,500
drum out human bias humans are biased

00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,920
creatures I'm biased against all sorts

00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:59,750
of stuff I'm biased against nine

00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,370
millimeter bullets because I grew up on

00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,560
the south side of Chicago and I have

00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,580
seen so many people die from

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,100
overpenetration

00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:10,400
because somebody in the next trailer

00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,020
over to where a kid was playing had a

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,670
fight with the cops and the cops bullet

00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,450
over penetrated and a kid died or

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,460
something like that

00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,290
I just won't carry 9 millimeter that's a

00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,080
bias it's not fair there are plenty of

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:24,760
cases when carrying 9-millimeter is

00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,680
pretty reasonable but I don't like it

00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,590
so instead of trying to pretend that we

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,360
can create correct human bias we try to

00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,860
have enough people involved that

00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,660
somebody's gonna raise their hand and

00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,940
say wait a minute this is stupid we're

00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,070
not doing this guys and I think that

00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,570
that's where a lot of organizations run

00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,830
wrong and where we're a little safer

00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,210
because we have that explicit

00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:46,450
ideological copyleft

00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,050
is we have a culture that says

00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,230
everyone's allowed to question

00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,970
everything I have been in a lot of

00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,950
organizations that went horribly wrong

00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,690
because no one was willing to say wait a

00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,530
minute this is stupid I don't care if

00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,430
you're in authority

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:03,170
this is stupid don't do that and part of

00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,750
why I wanted an organization like this

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,550
to exist is we have too much of the

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,150
world telling the people to sit down and

00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,890
shut up

00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,870
we need a place for those of us who

00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:16,220
aren't going to I expect more of the

00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:17,810
people in this group and when we're not

00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,300
in the middle of a talk I could tell you

00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:22,310
some stories about that someday but it's

00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,170
a behavior I want to encourage people

00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,160
the challenge ideas including mine tell

00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:28,090
me when I'm being stupid

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,090
that's my safety net

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:42,080
I think I'm biased against both I don't

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,080
like 9-millimeter or poor marksmanship

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:04,140
so currently we have three board members

00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,090
I'm the president of the board which

00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,460
means I have no real power but I get to

00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:10,320
try to inspire people and I have to

00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,990
organize the meeting and tell people you

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,020
know hey it's your turn to talk our

00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:18,420
treasurer is Daniel franca who is he's

00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,619
the cryptographer I mentioned so he's

00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,960
really bright and awesome and he's

00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:24,390
handling a bunch of the money stuff our

00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,840
secretary is Jeremy sands who most of

00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,550
you here itself should know by now he's

00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,310
the one who walks around with my very

00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:37,500
favorite staff member you know the furry

00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:40,109
one so we are the board in total

00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,780
currently at our board meeting or at our

00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:44,369
membership meeting in August we're

00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,770
hoping to vote in two to three more

00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:48,570
board members we started out pretty

00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,430
light just because after derbycon

00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,530
announced its shutdown we really wanted

00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:55,830
to get formed and start the 501 C 7

00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,600
process our hope is to end up with seven

00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,520
to nine board members pretty soon but

00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,720
make sure that people's terms aren't all

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,720
expiring at the same time

00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,110
yep I get to inspire people and try to

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,690
make them take turns talking that is my

00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:48,180
power that is a longer discussion than

00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:50,720
we have time for right now any other

00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,720
questions

00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,910
that's a great question and I'm going to

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,610
try to repeat it succinctly because deep

00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:34,440
voices in the corner are hard to hear

00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,090
there is a situation that can happen and

00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,050
we've seen it in at least one prominent

00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:41,910
nonprofit where we have an activist

00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,380
board where a few new people get voted

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,990
in they take control of the group's

00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:49,050
board and start doing something that is

00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:51,570
contrary to the board's stated mission

00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:54,440
or the organization's stated mission and

00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:56,670
they haven't been ousted because while

00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,430
nominally there are enough voting

00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:01,560
members of the organization to get rid

00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,730
of this problem most of them are

00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,290
disconnected enough from the

00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,630
organization that they don't really know

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:09,480
what's going on or they haven't ever

00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:11,580
really voted this typically happens in

00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,770
large nonprofits where your membership

00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:16,790
is the total of all the people who have

00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,990
ever donated us more than five dollars

00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:21,870
which gets you into a lot of trouble

00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,580
because your donors may not know a lot

00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:25,950
about the organization other than an ad

00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:28,200
they saw that moved them to donate some

00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:31,590
small amount of money and then you have

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,240
a very large quorum you have a large

00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,130
number of members that are required to

00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,010
vote to do anything and you can't get

00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:39,780
enough members together to do anything

00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:42,150
so we worked around this in our bylaws

00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,920
in a few different ways and I'm running

00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,770
short on time so I'm going to try to do

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,390
a brief description but again see me for

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:52,830
a copy of the bylaws if you want details

00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:54,270
on how we worked around this so first of

00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,280
all we were very careful about who

00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,900
becomes a voting member everyone who

00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,670
comes to our events that's not our

00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,200
voting membership our voting membership

00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,510
are people who are involved enough

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,880
they've been a member in some way for at

00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:08,820
least 16 months and they've shown up to

00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,960
at least two events and this is really

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,700
important because we believe that

00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,140
showing up in person is a sign that

00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,530
you're actually engaged with what's

00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,990
going on the next thing is well there is

00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:23,880
a minimum quorum and quorum requirement

00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:27,900
in numbers for most votes of the

00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,730
membership for the annual member meeting

00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,010
which is special it happens once per

00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,420
year it's usually gonna be southern

00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,630
Indiana because that's where we're

00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,299
primarily located

00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:39,670
we have some special things there first

00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:41,589
of all for that meeting you do not need

00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,140
to notify us very far ahead of time if

00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:46,749
you want to vote remotely if it's a

00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,369
small meeting or a last-minute special

00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,259
meeting you're going to have to notify

00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,359
us further in advance if you want to

00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:53,499
vote remotely just to ease the burden on

00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:56,710
the people who are actually doing the

00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:58,569
paperwork we will have remote voting

00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,519
setup for anyone who needs it for that

00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:03,309
meeting

00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:05,109
additionally quorum for that particular

00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:08,829
meeting is everyone who bothers to vote

00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:11,789
regardless of the number so if we have

00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:15,519
ballooned at that point to 300 members

00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:17,289
but it's been a while and 200 of those

00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,809
members have stopped showing up a

00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:21,220
hundred members can in fact constitute a

00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:24,190
quorum and house two board member who's

00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,930
out of control so that's something

00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,239
that's really important because we

00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:30,309
didn't want a situation where because

00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:33,130
some members stopped paying attention to

00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:34,599
the organization there's no way to do

00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:36,460
anything about an out of control board

00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,140
because you guys are supposed to tell us

00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,369
when we're I mean our membership is

00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,089
supposed to tell us when we're being

00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:44,319
stupid and I do not by any means think

00:51:43,089 --> 00:51:47,219
that I'm not gonna be the one who's

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,219
being stupid one day

00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:22,990
good observation were actually modeled

00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,990
off the Kaos computing Club in Berlin

00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:31,280
it is and we we had to do some work to

00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,390
fit it into an American law context but

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,390
I think we've done a good job of that

00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,930
anything else before I shut this down

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,230
and make room for the next speaker to

00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,230
set up

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,940
there are definitely disadvantages to a

00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,950
501 C 7 I'm going to tell you what they

00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,829
are but I firmly believe that all of

00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:06,680
them we have chosen not to care about

00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:10,279
for this use case one is you can't take

00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,930
in big donor money you don't get to sell

00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:14,599
advertising you don't get to do those

00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,579
things that 501 C 3s frequently do to

00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:19,400
bolster their funds you really are up to

00:53:16,579 --> 00:53:21,979
funding yourself we've decided that

00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,539
that's a good thing in our in our case

00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:25,400
because it keeps us honest it keeps us

00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:28,489
focused on our member needs not outside

00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,960
donor needs but we just can't count on

00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:32,779
money that doesn't come from our members

00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,519
because if that ever becomes more than

00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:36,799
35 percent of our income

00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:38,630
we're dissolved we're done the IRS has

00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:40,969
no more to hear from us we lose our

00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:44,809
status so that's a big disadvantage

00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:46,489
monetarily another disadvantage is that

00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:49,009
very few people in the u.s. at this

00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,200
point understand 501 C 7 s they haven't

00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:53,150
been introduced to them before so we

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,529
have a big educational burden every time

00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,150
we meet new people and want to help them

00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:59,779
understand what the organization is and

00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:03,440
what it does um we are tax exempt like

00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:05,690
other 501 C whatever's but even having

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,779
groups accept your paperwork I've heard

00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,969
from a friend on another 501 C 7 he

00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:13,339
often has to do some education and say

00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:14,839
no I realize we're not a 501 C 3 that's

00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:16,880
what you're used to seeing but yes we're

00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:18,819
still tax exempt you need to take my

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,200
paperwork and let me be tax exempt

00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:22,549
there's a lot of Education that goes on

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,960
around that because it's a rarer

00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:32,329
structure today so those are the big two

00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:34,910
I'd say the final one is 501 C 3s

00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:36,380
are because in part they're more

00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:38,660
familiar and because there's this idea

00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,489
that charities are out to help people

00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,339
and other groups aren't I think that

00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:45,799
charities are more favorably viewed

00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:48,619
widely so you get a lot of helping hands

00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:50,299
um if we were a 501 C 3 there are a lot

00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:53,019
of organizations that would just let us

00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:56,059
use certain resources at a lower rate

00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:59,450
just pay less that's not open to 501 C 7

00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:01,670
s and I mean we are very member focused

00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,200
I can argue about the impact I think

00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,940
this has on the world I think we all

00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,829
become better and more better - we're

00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,369
better workers better neighbors a lot of

00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:10,700
better things

00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:12,859
for having been part of this group it's

00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,269
frequently not seen that way and we do

00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:18,799
pay higher rates for a lot of things

00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:20,720
we've decided it's worth it so okay I'm

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,400
gonna wrap up here because we're about

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,569
four minutes till the next speaker needs

00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,440
to come in but I'll be out in the

00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:28,150
hallway if anyone has additional

00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,150
