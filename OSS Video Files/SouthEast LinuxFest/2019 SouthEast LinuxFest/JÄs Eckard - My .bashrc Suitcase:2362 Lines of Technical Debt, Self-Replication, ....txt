Over my many years of using Bash, I've developed habits, found hacks, and accumulated a massive .bashrc .  But I find I can't live without it, so I have customized it to be able to send to every system I touch, even ancient ones.  Come to this talk to discover my weird Bash preferences, learn some Bash programming (that I don't necessarily recommend you follow), and probably discover something new about Bash/Bash-isms, Vi/Vim, Code Taste/Code Smell, distros, legacy, Screen, Indent, Ssh, Git, and dotfile maintenance.
