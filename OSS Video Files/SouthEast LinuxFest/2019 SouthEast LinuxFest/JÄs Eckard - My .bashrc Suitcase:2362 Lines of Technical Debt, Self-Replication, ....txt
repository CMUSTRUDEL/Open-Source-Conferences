Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
Over my many years of using Bash, I've developed habits, found hacks, and accumulated a massive .bashrc .  But I find I can't live without it, so I have customized it to be able to send to every system I touch, even ancient ones.  Come to this talk to discover my weird Bash preferences, learn some Bash programming (that I don't necessarily recommend you follow), and probably discover something new about Bash/Bash-isms, Vi/Vim, Code Taste/Code Smell, distros, legacy, Screen, Indent, Ssh, Git, and dotfile maintenance.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,700
that's a sign of a good coder right it

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:15,900
is yeah I changed this so let me do an

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:21,240
undo here it was 250 23:52 earlier I'm

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:25,260
sorry 2003 yet so words may be the

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:34,950
things that not for me now here on here

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:38,309
just go with it okay okay so any really

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,180
good talk has got an agenda or a plan or

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,989
a format or or slides this is not a good

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,100
talk so here we go as I pointed out to

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,199
those of you that we're here before it

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,780
started I've got my get lab a my github

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,660
site that I've checked these into please

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,789
feel free to go to that now and and that

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,629
way you can give me questions otherwise

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,250
here we go no it's not okay okay so yeah

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,590
let me let me show it to you this is

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,689
what it looks like on get lab and this

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:16,650
is the actual file the HRC Jase and then

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,950
this is it on git hub if I could click

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,470
it the reason I have it on both github

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,540
and get labs because well I'm sure you

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,250
know what happened about a year ago to

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:33,270
get hub and so I'd switch to get lab for

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:37,229
reasons and so and actually you know I

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,810
like it a lot oh truck yeah truck is a

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,869
course that's my my handle my nickname

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,280
my online presence I named my truck

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:49,649
truck so I adopted truck as my handle my

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,759
name my truck's name is truck chuck

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,020
truck in fact yeah so that's easy way

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,320
for me okay so anyway

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,460
goofy okay here we are so this is my

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,320
bash RC again I have no agenda if you

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,440
have questions something looks really

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:13,010
strange on here just let me know so I

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:18,170
learned C programming in 90

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:22,370
- so this is very seeing like who in

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,340
here was born after 1990 - okay so I've

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,530
been writing in C before since you've

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,330
been born since you've been like now who

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,849
here learn just for curiosity who

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,080
learned to see before that time 90 - oh

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,910
wow

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,060
fantastic we do have some old timers in

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,410
here all right so um yeah so I'm a

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,829
little embarrassed to say but this is a

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,599
ridiculously long thing that I've

00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:48,019
accumulated as I'm sure anyone in this

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:52,220
room has but all right so go back to the

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:56,060
C program the rear as a C programmer my

00:02:52,220 --> 00:03:01,040
style of writing code is very C like so

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:05,090
in in this case I've got my variables at

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:10,400
the top my my global variables at the

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:14,269
top here so you know as a good C program

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,690
would be then I've got my functions

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:19,040
being defined before I call my main

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,419
which is down here at the bottom and in

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,609
bash you don't have to have a main

00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,370
program it's just it starts right so

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:28,400
right here is where all the functions

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,419
are called alright so the first thing I

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,810
do of course is parse the arguments now

00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:37,910
now normally in a bash RC do I need to

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,130
explain what a bash RC file is anyone

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:47,989
here that not any idea what what I'm

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:54,530
what this is honestly new guys yeah okay

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:56,319
good that's a good question yeah that's

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,299
a good question um

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:06,760
so as I understand it match RC is is is

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:11,469
called by it yes so the bash profile is

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,049
is for a login SS aging into or logging

00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,419
into a machine for the first time or the

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,900
most recent time the bash RC is for the

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:24,460
next shell inside that if am I correct

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,850
in that is that kind of the right thank

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,680
you

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,240
profile is only once per session said

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,310
the gentleman who was over here

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:48,699
somewhere I heard phantom voice thank

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:51,550
you okay so the difference between the

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:55,870
my personal bash RC or your personal

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:59,830
bash RC and the global distribution well

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,150
so a well I guess it's kind of it seems

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,310
to me a little obvious but the one

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,919
that's put there by the distribution and

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,039
is in the Etsy directory or wherever

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,199
they decided to put it is is the one

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,659
that's they assume that is the defaults

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,310
for everyone the the best settings for

00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:18,460
this distribution or this operating

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,789
system or whatever and then those are

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,440
called first and then your local bash RC

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:29,979
and again it starts with a dot bash RC

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:35,639
and it's I think RC stands either for

00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:38,289
resource or run commands run calm right

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,889
multix had a shell called run comm right

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:43,780
and plan nine inherited the default

00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,830
shell as our seeds the run comm is that

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,320
right like that

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,130
anyway something like that I think now

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,810
people call it resource file but anyway

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,530
and what you do with the bash RC is you

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:59,800
put in your SC bash RC that's where your

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,680
up your distribution says we declare

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,380
that these are what you want in your

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,139
local dot bash RC in your home directory

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,990
these are when bash starts up it looks

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,400
in those gets the ones from the

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,080
tribution or the operating system and

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,680
then it calls yours so yours are done

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,210
last which in my case and probably our

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,770
case you're going to clobber all the

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,670
stupid things that da pranks the stored

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:26,190
industry it which you will see here or

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,160
add settings to it or that sort of thing

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,100
now normally in a batch RC you just put

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,440
in settings that are for bash variables

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,010
that are going to be in your your bash

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,180
session that sort of thing because I've

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,180
been using this for years I went a

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,440
little overboard with that and did a lot

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,460
more and if you look at the and we get

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,090
to the top of the file here I've

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,430
included even a bang bin bash now you

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,370
don't normally do that for a bash RC you

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,320
do that for a Vash program well the

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,420
thing is I've been using this for so

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:06,120
long and I've got special thingies so

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,970
that I this bash RC is actually a

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,410
program to and when I give it when I

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,930
call it with the Inc Inc inker arguments

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,820
it'll increment this file name when I

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:23,310
call it with the MUC profile it'll

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:26,870
create a make bash bash profile on your

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,950
profile file and then the Batchelor see

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,190
uninstall installs all the files that

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:37,260
this file installs so with this file I

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,500
can install it with this bash RC file it

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,770
installs files but with if I call this

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,510
batch RT as a program and give it the

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,720
uninstall it will uninstall the files

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:53,730
that it installs yeah okay so everybody

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,910
know I do not I do not want to say that

00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:03,240
again I heard a question I think did I

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:08,970
know ok maybe I should have this up here

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:10,920
how about that ok ok oh ok so any

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:17,570
questions with anything really strange

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,570
about why did I do that that way yeah

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,750
yes I've got that further down here if

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,060
you want you out since since you mention

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,180
that let's go down to that doctor that

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,700
uh where is that Bosch settings how

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,930
about that

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,600
there we go so I got several years ago

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,880
when I was showing off Bosch how to

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,200
program in Bosch and use Bosch a my

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,750
Linux users group and you know saying

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,970
how I love VI and use VI and that sort

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,990
of thing and then I don't know what I

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,790
was doing but there was some sort of

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,040
frustration I was having with the batch

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,020
command line something and I was like

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,120
all the Emacs bindings I just can't get

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,420
it he said well why don't you use the VI

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,430
bindings now when there are VI bindings

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,310
for bash so that's my first one right

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,730
there set - Oh VI what you can do then

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:18,100
on the command line is now bash

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,480
if you hit a so it's almond

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,120
automatically in insert mode because

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,710
that makes sense right you're

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,220
automatically an insert mode and you can

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:31,420
use your normal not all of them but some

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,820
VI bindings use B to go back a word go

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,790
you know forward and back and you know

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,460
change word you know it's it's actually

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,220
really cool and in fact another one if

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,860
you do escape and then you do V it

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,720
launches your command line in VI so that

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,240
you can edit your command line and then

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,700
when you write quit that's what gets

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,350
executed I do this a lot for lists of

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,480
things like yeah I want to do this

00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:01,240
command on multiple multiple machines I

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,580
so I used salt a lot so I get a list

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,400
from salt of the machines that I want to

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,590
apply I click clear out the the name the

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,620
proper names of them put them in a salt

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:14,170
command you know do join join join join

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,810
join join so it's one long line and it's

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,080
a salt command - and then I hit ZZ and

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,690
it's running that command so I don't do

00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,190
I should I'm straight well I can't can't

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,960
demonstrate that maybe I can demonstrate

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,550
that I mean no I can't demonstrate that

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,760
cuz I don't have salt running but anyway

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,760
yes

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,790
yeah if I remember correctly set Oh is

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:45,449
options for buying by Bosch

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:52,980
sorry it's or is it it is usually Emacs

00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:55,439
bindings so if you're if you're familiar

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,379
with using Emacs then your you're

00:10:55,439 --> 00:11:00,269
very comfortable on the bash command

00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:17,579
line and you can go about and do the

00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:21,509
similar things yeah yeah yeah like if

00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:24,829
like say by default it see maxy maxy

00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:29,759
so yeah so these are some of my settings

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:32,069
check window size spelling on CD that

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,750
sort of thing I'm not going to go

00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:37,430
through this whole thing because we will

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,430
be here for several hours yes sir ah

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:55,639
I have accommodated for that in this

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:58,559
because if I go to yeah so one of the

00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:04,970
functions I've got in here it's my

00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:09,269
Allison I've got here is detect distro

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:12,029
okay and that's there so I go through

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,910
here it's one of the first functions

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,699
that are called and it checks for things

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,290
like it's your Red Hat release well that

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:21,179
means it's a redhead distro well it's

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,300
also it might also be CentOS or Oracle

00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:27,179
so I you know dude sorts of things and

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:30,329
you know that they they have the clear

00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,920
command at the end of my session which I

00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:35,879
hate because I like to see what I used

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,110
to do so I called it D and they also

00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:42,420
have a RM - I and the cpi-m VI in the

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,850
bash RC the Etsy bash RC like you

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,770
- which drives me nuts because I don't

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,940
want to be asked if I wanted to be asked

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,160
I wouldn't be using Linux I would be

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,700
using a Windows look are you sure yes No

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,970
all right so uh by the way the opinions

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,610
viewed tonight are not necessarily those

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,700
south east west or anyone any there with

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:06,560
any sanity for the matter so but yes so

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,270
and in fact uh so Susa I installed a new

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,790
leap 15 the other day and I found out

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:15,410
that the distro wasn't right so I had to

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,720
add this Susa brand that's new to me

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:22,290
about how openSUSE does things so that's

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,370
how I know that that distribute is Susa

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,750
so I go through here I've got this

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,150
variable called distro and all caps and

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,970
I accommodate throughout the rest of the

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,070
scripts just say you know if it's this

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,940
distro do this if it's that this you do

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,330
that sort of thing

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:46,880
so do that entry it does not answer your

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:46,880
question I don't have network access

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:16,640
right right

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:30,880
what that's that's true that's true so

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,800
the first thing that I do is I change my

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:38,020
shell and the next thing that I do if I

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,290
don't have network access I I guess I

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,670
sneakernet it to this machine that

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,600
doesn't answer your question I know but

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,850
there's you know if if that's my problem

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,080
then this is not gonna solve that sort

00:14:48,850 --> 00:15:14,080
of thing I don't think I mean there

00:14:50,080 --> 00:15:16,690
might be a way to do that because yeah

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,720
yeah so you should use and whatever the

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,490
distro decided you want to use as the

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,920
settings which is you know completely

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:27,610
valid but I've got a mechanism inside

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,500
here to do - - SSA every time so in fact

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:43,210
let me go to that yes yes yes yes I'm

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:45,790
sorry okay yes and I think this was it

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,720
bash that first started doing it but so

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:53,050
backticks are substitute the output of

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,300
this command as you know and dollar sign

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,840
paren for in does the same thing

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,630
the difference is backticks you can't

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,970
nest inside of because because once you

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,560
once you have one back tick the next

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,710
back tick is the end of that command

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,740
with dollar sign paren for in you can

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,380
nest inside that so and besides so that

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,150
is a bash ism I think I'm proper in

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,430
thing but there are other shells that

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,530
have since and maybe the best didn't

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,230
invent it but there are a bunch that do

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,520
do that is it is it POSIX okay it's

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,520
POSIX okay so yes sir

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:39,010
that's practice okay

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:43,660
best practice now yes sir subshell does

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:46,210
it not okay it is a subshell

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,510
so take take back take back take is a

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:52,450
subject yes so it's it it I think it in

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:54,760
both cases it forks does that gives that

00:16:52,450 --> 00:17:04,560
standard out of that right and puts that

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:04,560
in as a yes sir to the what oh yes okay

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:26,390
set Mohnish e as air sitting oh oh yeah

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:28,339
yeah okay right so fail yes so in so

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,529
that is kind of a depending on what

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:34,370
you're going to use the program for so

00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:37,190
if you if you want to handle errors then

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,559
never use a set - e but if you're

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,419
debugging it and you want to stop at the

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,990
first time that you crashes I think

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:47,960
that's kind of a so from my mind set

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,820
that she is a temporary setting so said

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,580
it you know while I'm debugging my bash

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,100
script right now do I set dashi and then

00:17:52,580 --> 00:18:02,840
run the thing and then okay so before I

00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:04,929
do that I have to do this and - you I

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:10,220
don't I'm afraid I don't know that one

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:14,029
see again do you referencing an honor to

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:17,659
fine okay okay so yeah again when I give

00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:19,130
talks I learn a lot of stuff so those

00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,039
are other things that I'll have to look

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:39,140
into now yes sir

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:42,020
okay all the time all the time all the

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:46,100
time yes so this is not this is not the

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,140
most stable thing right but what I do

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,860
then is is alright so I don't know if

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,860
you noticed this but it the the name of

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,760
the file is not dot bash RC it is dot

00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:01,490
bash RC chase right so that I can put it

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,830
on any machine and not clobber someone

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,960
else's logging and so if I ever put it

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,149
in the root slash root and and whoever's

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,049
running as root which don't ever do

00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:12,799
don't ever do

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,920
don't ever do don't ever do that but but

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,220
when you do

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,220
or when you have co-workers that do that

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,790
so don't change the dot bash RC that's

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,900
in route right because you're you're

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:31,480
someone else is gonna go ah so what I do

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:35,260
for my user I have the dot bachelor CJ's

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,890
and then I change my bachelor C to call

00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:41,470
that or just similar to it but whenever

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,110
I log in as root

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,390
I just source this file so that way I'm

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,310
not clobbering someone else's whatever

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,800
and it's just a temporary thing during

00:19:48,310 --> 00:20:06,610
the time that I'm using that shell yes

00:19:50,800 --> 00:20:09,850
sir as a matter of fact yeah so yes if

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,740
you go right here yeah all right so we

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,650
were talking about make bash profile

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,660
this this command but if I call this as

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:20,430
as though we're a command and use and

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:24,490
call make profile then it modifies the -

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:28,150
underscore profile but you were asking

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:30,900
about bash RC the the one that's on

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,900
there already

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:53,470
right I see I think right now I do it

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:59,580
manually right now but it could be that

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,580
I don't it's too much power

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,660
alright so so that the the

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:08,320
self-replication aspect of the title

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,570
that I gave here is this alright so so

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,350
just so you know I've got throughout

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,990
this bash RC file and the reason I

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,960
called it the title suitcase is because

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,440
I have all my other RC files all my dot

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,200
files in this file which is why it's two

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,960
thousand three hundred fifty three lines

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,670
long it has all of my other has my VMRC

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,400
it has my gift it has my X in it what

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,320
are the others here less pipe it's got

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,350
also my bin directory

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,750
it's got SSH config it's got these other

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,740
strange words that come up with those my

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:50,650
vim templates Easter eggs oh there's

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,480
tons Easter eggs there's some I was

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,280
looking I was I was preparing for this

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,040
we're preparing I was looking at this

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,690
just an hour to go and I'm like golly I

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,150
thought I got rid of that I didn't

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,270
realize and it's like it'll go on up

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:08,200
here and like did see where is that this

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:10,570
function called see this is the problem

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,090
with having so such a large but it's one

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,640
file that I just copy from one place to

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,620
know there it is next next to the top

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,600
here start gobo does anyone know what

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,880
gobo linux is has anyone ever heard of

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,480
it I don't know if it still exists even

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:29,220
but gobo Linux huh

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,750
yeah so gobo Linux was this idea that

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,930
you can have a distribution of Linux

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,910
inside of Linux or Mac OS or Windows or

00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,850
something like that and and the file

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:43,480
structure is very mawkish right so it's

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:46,540
got programs and the word programs

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,970
instead of size bin which why not and

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,190
you put all the the bins in that all the

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,660
binaries in that director

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:58,650
and so anyway so what made me start

00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:00,450
talking about that I said oh yeah I saw

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,460
it I saw about an hour ago and I'm like

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,650
whoa that's an easter egg easter egg

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,000
thank you yeah and and thank you for

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,410
reminding anytime that I go down a

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,330
rabbit hole and someone wants to bring

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:16,110
me back please be the person that sent

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:18,170
me down there okay so is it okay thank

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,170
you

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,610
so it's so the cool thing about gobo

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,450
linux is not only can you install it on

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,990
hardware as a vm or whatever it's kind

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,580
of pre container containers they you

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,000
could put it in your home directory the

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,220
file structure so you saw that where it

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,500
sits Tildy programs rootless settings

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,840
star gobo is made of the start program

00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,830
so anyway it's a it's a neat idea and I

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,380
liked it for a while there I just

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,970
haven't had petting picked it up I

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,690
picked it back up in a couple years so

00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:02,040
um so any good bash RC me you may have

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:06,920
if you need to change your path you'll

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:09,210
change the the path variable there

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,520
environment variable and that's what I

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:15,060
do here and you see I don't know if you

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,580
can see this at Novell Solaris yeah

00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,880
these are when I was on those things

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,170
however long ago that was these were the

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:28,740
binary directories that I need to add to

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:30,870
my path at the time so anyway in a

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,480
normal bash RC you have environment

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,860
variables if you want to change them

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,400
that's what I do here but it's kind of a

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:44,100
distro based so I got my LS options

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,530
select Solaris and AIX and they kind of

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,910
have bsd-style LS but I still want to

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,230
have a thing I don't know what that

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,770
thing is I think G for BSD is canoe

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,740
style

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:59,250
okay thank you see I'm really glad y'all

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,930
are all here I actually say LS coder I

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,210
actually define Ellis coders but I'd

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:07,740
really stole it from Red Hat so it's

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:10,919
their colors and then you got visual and

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:16,140
editor those are important things I got

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,970
set to VI for my visual but now I'm by

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,390
saying that any questions by the way

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,299
before I go down this rabbit hole

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,340
[Laughter]

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,480
non-existing distributions or Novell

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:34,590
yeah

00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:40,730
well yep so um I've got VI as an alias

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:40,730
to vim for me you see right there what

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,450
yeah yeah it says well right there I've

00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,179
saved

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,360
I've saved 33% of my key bucks right

00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,360
there

00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,770
so yeah that's why it's kind of and

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,240
actually for me it's kind of muscle

00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:05,520
memory I've been using the VI for so

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:09,480
long and went to them but can you do

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,360
that at least into the spacebar that's

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,480
awesome yeah so I've been using the mm

00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,880
as my shortcut to more that saves me 50%

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,700
of my keystrokes but then less came

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,039
along and so now mmm stands for less

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,740
then not obvious but you know that's

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:40,250
what I use

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:40,250
so yes you would be surprised though

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,190
home automation is it's it's just a

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:54,270
matter of what I devote my time to it's

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:57,990
not do I have time but oh so what I

00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,370
actually removed last week the the 10

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,539
lines that I got rid of was where

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:06,500
sea-salt masters I've changed jobs so I

00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:09,510
had hard-coded in here the names of the

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,600
the DNS names of the hosts math assault

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:15,120
masters so I removed that so that saved

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,410
me 10 lines and we have a bunch of salt

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,330
masters so

00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:25,470
I reduced all those two to seven okay

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:29,730
and when interested in my prompt its

00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:32,880
color so I showed you here it is there

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:35,370
it is there's my there it is I don't

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,250
know if the interested in that Jace is

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,860
in orange that's the host name that's

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,520
the time in yellow blue shows the last

00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:47,430
return code purple is an optional one

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,990
that is the branch in get that I'm in

00:27:47,430 --> 00:28:01,230
and then the blue the light blue I guess

00:27:51,990 --> 00:28:04,950
you'd say Siam thank you say n cyan is

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:07,770
the directory I'm currently and and red

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,060
is whether I'm route or not so you can

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,790
see its dollar sign so I'm a regular

00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:17,700
user not pound where it would be a root

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:23,580
user hey why do I choose bash over the

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:25,910
shell you're in wrong talk follow-up

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,910
uh-huh

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:39,740
because the shell is the new hotness

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,740
it's the new shiny yep

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:22,570
really so I uh that's okay that's

00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,520
alright yes so these shells the new

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:28,210
hotness it's got a lot of great features

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:44,560
I have not used and I don't care to and

00:29:28,210 --> 00:30:02,580
that's my opinion and yes sir my top

00:29:44,560 --> 00:30:06,100
five most useful i I don't know man um

00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,400
top five most useful I guess probably

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:14,260
the commands that I use the most are vi

00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:20,170
screen bash ooo

00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:23,710
instead of using SSH now and stim using

00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:28,120
SSH anymore I've got this file that I've

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:31,600
called Jason eyes right so take a guess

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,790
of what Jason eyes does anyone what does

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:40,630
Jason eyes do anyone curious just based

00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:43,690
on its name exactly it it's not only

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,940
does it SSH but it copies this this bash

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,470
RC file puts it over there make sure

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,210
that my environment is set and it does

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,470
the thing and it does and it puts all

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,900
files runs that the wants to make sure

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,900
that it and then SS ages

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,179
so yes so it's a worm

00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:03,520
this is the self-replicating part this

00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:09,330
is the self-replicating part Jason is is

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:19,200
the self-replicating worm part of it sir

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:19,200
yes yeah I know I'm not going to do that

00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,970
[Laughter]

00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:43,450
okay so all right so the answer what why

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,679
is if I'm using salt if I'm this is

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,549
again in the title it says legacy or or

00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,770
something like that so this is what I've

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:54,309
been using but I still use it you know

00:31:50,770 --> 00:32:07,570
so again Jason dies is my replacement

00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:11,470
for SSH and all right so oh yeah well

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:15,970
how would you eyes Jase Jase eyes Jay

00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:19,320
sighs yeah I could do that all right

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,320
so send me a pull request

00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,760
J safai hey there we go

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,870
33% my keystrokes have been saved now oh

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:37,990
[Laughter]

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:40,020
yeah alright so now that I'm in JSON

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,210
eyes and it's probably the longest

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:47,590
function that creates a file I'm gonna

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,090
like discuss how I create files first of

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,890
all start with a comment that has two

00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:54,880
pound signs and the reason I do that is

00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:58,420
in whenever I rewrite my readme I do a

00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,220
grep on carat pound town and in my

00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,160
readme documentation I know all the

00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,940
files that I'm altering right so just

00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:09,370
it'sit's to help me help me so alright

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,510
so uh in this make Jason eyes and of

00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,450
course it's called they're down at the

00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:16,180
bottom so first I check to see if it

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:19,630
doesn't exist if the if the program

00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:21,460
called bin JSON eyes exists or not then

00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,060
I do a here document with the cat you

00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:28,360
know anyone unfamiliar with that

00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:32,650
besides you anyone uh okay so here

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:37,390
document send it to there and then I'll

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:39,730
use my my standard bash style right

00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:43,210
again going back to my C programmer

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:46,810
style it starts with AB and in bash it

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:49,450
it has good comments Mike the created up

00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:52,840
here at the top this is substituted in

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:58,840
the hair document with we go to the

00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:01,300
beginning and created this is this is a

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,370
string that says created by bash RC j

00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,260
socks equals the jayhawks variable which

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,200
is above there which is my version

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:13,110
number which is the date that I last

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:16,780
updated this file I have since become

00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:18,610
more attached to semantic versioning

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,700
anyone know it's to do I need to explain

00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:24,400
semantic versioning okay good

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,320
but this file is it's just used by me so

00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,750
I just put today's date and I put it in

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,790
a sane manner in other words big-endian

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:35,140
so that it can be sorted year-month-day

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:38,950
then I have

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:41,409
put that in the the created variable

00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,179
which is put at the top of all the files

00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,340
that I alter from this point forward

00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:49,480
that I create so that I know that

00:34:45,340 --> 00:35:06,900
whenever I look at this file what Bashar

00:34:49,480 --> 00:35:12,120
CJ's created this file yes sir yeah yeah

00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:14,650
yes I feel like it's either a sinning

00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:18,520
sir glob star thank you

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,770
gob star yeah there it is

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,110
chopped - yes gob star but it's got its

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:28,590
after version for bash for introduced

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,590
using star star to traverse the tree a

00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:55,840
star does anyone know the answer to that

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:58,180
question yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm not sure

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,010
about that having not used it so I can't

00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,580
answer one way or the other I'm sorry

00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:06,240
okay you don't try it all right fine

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:12,580
Ella star tab

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:22,830
it's substituted that's the only non

00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:22,830
hidden file except for title LS star

00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:35,860
so interesting why did it not do title

00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:39,620
since that's really star star and tab

00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,300
read me maybe that's the is at first

00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,770
when i fo betta kaliba 40 capital R

00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,160
before capital T that must be yet it was

00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:55,820
the first one huh this does the first

00:36:46,160 --> 00:37:04,820
 LS capital T star tab title and

00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:07,160
title Tildy now see all right that's the

00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,680
setting that I've got so that I hit tab

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,030
and it just completes I think depending

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,650
on the distribution is whether it will

00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:17,840
be hit until it completes uniquely and

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,350
then list it for me it's the second time

00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,760
I hit tab it'll list so that's one of

00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,590
the settings and it's in here somewhere

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,390
and I don't know what it is off the top

00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,420
my head I've got it in my bash RC so I

00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:37,490
don't have to remember it so the other

00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:41,240
questions yeah yes yes it is no yeah

00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:45,730
it's it's it's big long and colorful and

00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,730
you learn to live with things

00:37:46,630 --> 00:38:00,890
it's very prideful yes I have pride what

00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:02,180
do you not have pride so yeah it yes it

00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,000
can become for sending it hard to read

00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:09,010
but but then I use 80 columns in all my

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,010
shells so you know

00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:21,140
yeah I'll do that

00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:24,170
yes sir a new line yeah a lot of people

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:27,590
do that and in fact I use whenever I am

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:31,670
ever required to be subjected to Windows

00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:34,580
I use cygwin where they changed the

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:36,140
prompt so that it's some description and

00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:45,110
then a new line and then the actual

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:46,700
dollar sign dude you know if I'm gonna

00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:52,820
use the link subsystem why not just use

00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:57,620
Linux okay so yes agreed agreed

00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:00,680
so yeah so I started in the housing new

00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:10,220
kernel so I've I've you know tried not

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:12,610
to use Windows whenever possible so sir

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,610
what

00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:45,310
when eTwinning SS okay yeah yeah we

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:46,660
don't need lettuce cuz whinnies so

00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,480
anyway so I've got this program called

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,560
JSON eyes going back to that and what it

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,620
does does some checks which I actually

00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,010
have in all of my bash scripts because

00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,330
I've got alright I'll go down that

00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:06,040
rathole in a second

00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:07,720
got a usage of course parse args sort of

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,300
thing there

00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,370
oh and so the parse arc is what I do

00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,130
there is is it really is just to pass

00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,260
any SSH flags that I need and pass it to

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,620
the SSH that I do at the end and not to

00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:24,100
the other stuff that I do before what's

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:27,910
the real stuff that it's doing SSH ad if

00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:31,030
it's not running if if I'm so I use SSH

00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:34,470
keys if to say Chad is not running our

00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:38,080
and currently in that shell I run it

00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:42,030
that's ok so check whether I'm using if

00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,590
the other end uses our sink or SCP so I

00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:52,060
SCP if it doesn't and our sink if it

00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:54,910
does and then I probably do other things

00:40:52,060 --> 00:41:00,160
like yeah set up the remote so it's I

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:02,380
set the bash RC to be Jessie J's that

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,650
sort of thing and then there you see it

00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:11,740
the last is actually do the SSH HP port

00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:16,990
- Capital y to the remote yeah so going

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:19,510
to the the format of this JSON eyes file

00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,530
that reminds me that you have a question

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,860
I have to see a question over here

00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,860
somewhere

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,240
and again it's a random way of going

00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,480
about this so if y'all are getting lost

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:44,460
I apologize and you want me to go in a

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:44,460
certain direction please what's that oh

00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,190
okay

00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:06,340
no no because if it's built in and I use

00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:12,790
it it's gonna be incorporated into my

00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:20,200
bachelor see all right now there's no

00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:25,120
need to be mean this right here that's

00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:28,510
been yeah ah okay well that's a good

00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,760
question there let me go up here at the

00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,280
top and you'll see my first comment

00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,520
after the comment of the thing is I use

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,820
a mode line to do folding and the fold

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,740
method that I use is using markers so if

00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,210
you see here version and then you see

00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,970
brace brace brace and then at the bottom

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:51,190
brace close Persico space close price

00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:54,760
easy for me to say and then I do Z close

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:58,480
and as he open Z to because it's a fold

00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:02,680
you know so the clothes closes a fold

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,860
and Z opens the fold 0 Z close so this

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:11,410
is done manually you can also set

00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:13,360
folding to be done based on the file

00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,930
type so if it's a c program if it's a

00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,360
python

00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,710
it knows automatically how what you can

00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,220
fold within you can have folds within

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:27,400
folks like or like other IDs vim is my

00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:28,960
RT ID I'm talking about mode lines and

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,260
this is actually going off in the VI

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,550
there's a there's a recent security

00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,930
vulnerability out on the field know

00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:39,990
about this but don't do this

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:43,080
or update your your your vim which is

00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,430
probably what I'm going to do soon don't

00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:48,620
do the mode line because it's a security

00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:50,370
risk so there's there's a vulnerability

00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:55,260
what do you call it where it's a

00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:59,900
prototype or a what's that you have to

00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:03,270
see me that that created a prototype a

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:07,110
it's something we figured out about but

00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:09,660
anyway so it's a it's it's a text file

00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:12,920
that only has a mode line in it and what

00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:16,680
the mode line does is it is it opens up

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:19,020
netcat to listen and hung as your user

00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,030
and then rewrite the file so that it

00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,310
looks like it's just hello world or

00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,110
whatever it is right so it rewrites the

00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,840
file in this mode line so it does all

00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,550
this stuff including set in the

00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,040
background netcat so don't use mode

00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:36,180
lines or updates them which is what I'm

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:38,520
going to do tomorrow because demo

00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,540
gremlins dictate that I do not update

00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,540
before doing a demo

00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:54,450
yeah I probably should yes yes if it's

00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:57,809
not doing yeah you have to actually open

00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:01,710
the file in VI and noting that that's

00:44:57,809 --> 00:45:03,599
it's also hidden in that if you cat the

00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,700
file you can't see the mode line you can

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:11,849
only see what they've got you to see and

00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:15,710
that's from bash command line ANSI codes

00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:15,710
or something like that I think so it's

00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:25,200
no but I have salt to do that monthly

00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:28,130
automatically so I don't I don't message

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,130
sir

00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:32,339
yes right right

00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,579
well actually must I do have a salt

00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:37,559
state that puts this in my username so

00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:40,589
that I have it so that whenever I ask

00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,510
this 800 so going back to that I don't

00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:44,549
put this on everything because I don't

00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,930
necessarily always SSH to everything I

00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:46,440
don't know again on the shell of

00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:51,150
everything

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,970
I only so I use JSON eyes too onesie

00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:57,500
twosie when I have to SSH into this guy

00:45:53,970 --> 00:46:00,809
so hopefully I never log into production

00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,720
but you know every once awhile I have to

00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:12,809
and then that's when I lay all this junk

00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:15,299
down on it yes sir that's a fantastic

00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:16,890
that's a fantastic suggestion I will

00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:19,980
actually do that tomorrow to check for

00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:21,839
VI otherwise no mode lines because I

00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,980
think that is one of my set Oh crud what

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:36,059
I do that is one of my settings in my VI

00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:41,039
file my vir see where VMRC yes sir let's

00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:45,660
not talk about that please don't please

00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:49,799
don't but you know I know no I do not

00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:52,950
have Keith did this no no I I'm trying

00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:55,140
to be cognizant of the fact that get lab

00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,299
and github are fully viewable and I've

00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,940
published this out so the juglans hidden

00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:03,769
and anyone else who ever wants to you

00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,390
know I run the local Linux users group I

00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:09,480
try to as much as I can now whether I

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:11,309
actually do or not so there's probably

00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,380
there's probably some things in it but

00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:15,210
you know we all do everything right

00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,480
right we're all sanitizing everything

00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,480
yes sir

00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:25,589
yes I live in it's near Spartanburg but

00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,579
it's the Upstate Carolina Linux users

00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:28,640
group we meet in Greenville South

00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,640
Carolina

00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:40,170
absolutely you're in the Upstate yes

00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:41,819
oh yeah I'm sorry salt is saltstack it

00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,640
is a configuration management system

00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:47,359
it's competitive competitors or ansible

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,359
puppet chef

00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:55,730
yeah ansible in salt and puppet in chef

00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:49,670
yeah yeah that's one of the the next one

00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,670
that I want to learn in fact is ansible

00:48:49,700 --> 00:49:04,920
yeah but but but but but if I may

00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,730
redirect this toward me because it's all

00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,340
about me I would suggest learning

00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:13,940
saltstack ansible or puppet or chef

00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:17,610
because these are really the way that

00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:26,760
today to to modernize the what's it

00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:30,570
what's hashey corpse terraform okay all

00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,130
right okay so opinions so well you know

00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:39,450
we all have navels we all have opinions

00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:40,680
and they both stink so um okay so I

00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:46,360
guess I don't really know that much

00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:53,820
about it salt

00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:53,820
you came to my talking his salt but yeah

00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,670
in key mount all you know that's

00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,330
probably one of those things that I was

00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,540
doing a thing at a time

00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:29,020
[Music]

00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,580
yeah oh yeah so it's so it's a way for

00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,890
me to to do my own roll my own

00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:36,570
distribution and I just or whenever

00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:39,610
something crashes and I use a boot a

00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,290
boot disk of some sort then I just you

00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:45,010
know you're gonna bind mount def proc

00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:51,600
sis and they have points and I need to

00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:51,600
update it to sir yeah yeah

00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:56,740
and then Schrute into it

00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,830
Yeah right

00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:31,070
yeah yes so usually what I'm gonna do

00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:33,560
after yeah so the next thing that I'm

00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:38,240
probably gonna do is run grub after this

00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:39,800
after i Trude into and like you'd

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,510
mentioned arch does this I think almost

00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,520
every distribution does something very

00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,620
similar to this they they lay stuff down

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,950
in a directory and then you true into it

00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:59,360
and then have it bootstrap itself yes

00:51:48,950 --> 00:52:01,070
sir no yes it's a decision not the the

00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,940
last part is not necessarily things that

00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:08,360
I recommend yeah let me let me show that

00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,920
again yeah yeah see there and coding

00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:15,200
style that I don't necessarily recommend

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:19,100
so that's yeah yes sir well this one

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:24,740
this is Bodhi Linux yeah what does bode

00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:27,440
Linux huh yeah yeah it's really so so

00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,840
Bodhi Bodhi is they take a boon to and

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,940
put enlightenment on top of it anyone

00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,940
heard of enlightenment remember that I

00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:41,050
absolutely love enlightenment it's my

00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:45,100
window manager of choice probably

00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:45,100
probably is largest yes sir

00:52:52,350 --> 00:53:09,890
I think using I think that depends on

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:09,890
the flags that I give pseudo right

00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:34,290
interactive right right yeah right so

00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:43,620
that's that's a right yeah

00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:45,630
so some yeah interactive pseudo - eyes

00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:57,890
for interactive as though you were

00:53:45,630 --> 00:54:01,170
logged in yeah I I never do pseudo bash

00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:03,960
cuz that's bad

00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,330
okay never never is a strong word I

00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,830
rarely and I tried to avoid using pseudo

00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:16,620
bash pseudo - I - pseudo - I in general

00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:20,720
or that sort of thing but yes right

00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,720
yeah do that yes sir

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,119
Yeah right

00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:31,880
Red Hat for yeah yeah enlightenment so

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,740
yes so my distribution is Bodhi it uses

00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,260
enlightenment as the window manager and

00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:38,420
I love window

00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:41,839
I love enlightenment have loved it for

00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:47,270
years and this is now about twenty 0.20

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:48,520
so you know uh oh yeah so let me show

00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:59,299
you

00:54:48,520 --> 00:55:01,010
alias CP all right well I'm not sure I'm

00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,359
saying Bodhi right either because it's

00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:09,490
an Indian word and it means

00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:14,930
enlightenment it could be both he Bodh i

00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:19,490
Bodh i so it is it's it's an indian word

00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:27,069
that means enlightenment so alright so

00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:27,069
so yeah I a lease CP to our sink because

00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:35,170
and SCP to our sink also so everything

00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:38,210
is as and that goes back to whether

00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:40,670
unless it's running net where in which

00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:43,010
case I don't wanna do that and if I have

00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,380
an hour sink command you know that's

00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:48,849
what are type - P are saying you know

00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,849
whether it's installed on this computer

00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:58,730
yes yes with the - capital P AV yes

00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:02,630
yeah it doesn't recursively because

00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:06,049
that's what the - a is why do I do it

00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:07,670
because I'm nuts I know it's it doesn't

00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:12,020
recursively because which is what I

00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:15,770
assumed anyway I want to do it it's

00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:21,670
fail-proof it'll pick up where I left

00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:30,369
off if something happens yeah now

00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:36,010
I was wondering when you yeah alright so

00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:38,200
that's yes and that reason is if you

00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,539
allow me to say and I now saw it

00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:43,569
whenever I started writing it's it's a C

00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:48,160
habit again and and that's because in C

00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:51,160
when you say variable equals with single

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,769
equals something you're assigning that

00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:59,500
to that but if you put inside an if

00:56:53,769 --> 00:57:01,240
statement variable equals something it

00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,680
will also do that it'll clobber it now

00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,359
in an if statement

00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,970
you're usually wanting to check to see

00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:10,319
if it is equal to which is equal equal

00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:12,250
right so I've gotten into the habit of

00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,589
switching it it does the same thing

00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,630
right so switching it put the constants

00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:39,190
on the left side and put the variables

00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:40,269
on the right side and yeah so it's a

00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,029
style I that I don't necessarily

00:57:40,269 --> 00:57:44,710
recommend so but you'll see it

00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:46,480
throughout the things constants are on

00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:49,509
the left because they're L values

00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,549
they're not L values in C if you know

00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:55,839
anything like that and there are values

00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:57,670
there so on and I put yeah I put our

00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:03,460
values on the left and L values on the

00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:09,269
right in my checks tests yeah yeah I am

00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:09,269
weird to look at it like this yes sir

00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:26,800
right yeah yeah yeah so it's it's a

00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:30,640
again it goes back to why I've been

00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:33,220
doing things not and I'm really glad

00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,099
that no one in here said holy cow your

00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:39,819
indentation is massive because no one

00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:45,160
has said that oh well let me explain why

00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:48,339
that is yeah and that's that goes back

00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,619
to yeah so that's old-school its eight

00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:52,329
eight spaces are a tab and that's

00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:54,520
because the typewriter when you hit the

00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:58,619
tab character Jing it went to the tab

00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:01,619
stop which was eight spaces and which

00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:01,619
