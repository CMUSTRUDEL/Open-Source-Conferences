Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	2019 SouthEast LinuxFest; This talk is really centred around closing some of the easiest soft spots in Linux. Surprisingly very few administrators take advantage of some of the tools in and around the Red Hat ecosystem. Even if you don't work with CentOS, RHEL or Fedora, most of these tools are available to you! USBGuard, SELinux, auditd, aide and luks are some of the technologies introduced and discussed here.

A combination of demonstration and presentation will suite most learning styles. Come out and ask your questions and engage with me!
