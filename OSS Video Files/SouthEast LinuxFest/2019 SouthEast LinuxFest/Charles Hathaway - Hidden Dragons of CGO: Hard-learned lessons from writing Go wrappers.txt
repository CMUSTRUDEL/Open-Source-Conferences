Go ([https://golang.org](https://golang.org)) is a popular language for writing highly concurrent software, and works well when used in isolation.
Using Go alongside software written in other languages (such as C) can be done, but there are some hidden dragons to keep an eye out for.
At YottaDB we've encountered a few of them while writing our wrappers; hopefully we can steer the next adventure on the right path!
