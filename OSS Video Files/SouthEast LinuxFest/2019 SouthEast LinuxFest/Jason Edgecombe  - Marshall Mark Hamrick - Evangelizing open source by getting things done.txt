Getting people to work and play with penguins, camels, snakes and other animals:  
Telling people it is free, and that paid software is the evil doesnâ€™t get people to use open source, especially when things have to get done.   The pain, fun, and lessons of two system administrators that have spread the use of open source software for more than 35 years between them.  We cover the way we have taught individuals and groups.  Discussion of when to start using a open source software, and when to let the package go will be discussed.
