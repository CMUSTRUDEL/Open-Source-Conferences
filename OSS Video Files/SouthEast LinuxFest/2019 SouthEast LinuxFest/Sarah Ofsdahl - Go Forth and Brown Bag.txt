Title: Sarah Ofsdahl - Go Forth and Brown Bag
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
Brown Bags, Lunch and Learns, Study Sessions, whatever you call it, sharing knowledge is essential when it comes to helping your team become efficient. As teams grow and develop into cohesive units, they inevitably adopt specialized tools and processes to address specific needs within their group. 

Effectively passing on and maintaining specific internal or tribal knowledge can and should be done in several ways, but one of the most accessible and straightforward methods are brown bags.
 
While brown bag training is beneficial for a host of reasons, most importantly, brown bags provide a way to tailor training for examples and challenges unique to your teams workload on a day to day basis. 

In this session we'll cover a step-by-step approach for creating and delivering brown bag training focusing on technical subject matter using action-based items.

Topics Include:

    Deciding Your Subject
    Creating Your Agenda
    Providing Specific Examples
    Content Delivery
    Creating both Practice and Reference Material

At the end of this session you'll walk away with a brown bag article template and the motivation to go forth and brown bag.

/ today are at our online so if you want

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:11,160
to sorry follow along um you can browse

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,130
to slide start and supported IO intro to

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,250
brown bags and as I progress through the

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,890
slides it will progress your slides as

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,100
well so just to help everyone stay on

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,250

so I'll just wait a second

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,910
in case someone wants to do that so I

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,760
can not start on time how's everyone

doing thanks for coming out to the last

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,210
talk of the conference mm-hmm

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,390
a lot of people are gone by now cool all

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,980
right well I guess I have to get started

00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:53,940
ok so my name is sorry Sarah off stall

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,039
I am a Linux trainer where I work for

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,670
the Linux system administrators on our

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,719
support floor and my presentation is

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,770
called go forth and Brown Bag so just to

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:12,020
get started here ok we'll start off just

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,250
with some basic sorry some basic

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,150
definition so that we're kind of on the

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,920
same page what is a brown bag brown bag

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,509
kind of gets tossed around a lot it can

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,729
be used in a lot of different contexts

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,590
and mean a lot of different things but

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,840
originally the term was used a reference

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,590
to brown bag lunches which were brought

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,659
often to allow other teammates to state

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,299
on location and kind of learn from each

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:41,579
other just kind of learned Tibbets and

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,369
just little things on the job so they

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,860
were often during lunch breaks the time

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,560
was short the information was specific

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,119
and that's kind of how we will discuss

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,700
the brown bag training that we talked

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:59,369
about today so my in the community in

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,049
the computer moment so I don't know if

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,909
what everyone's background is but I

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,610
think in a lot of the things that we do

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,369
there's always that aha moment of

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,180
something so as a system administrator I

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,470
know for me I learned some early on that

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,170
there are some function

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,510
he was get faculty staff Akal those

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,760
commands and if you're not familiar they

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,770
are commands to manage permissions on

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,530
files but I learned about the

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:29,100
functionality that allows you to take a

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:33,450
backup of a permission structure and

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,370
restore it if needed and to me that was

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,380
a complete game-changer

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,350
it wasn't like that was just

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,150
mind-blowing knowledge but but what it

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,490
did is it kind of changed the way I

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,520
worked when I was troubleshooting issues

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,740
I was much more confident to try a more

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,780
creative or effective solution because I

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,130
wasn't terrified that I was gonna blow

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,850
something away and not be able to take

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,940
it back so just that one little command

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,130
kind of changed the way I worked and

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,580
that's the kind of training that we're

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,930
aiming for when we get brown bags and in

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,910
this context we're looking for that

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,520
training that's just that that tidbit of

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,650
knowledge that really evolves away you

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,410
work without having to be overly complex

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:21,780
or overly general so with that the

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,670
objective specifically we're going to

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,290
cover a step by step guide it's gonna

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,600
walk you through the process of creating

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,880
material and it's going to be focused on

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,350
user story based content and we're going

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,000
to make that content relative to your

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,280
team your specific team or

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,019
organization's day-to-day workflows so

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,570
the other thing about this presentation

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,970
is there is some room for participation

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,739
so I will ask you guys to participate

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,239
and if you could help me out that would

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:50,000
be great so we're not standing up here

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,290
like an idiot Thanks okay so the agenda

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,799
we're gonna start off with an intro into

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,850
what I mean was a user story based we're

00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,410
gonna talk about that kind of mentality

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,480
we're gonna talk about the four steps

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,980
for creating your Brown Bag you're

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,470
establishing scope and subject

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,360
definition outline creation filling in

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,190
action-oriented content providing

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,410
resources and then we'll do a review and

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:17,010
a Q&A so intro to user story based

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,229
content so what exactly is user story

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,239
based what exactly do we mean when we

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:23,490
say this this is actually user story

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,620
base is actually a term that's kind of

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,570
borrowed from agile project management

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,460
if you're familiar with that and this

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,620
definition breaks it down really well if

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,979
you are browsing the slides you have all

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,199
the links and everything but essentially

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,720
they reflect what a particular class of

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,250
user needs and the values to be gained

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,290
so when we're approaching a problem

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,479
instead of looking at the problem from

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,740
the developer's perspective or in our

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,330
case from the trainer's perspective

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,889
we're looking at the problem or the

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:56,680
training from the audience's perspective

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,449
so what exactly does that mean that

00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,770
means that when we talk about the

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:01,300
training that we're gonna create today

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,139
it means that we're talking about

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,350
providing context I don't know about you

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,000
guys but it's really easy for me to

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,090
start something and then halfway through

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,090
be like what the heck was I doing for me

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,830
that's my inbox I'll get three emails

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:22,810
and be like what was I supposed to get

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,030
in here for it's often easy and and the

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,889
the reason why we do something can often

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:31,750
be overlooked but or the want for why

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,700
we're doing something but why we're

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,430
doing something in particular is much

00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:40,110
easier to remember and when we talk

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:43,440
about user stories that kind of

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,000
structure provides a really good

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,000
organization for your thoughts in your

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,919
process so step one establishing scope

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,250
and subject definition with user stories

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:57,450
so specifically there is a user story

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,979
template that makes it really simple

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,599
essentially one of the more popular ones

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,789
there's a lot of them out there as a

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,110
link that I have on there actually goes

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,360
through a few of them but this really

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,840
popular simple one is what we're gonna

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,000
use today

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:16,240
so as a persona I want to sow that so

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,970
essentially as a role I want to do

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:25,210
something so that I can achieve whatever

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:27,340
end goal so a quick note here the

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,979
effectiveness of your Brown Bag will be

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,960
a direct reflection of the quality of

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,539
your topic selection and scope

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,169
definition if you do not spend the time

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,830
to make a quality subject and to really

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,720
define your scope the

00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,910
of training that you make the the

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,670
process from here on out is going to be

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,590
very different than if you had and the

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,410
training is going to be a lot less

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:58,130
effective when you're trying to teach to

00:06:51,410 --> 00:07:00,050
a much broader scope so oftentimes when

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,090
we teach something it's really about

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,550
choosing a particular lens to teach

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,050
through we can't teach through every

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,180
single perspective every single

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,280
situation but what we can do is we can

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,100
focus in on a particular context and a

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,530
particular lens when we try to use more

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,540
than one lens on top of another things

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,830
can get distorted very easily and so we

00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,780
want to do is we want to stay very

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,250
focused and the kind of training that we

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,130
create so let's let's look at an example

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,560
as I said I am a trainer for the Linux

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,410
system administrators on our support

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,380
floor so this is an example written from

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:39,290
my perspective so as a system

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,960
administrator I want to be able to

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,540
verify network connectivity so that I

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,170
can identify and resolve network issues

00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,320
so let's kind of break this down a

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,600
little bit the first part is as a system

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,600
administrator this kind of where I'd

00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,200
like to get your participation um how

00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,610
can we narrow that down is how can

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,590
someone give me an example of something

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,000
that we might put instead of system

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:12,320
administrator that's a little bit more

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,580
focused perfect UNIX when we say system

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,770
administrator that could mean Windows

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,560
that could mean a ton of different

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:23,560
systems but specifically what we're

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,270
talking about is a Linux administrator

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,570
the other thing is that we can narrow it

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,830
down by saying a beginner we can merit

00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,830
we can narrow it down by saying as a

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,720
level 1 administrator as a level 1 Linux

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,910
administrator and what that does is that

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,970
starts to establish your scope you're

00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:44,420
putting out there hey this this content

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,580
is aimed towards a level 1 or beginner

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,900
Linux administrator so you're more than

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,980
welcome to come to this training if

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,630
you're a senior administrator that

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,370
doesn't mean that you can't come it

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,450
doesn't mean that you can't benefit but

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,370
know that the scope

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,290
the training is going to come from this

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,079
place it's going to come from a level

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,910
one perspective and there are different

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:07,880
assumptions that we make with a level

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:10,010
one versus a senior administrator so the

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,339
things that we improved in option 1 for

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,660
option 2 is the target audience and

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:18,740
targeting your audience starts to build

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,760
that scope foundation so let's look at

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,380
the option 2 I want to the original said

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,380
be able to verify network content

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,850
connectivity there are a lot of things

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,829
that we can do to verify a network

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,380
connectivity right we can verify that

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:36,889
the server's up with ping we can verify

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,690
that the hardware is online we can do a

00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,610
lot of things we can check the routing

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,579
tables we can do a lot of things to

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,579
verify whether a network is connected or

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:49,370
not that's a very broad thing so when we

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:53,449
narrow it down to I want to use the

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:57,800
netcat tool to establish a port

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:59,660
connection on a remote server so now

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,190
we've got something very specific we

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,800
have a specific tool that we're going to

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,899
use we have narrowed down the connection

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,550
to a port connection versus like a host

00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:09,769
connection and then we've narrowed it

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,269
down to a remote server versus a host

00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:16,880
server so what that does is that started

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,110
to establish again exactly what we're

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,329
going to talk about because the more

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,220
relevant and specific we make our

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:26,209
training the more effective it is for

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:29,089
someone and then lastly we're going to

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:32,180
talk about the so that so that I can

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,790
verify whether a remote server is

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:40,670
accepting connections on port 80 so we

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:45,260
go from establishing a port connection

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,959
to verifying a specific connection now

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,490
we're now we're talking about accepting

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,260
connections on port 80 and one of the

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,029
reasons that this so that is so

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,069
important is that it's your end goal

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,079
what do you want to be able to do why do

00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,180
you want to be able to establish a port

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,760
connection what does that tell you when

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,949
you use a user story template you really

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,140
start to structure down and hone in on

00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:07,279
why you're doing something and what you

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,220
need to achieve to get

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,540
so we want to talk about port

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,759
connections because we want to verify

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,860
whether connections are open on port 80

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,930
that that could mean a lot of things for

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,120
a website so end-goal when you target

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,720
you begin to target the behavior it's

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:32,089
accepting and then you've provided a use

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:35,569
case activity on port 80 altogether now

00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:38,990
so our final user story would look like

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:41,420
as a level 1 Linux administrator I want

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,279
to use the netcat tool to establish a

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,139
port connection on a remote server so

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,970
that I can verify whether a remote

00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:49,879
server is accepting connections on port

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,430
80 Louisville that sounds like a really

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,980
long sentence I know it doesn't sound

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,779
great I know it sounds like the run on

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,600
of all run ons but we're not trying to

00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,790
win any novel Awards here what we're

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,569
trying to do is be very specific and

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,240
that's what that is

00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:07,430
it's very specific it's targeted it

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,199
tells you exactly what to expect from

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,970
this training and it provides you a

00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:16,850
structured way of approaching the rest

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:21,800
of the material it's all connected

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,899
so like Charlie in this gif all of this

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,230
I cannot stress enough is connected if

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,639
you structure your subject carefully if

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,649
you take the time to invest in this

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,809
stuff it's going to affect the way you

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,550
create your outline it's going to affect

00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:37,959
the kind of content that you put in your

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:41,089
brown bag and it's going to trickle down

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:44,569
actually it's actually going to trickle

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:48,259
down and affect exactly how you do the

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:50,089
rest of your process so with that we're

00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,720
gonna move on to step two creating an

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,949
actionable outline so what are we

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,860
working with what do we have to begin

00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,929
with we have a specific user story based

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,970
subject and we have the foundation of

00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:04,790
our scope so without even creating an

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,740
outline we already know what our subject

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,079
is specifically what our subject is and

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,189
we already know what the foundation of

00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:16,610
our scope is going to look like getting

00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:18,709
started so this getting started as what

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,930
we would get started with if we were

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,790
talking about

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,220
getting started with the first example

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,100
those are the COTS the criteria that we

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,390
have to work with a system administrator

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,910
verifying network connectivity and

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,400
identify and solve network issues if you

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,680
were trying to create training for this

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,000
where would you start

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,860
would you start with Windows would you

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,810
start with Linux what kind of network

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,490
would you talk would you talk about when

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,200
you talk about connectivity would you go

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,120
all the way down to packets would you

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,490
talk about traceroute would you talk

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,650
about ping there's a lot of things that

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,810
you can talk about that scope is so

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:59,270
broad that it gets to be like how do I

00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:03,590
even start this but when we look at our

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:05,510
second example we look at level 1 Linux

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,860
administrator so a beginner we're

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,250
looking at a smaller scope we're looking

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,900
at introductory content what are we

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,030
looking at when as far as I want to

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,700
we're looking at a specific tool we're

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,230
not going to talk about all of the other

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,020
protocols and establishing methods we

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,050
are honing down to the specific tool and

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,460
with that tool that has many functions

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,350
we're going to establish a port

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,640
connection on a remote server and we're

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,410
going to verify whether that remote

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,410
server is accepting connections that

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:40,010
already has a lot more direction than

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:43,310
the last example so your questions not

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,510
only go change from your audience's

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,000
perspective but they change from your

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,520
perspective too so rather than what do I

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,380
include you start to think about what do

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,720
I need to include for my audience to be

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,780
able to accomplish the end goal so now

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,570
it's not what do I need people to know

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,390
it's what do people need to know to

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,430
accomplish the end goal - to meet the

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,030
desired outcome and that's a lot more

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:10,850
approachable and a lot more learn about

00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:13,010
than something as broad as what do I

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,420
include what do people know how do I get

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,040
them to know exactly what I need them to

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,900
know to teach them what I want to teach

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,180
them so when we talk about actual

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,860
actionable outline items what I mean

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,060
when I say actionable is I'm talking

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,400
about things that you can actually

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,220
create an action on so we're not just

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,649
talking about an outline that says

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,420
introduction it starts with and

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,480
traduction sure we can label it that way

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,639
but what we're going to do is in our

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,170
introduction we're going to explain why

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,209
we should do this so that's an

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,819
actionable item I can go through and

00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,399
actually write an explanation on why

00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,740
we're doing it I can actually go and

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,269
look up the internal policies of my own

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,240
company and see how those fit in with

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:57,769
our training we want to create

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,779
actionable outline items so that when we

00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,459
start filling in our content we can

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,399
create our content to be actionable as

00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:06,850
well and so that we can create something

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:11,059
that's going to be relevant as well as

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,499
focused so in this example here I've

00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:14,300
highlighted what we're going to talk

00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:17,480
about in the next slide common flags and

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,300
examples for netcat command and how this

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,509
task fix fits in in the overall scope of

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,490
verifying network connectivity and maybe

00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,639
some things we might do before running

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,899
the netcat command so again your

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,459
questions change you now have a question

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,660
of when you're creating your outline

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:41,300
does 5/1 or does do common flags and

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,709
examples contribute to the overall end

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,509
goal or does it detract from what we're

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:45,920
trying to accomplish that's how you go

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,809
through and you start to weed out all of

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,610
that content you might end up you might

00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,139
start with like a surrealist thing and

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,819
then when you get down to you're like do

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,129
they really need to know this to

00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:55,459
understand how to use net cut no they

00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,980
don't

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,660
yes they do you can make those decisions

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,779
a lot more qualified when you have

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,490
actionable outline items can my read

00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,309
can't my audience a reasonably apply

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,620
content so now you're starting to get a

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,510
feel for in the outline process in the

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,089
outline stage is it's actually possible

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,730
is this all see a radical it can I

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:23,240
actually give something for my audience

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:26,439
to do on a day to day basis so creating

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,760
training fees super overwhelming

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,110
creating something especially for

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,419
someone else when you know the

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,399
complexities of something can be really

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:36,950
really difficult because there's so much

00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:38,690
to include but when you create an

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:42,860
outline there are certain benefits and I

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,770
I get a lot of feedback from people who

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,090
I have create training with me who kind

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,690
of say like well do I have to have an

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,429
out

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,940
I already know what I'm gonna talk about

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:55,160
and I have to tell you that even myself

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,650
sometimes it feels like why am i writing

00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,470
about what I'm going to do but there are

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,720
several significant benefits I've just

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,690
outlined three big ones for you it helps

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,920
you organize your thoughts it's really

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,960
easy to get in the thick of things

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,080
especially on an in-person training and

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,840
just go down a rabbit hole but when you

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,820
have an outline you've organized exactly

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,710
what you want to talk about so when

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,500
someone asks you a question it's not I

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,030
guess we can talk about that it's we can

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,730
talk about that I'm going to I'm gonna

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,380
go over that later or it's that's

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,210
outside the scope of the training that

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,730
way you can actually get across what you

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,970
want to accomplish rather than ending up

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,299
thirty minutes and talking about the

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:40,280
constructs of a packet you can reuse it

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,970
for your presentation agenda

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,600
I feel like an agenda is a lot like an

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,370
AdBlocker

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,380
when you put your agenda at the

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,540
beginning of your presentation you let

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,280
people know what to expect and like an

00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,299
AdBlocker

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,520
when it's working you don't really know

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,169
like maybe someone did have a question

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,280
about what you were going to go over but

00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,750
it was covered the agenda

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:05,330
so now they don't have to ask you or

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:07,669
maybe they they think like oh are you

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,530
going to cover this in detail you can

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,730
say oh it's on the agenda it's the last

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,460
thing we're gonna talk about so it's

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,340
gonna be really quick it really helps

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,530
your audience keep you on track as well

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,809
and then it also solidifies your scope

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,150
so if you're writing down actionable

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,010
items you're further defining your scope

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,440
you're you're saying this is what I'm

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,450
gonna talk about and it's not

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,669
introduction it's I'm gonna explain why

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,130
we need to do this I'm gonna explain how

00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:36,470
our internal policies might hinder us

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,600
from a best practice in this case or

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:44,270
might promote a best practice that we

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,799
have to use it really solidifies how far

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,790
you're going to go and how focused

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:54,130
you're gonna get so that takes us to

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:57,860
step 3 creating action-oriented content

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,929
so just to kind of go back to the

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,040
objective here because we kind of have

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,940
gone

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:07,160
on a pass but I really want to focus on

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,900
creating content that's relative to your

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,700
team or organization's day-to-day

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,340
workflows and that you can there are

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,040
certain things that you can do that

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,050
really encourage that kind of content

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:25,850
and that really are suited for that

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:28,790
content to be effective so I'm gonna

00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,340
talk a little bit about action-oriented

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,440
and the alternative which is feature

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,480
based but before I do that I kind of

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,520
want to address something that I get

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,440
that I hear a lot of and I hear a lot of

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,430
people saying that they want hands-on

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,960
practice I think that that is a little

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:50,120
misguided I'll never forget the hands-on

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,250
practice that I had as a system

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,920
administrator while I was working on a

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,490
database and there was a replication

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,440
error on the slave and so I asked one of

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,480
the administrators on the floor hey I

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,430
don't know how to fix this can you help

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,660
me yeah just go ahead and run reset

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,590
slave like okay that was hands-on

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,660
practice if you're not much if you're

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,450
not familiar with what that can do that

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,830
was a lot of data loss that day

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:20,900
essentially we just blew away

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,360
Thursday's transactions for a company

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,210
because we essentially just reset

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,180
everything that was hands-on it was

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:32,630
training but it wasn't exactly valuable

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,560
I think what people actually benefit

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:39,410
from is action-oriented

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:44,480
relevant examples rather than actually

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,950
being on a hands-on environment so I

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,920
just kind of want to differentiate that

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,740
really quickly so what do we mean when

00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,900
we say action-oriented specifically and

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,680
and what do we mean when we say feature

00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:03,440
based so there are kind of two general

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:05,210
rules of creating content and this is an

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,000
example of if you're trying to learn how

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,160
to make an onion omelet I don't know why

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,900
one would make an onion omelet but if

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,330
you are trying to learn how to do that

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,020
you could go with a feature based which

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,880
is this first

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,620
example you could learn everything you

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,110
need to learn about onions you can learn

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,520
how to peel an onion cut an onion fry an

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,050
onion those are all things you need to

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:30,410
know but you could also go with a more

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:33,380
action-oriented method which is setting

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,360
up your workplace how can you know how

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,250
to peel or cut onions if you don't

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,170
really know how to set up your workspace

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,390
if you don't know what knife to use if

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,150
you don't know what's going to cut how

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,030
to cut how do you prepare your

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,560
ingredients how do you select spices

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,400
those are all kinds of things that

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:55,190
you're gonna do in your actual process

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,890
of making the onion omelet versus the

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:02,030
features of the the of the parts that go

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:05,120
in and onion omelet so I kind of compare

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,950
this to learning how to drive when you

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,840
learn how to drive a car someone doesn't

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,420
hand you the manual and say hey here are

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,490
all of the capabilities of a car learn

00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,770
this first and then we'll get behind the

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,810
wheel there's driver's ed but it's very

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,210
practical it's when you get on the road

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,340
you have to stop at stop signs when you

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,810
get into a traffic accident there are

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,970
certain procedures that you have to take

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,380
you don't just read the manual you

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,900
actually get that hands-on experience

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,400
and the learning is geared towards you

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,880
actually getting behind the wheel of a

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,880
car first

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,970
so here I just want to give an example

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,830
of what this kind of looks like before

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,290
we're talking about an example about

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,970
using the netcat command so in this

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:54,140
example I have what that command would

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:57,040
look like if I ran it and what the

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,210
actual output would be from that command

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,790
alternatively if we were talking about a

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,980
feature based example we would talk

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,570
about using the man page we could

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,250
explain the man page we could give

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,040
someone a man page and say we'll look it

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,600
up it tells you exactly what to do

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,790
technically it does tell you exactly

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,920
what to do but I would like to argue

00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:20,210
that reading a man page as a skill unto

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:22,130
itself it's a very complex thing and

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,380
especially when you're just starting out

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,750
and just trying to learn you don't know

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,970
how these things relate to your actual

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,770
job you just know it's capable of

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,170
that's it's much more advanced training

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,630
so when we're talking about gearing

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,630
towards something new we're really

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,480
talking about a specific context kind of

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,760
going back to my original example

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,920
someone taught me just one functionality

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,800
how to run it in my day to day job and

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,430
it was a very specific thing but it

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,110
wasn't and it wasn't overly complex but

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,090
it completely changed the way that I

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,400
work because it had context around it

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,350
because I was on the job and I was

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,700
saying I think this is the right answer

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,650
but I don't want to change it because I

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:09,170
don't know it completely changes the way

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:14,360
you look at things when you have context

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:17,180
around something and so a feature based

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:22,580
training item is really difficult to

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,750
provide that context around so the other

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,390
benefits that you get was

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,210
action-oriented items are you get that

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,220
first exposure so when you run there's a

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,600
certain confidence right to taking the

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,280
training that you get and actually

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,290
applying it to your day-to-day job

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,610
there's that blocker if you if you

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,200
really just needed to go and look

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,240
something up you could go and look

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,650
something up and google it and go and

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,980
apply it but there's that confidence

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:50,180
factor that you don't get by yourself

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,270
when you're giving training though you

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,310
have you have the ability to give

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,960
someone that first exposure you have the

00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,970
ability to show someone hey when you run

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,680
this command this is what it looks like

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,750
this is what you should expect to see

00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,530
when you run this command you can also

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,360
tailor your examples so you can tailor

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:13,130
exactly what you're looking for like how

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:18,110
would you use the netcat command in our

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:19,610
example here we talked about what you

00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:23,030
actually see when you run the command

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,430
you see a warning the actual output of

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,740
that would be warning and verse name

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,540
lookup failed well that kind of sounds

00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,340
like oh did I do something wrong did

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,900
this command fail did it actually do

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,720
what I needed it to do when you're

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,520
completely new warning and fails that

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,960
those are really intimidating there's a

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,080
certain confidence - well I don't really

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,730
know if I did it or not

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,940
the other thing is that we've got the

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,980
command specifically towards a domain so

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,840
before we just defined we wanted to we

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,120
wanted to check a remote server but in

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,160
actual practice what we mean by server

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,000
is probably a domain a lot of times you

00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:04,580
want to see hey is example.com expecting

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,240
accepting connections on 80 and we can

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:12,110
see the output here at the bottom versus

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,300
a man page you don't get that context

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,050
you don't get the Oh the warning is okay

00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,090
okay I didn't mess anything up I didn't

00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:23,420
cause an error or anything and it did do

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,560
what it I expected it to do and then you

00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,060
can address that in your training as

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,710
well you can say if you don't want to

00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,470
get this error there's a flag you can

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:32,450
run that doesn't do a reverse DNS lookup

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,950
so you don't get that error you can kind

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,080
of address like what people are going to

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:41,330
run into before they run into it by

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:44,330
themselves choose wisely

00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:46,340
you must choose but choose wisely this

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,040
article that I've linked here is really

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:52,190
really great I'm kind of explaining user

00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,950
stories for documentation a good example

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,290
of that would be like a man page or like

00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,270
the Apache documentation versus like a

00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,070
digitalocean article everybody loves

00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,260
additional ocean articles I love digital

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,030
ocean articles the action-oriented

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,390
they give you context around what you're

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:10,070
running this article does a really good

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,890
job of explaining how to make

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,860
documentation specifically but but

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,540
basically he kind of highlights there's

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,890
a time and a place for both there's a

00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,020
kind there's a time in a place for both

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,210
kinds of training when you're getting

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,650
into the more advanced trainings like

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,650
when you're teaching someone like hey

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,270
you already know exactly how netcat

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,490
works you know all of the fundamental

00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,510
concepts you need to understand in order

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,700
to troubleshoot a networking

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,950
infrastructure you really just need to

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,720
know this really specific nuanced

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,270
information then we might look at a

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,360
feature based documentation we might

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,610
look at a feature based training session

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,830
either way just know that when you

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,830
present your material you are choosing

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,750
one or the other or a variation and just

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,160
be aware of what you're choosing just

00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,020
make sure that you're making a choice

00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,670
you're not just

00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,170
throwing something out there and not

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,940
really thinking about the kind of thing

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,390
that you're that you're providing for

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:10,660
people so that takes us to our last step

00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:13,120
providing resources so the big one here

00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,190
is don't reinvent the wheel member when

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,900
I hop turned into a hub and it was

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,670
horrible it's because they tried to

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,080
reinvent the wheel they didn't need to

00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,059
change their whole name to sell burgers

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,480
kind of like you don't need to

00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:27,510
completely create a whole mountain of

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,010
resources to back up your training

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,020
curate versus create every single

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,429
resource that I have in here is from the

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,860
internet every single resource that I

00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:38,290
have to give you it's from somewhere

00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,210
else I'm not the first one to say these

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:42,040
things I'm just a I'm just someone

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,470
providing some context around them for

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,110
you so if you're teaching someone how to

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,940
use a command or how to use a certain

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,890
software there's already training on

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,720
that and once they get that initial

00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,900
contacts and that initial exposure

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,650
they're gonna be a lot more empowered to

00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,720
go and look at that material so curate

00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:04,720
your resources go and find where that

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,170
Red Hat access documentation is and link

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,970
that in there for them to look at later

00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:13,240
the other thing is if you are going to

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,290
create something create think about

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,990
whether you're creating reference

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:20,200
material or standalone material if

00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,640
you're giving an in-person training you

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,220
don't really need to create material

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,530
that should stand alone you're giving

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,960
that training and your context and your

00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,520
resource and so when you give material

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,220
for someone to continue their learning

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,400
it's more of a reference rather than

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,929
teaching them all over again

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,160
they already should have learned some

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,200
concepts they already should have

00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,540
learned some basic fundamental things

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,190
from your training session and what they

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,900
really need is just a reference like oh

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,120
what was that one command and that one

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,309
flag what was that one thing that she

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,050
said that's something that is a

00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:55,990
reference and not necessarily a

00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,210
standalone so don't create a whole novel

00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,710
just create a few little bullet points

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,220
if you really want to create something

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,290
yourself

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,260
and then lastly don't forget that you

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,460
are a resource if you are standing in

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,590
front of a crowd talking to people

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,879
you're there for questions you're there

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,590
for that instant

00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:13,720
the training that you give should be

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,279
tailored towards the kind of audience

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,460
that you have and if you're giving

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,769
training it's it's in person you are the

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,230
resource you you are the first resource

00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:25,269
so don't feel like you have to have

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,639
something in order to get up in front of

00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:30,159
someone especially for that initial

00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:34,110
exposure when we talk about training

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:37,629
today we really talk about training that

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,940
kind of provides a door it's you're

00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:42,340
never going to learn exactly how to do

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,480
something in a 45-minute session no

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,029
one's gonna be able to teach you exactly

00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,279
how to do something and all of the

00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,809
intricacies and nuances that come with

00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,730
whatever you're learning but what they

00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,950
can do is they can open a door for you

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,179
so that you can get that initial context

00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,129
so that you can get that initial

00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:00,190
understanding and carry it forward and

00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:02,730
continue to learn back to my example I

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:07,359
didn't learn all of the ins and outs of

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:09,330
permission structures or get FAC alekhya

00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,889
mask stuff for a long time after that

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,480
but what I did learn was this one simple

00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:15,460
saying that kind of gave me the

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,190
confidence to move on and do different

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,869
things that opened the door for me to

00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,129
learn more and that's really what you

00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:26,080
want to achieve when you're giving it an

00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:32,279
in-person training okay review I'm just

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:35,759
gonna take a dream water first okay so

00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:39,210
we talked about establishing scope in

00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:42,340
our subject definition with user stories

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:45,489
so specifically we talked about how to

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,779
do that with a user story template we

00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:49,659
talked about creating an actionable

00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:54,009
outline we talked about creating more

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:56,139
than just intro step1 step2 talked about

00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,820
creating an outline with actual items

00:32:56,139 --> 00:33:00,239
that you can go through and make an

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,129
action off of we talked about

00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:05,169
action-oriented content we talked about

00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:07,299
the kind of examples that go with

00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:09,659
action-oriented content that that kind

00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:13,350
of stuff is really how you tailor your

00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:15,399
experience to your workplace if you are

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:18,100
creating content that has a specific

00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,200
example with specifically how you would

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,080
run it in your environment it's a very

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,510
tailored example and it's very action or

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,779
it's for that person to go out and run

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:32,110
it or a variation of it when people see

00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,519
that first context not only do they get

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,279
the first exposure like we talked about

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,640
but they see how that learning is going

00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,549
to be used so when you give someone an

00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,460
example of how you are currently using

00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:47,980
it they know how to take that and apply

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,570
it to their own surroundings because

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:53,350
that's the way that they are going to

00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,850
use it when you do a feature based kind

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,289
of thing it kind of leaves it open for

00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,210
will okay I don't know how I would use

00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:01,179
that but when you're specific in your

00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:04,480
examples it's like okay well I don't

00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:06,039
need to netcat for domain or example.com

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,470
but I need to check an IP address

00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:10,839
I can probably still do that I just need

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,580
to find the flag when you are more

00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,349
specific it's actually a lot more

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:18,369
relevant even if it seems like it's a

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:21,129
little backwards versus generalized and

00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:23,020
then finally providing resources curri

00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:24,849
curri curri whatever you're saying

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,500
someone has probably already said it and

00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:28,690
spent a lot of time saying it and it's

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,629
probably said pretty well let that

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:37,570
person sub supplement what you're

00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:40,179
teaching someone and with that we are

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,869
through so we've got a few minutes for

00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,869
questions yes please

00:34:53,669 --> 00:35:04,079
yeah

00:34:54,849 --> 00:35:06,130
so yeah go ahead yeah so the question is

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,599
when you're giving training is

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,150
confidence really the main thing that

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,710
you're trying to achieve um of course

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,930
that really depends on what you're

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,210
trying to do but if you're specifically

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:19,240
teaching someone how to do something at

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,609
work how to do an actionable item then

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,710
oftentimes it's mostly a confidence

00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:25,720
thing the people that you're working

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,210
with your co-workers are probably free

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,859
intelligent people you know they could

00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,599
probably Google something like I said

00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:33,220
before but what they don't have is that

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,349
confidence for they don't have as unit

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,750
right next to them saying this is okay

00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:39,970
right and so what you're trying to

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,740
establish with those tailored examples

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,920
and with those action-oriented things is

00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,900
that is that build up of confidence so I

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,420
would say that that's a huge thing and

00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,069
the other thing is just making it one of

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,990
the ways to do that and one of the other

00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:55,089
things that you really should focus on

00:35:52,990 --> 00:36:01,650
is just really tailored specific

00:35:55,089 --> 00:36:01,650
examples so good

00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:18,910
so typically brown bags run about 45 30

00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:21,840
30 45 minutes and your example should be

00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,460
prius extinct so when you're when you're

00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,620
working with action-oriented examples

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,540
they kind of speak for themselves you

00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,790
kind of just have to say like look see

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:35,380
this is how you would do this and they

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:36,880
kind of speak for in you don't have to

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,920
explain as much as if you're actually

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,920
trying to explain that to someone then

00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,510
if you're trying to show someone so 30

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,730
to 45 minutes is really what you're

00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,550
aiming for when you're talking about

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,630
something really specific and focused

00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,580
there's there's other kinds of trainings

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,490
as week-long trainings and that's a

00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,870
different talk but today I really wanted

00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,960
to focus on this because I think it's

00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:01,180
really doable I think you can find 30 to

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,870
45 minutes in your work day hopefully at

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,790
some point to kind of help out your

00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,520
co-workers or to get help the other

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,480
thing that I didn't mention is um

00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,120
creating training is a really good way

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,740
to learn something one of the one of the

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,660
best things to learn something is to

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,250
teach something and all of the kind of

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,750
research and things that go into those

00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:24,610
are are really garnered in teaching

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,530
someone else you kind of don't feel like

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,150
you're a senior developer until you're

00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,730
helping other people right because then

00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:33,580
you're really explaining and okay this

00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,040
is actually how this works one of the

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,750
things with the way we do it is when you

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,030
provide a template for people it's a lot

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,400
easier for someone who may not know

00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,170
exactly a whole lot about the subject to

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,350
actually get started so hey here's a

00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,820
template as a something I want to so

00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,110
that um it makes it a lot more

00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:57,060
approachable for someone to learn

00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:57,060
something anything else

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,640
yes

00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:16,310
so can I just ask like what you guys are

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,770
doing here like are you trainers are you

00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:21,220
seniors are you beginners are you just

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,220
curious

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:36,040
yeah mm-hmm

00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,440
yeah definitely cool

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:53,730
that's awesome okay so kind of looking

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,730
for a ways to give training them

00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,460
right yeah yeah the more I and I have I

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,560
can't emphasize this enough the more

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,610
specific you are the more relevant is

00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,000
going to be it's it's not just you don't

00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,770
have to speak to a broad generalization

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,300
there are a lot of similarities and

00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:31,220
patterns you find with very specific

00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:33,490
material anyone else I'm telling were

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,490
they here

00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,460
right yeah so that's kind of one of the

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,440
battles that we have - we have a really

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,869
specific infrastructure that has

00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,240
limitations and so a lot of our training

00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:21,609
is how do you get around this limitation

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,849
why does it make sense to run this this

00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:23,849
way

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,030
yeah so I'm really like reveal yes

00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:51,190
that's what I'm using for mine it's

00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:54,010
pretty flexible reveal yes yeah you have

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,100
to know a little bit about CSS that's

00:40:54,010 --> 00:41:00,070
actually how I'm learning CSS is using

00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,720
this but it's more interactive like you

00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,370
said there's a lot more capabilities

00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,410
than just doing a PowerPoint with the

00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,410
seam yeah

00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:30,930
a website for one little thing to try

00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:32,190
mm-hmm I have not gone that far that is

00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,960
something that I'm working on right now

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:38,430
so I'm actually one of the things I'm

00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,540
working on is I'm releasing kind of so

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm going to start taking feedback

00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,610
what's the user template so like hey if

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,500
you want to request training use the

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:50,370
template to request it so I know what

00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,070
level you are it's a lot more accurate

00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,870
data and then it's also more tailored

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,010
towards I get a lot of requests and I'll

00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,360
be like well why do you want that and

00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,040
they're like well I want to be able to

00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,410
do this other thing I'm like okay but

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,270
that's not how you do that and so that

00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,040
kind of will help with that but one of

00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,920
the other things is we have so many

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,600
resources within our infrastructure I

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,400
work for Rackspace we're a hosting

00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,020
company and so we deal with so many

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,870
different things we have so many

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,640
talented people and we really want to

00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,680
tap those resources but to make that

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,450
happen you kind of have to make it easy

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,970
and so one of the other things I'm

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:26,880
working on is a template for creating a

00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,390
training document as well as like a

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,390
brown bag

00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:46,609
Texas yeah our headquarters is in Texas

00:42:43,220 --> 00:43:00,710
for the US Blacksburg is one of our data

00:42:46,609 --> 00:43:02,270
centers oh okay nice cool any other

00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,109
questions anyone else want to tell me

00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,550
why they're here

00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:09,170
I know volunteering is just so great I'm

00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,650
gonna make eye contact with every single

00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,680
one of you till you tell me why you're

00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,680
here

00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:23,770
just this talk I just want to know why

00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:27,170
why are you here like what what is here

00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:30,280
yeah that's true

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:33,280
there's nothing else to go to you really

00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,280
huh

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,270
so I've been a trainer for a few years

00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:50,730
now and I created our onboarding process

00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:54,210
and I created I'm creating our leveling

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:57,809
process and a lot of the things that

00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:06,809
come with that is making other trainings

00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:08,329
to go along like that so the change from

00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,390
assistant Menem strated to a trainer

00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:14,400
know so I was kind of already I the role

00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,809
didn't exist before Mia but I was kind

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,210
of doing that stuff like I was

00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:19,770
interested in learning more and so I was

00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:24,270
like setting up study groups and I was

00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:26,819
like setting up like certain guides and

00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:28,559
stuff for people to follow and our

00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:31,290
director just approaching it was like

00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:34,079
hey would you like to do this like we

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:37,260
need this and I think you'd be good at

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,240
it and so that's kind of yeah it's a

00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,109
classic case of I was doing it before I

00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:45,150
actually started officially doing it

00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:47,339
yeah and that's kind of why I encourage

00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:49,829
brown bags in general is because I got

00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:51,030
started just telling my team how to do

00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:54,359
this stupid thing that I learned how to

00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,890
do or telling having someone else teach

00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,200
me like well how do you get around that

00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,030
like weird error all the time because

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,609
our infrastructure is like hot down half

00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,589
the time like what what do I do

00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:08,160
and so like those little things are kind

00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:09,750
of what I really started to want to

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,640
learn to kind of get to the next level

00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,650
because a lot of times like senior

00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,660
administrators aren't just like I mean

00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,790
they're really smart but they also they

00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,559
they're really smart at working in their

00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,720
environment and so it's like hey

00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,299
so-and-so knows who to talk to to get

00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,480
that thing so-and-so knows how to push

00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:29,760
that through because he knows like how

00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,290
our back-end works so like learning all

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,869
those little intricacies really add up

00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,579
to being like a consistent well-rounded

00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:40,290
engineer and so that's kind of what I

00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:46,120
was looking to do and just kind of came

00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:48,650
from there cool

00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,130
all right well my computer is telling me

00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,260
I'm done

00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:57,199
so uh-huh thank you

00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:57,199
