yep and so Chuck said beheading us when

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:25,140
either one works but they told that I

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:32,099
can see with whatever you give me as

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:34,380
long as as long as my angle double check

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,320
can just talk anything protect what he

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,120
is most useless phrasing is pretty much

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,520
and I'm talking and talking I'm saying

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,460
words words how those can give me the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,309
back and you're in the back anybody yes

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,890
yes good all right here to be in the

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,610
hallway baby no actually we can get it

00:00:49,890 --> 00:01:01,500
that way what what did you need the USBC

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:04,460
to whatever the victors yep talk to

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,460
Eddie had something so

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,890
[Music]

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,760
that

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,760
yeah

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,600
and

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,250
the

00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,909
Oh

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,909
working correctly

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,630
so just on the off-chance is it they're

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,210
not able to find intelligence anybody in

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:13,599
the crowd the USB seeds to HDMI adapter

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:15,640
that I can borrow for about yes boys

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,440
depends making backup plans the wine

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,030
rotten mother didn't act up so I should

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,190
all break three in all three built is

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,910
that's one at the tomb is last year my

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,910
dad built it

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,129
[Music]

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,650
I'm here that's why the testicle

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,420
me

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,019
we

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,510
there's

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:11,040
okay the earth we got emissions are you

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,930
got one we got one about yep

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,750
let's go ahead and get reporting who's

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:20,580
on stage it's automatic

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,860
okay well then let's go ahead and get

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,680
started

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,660
112 over 220 19m southeast here in

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,100
Charlotte did your first time welcome

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:35,310
and go on now my name is Robert Marshall

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,680
and I am a distribution here at give up

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,080
I started off 20 years ago

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,540
so a little over I took my way into the

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,020
Intimidator architect go all the way

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,450
down to the bottom the foolish - Monroe

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,539
- for a while and now I do distribution

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,520
what this is a nutshell is taking all

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,030
the work by the folks is right to get

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,320
blockages everything that makes it nuts

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,780
package it up and easy for you to

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,780
install on the bus that's a positive

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,840
charge and that's kind of why we're here

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,120
now just a quick feel how many folks

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:15,810
here have used to readies for longer

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,389
than six months okay so I see three

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,289
total let's go ahead and let's get

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:26,280
rolling start now life all in good talks

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:30,330
it started with a simple fix right all

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,290
we're trying to do is at me remote

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,410
repositories to get live on the cloud

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,910
we're trying to put in future parity if

00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,220
you want to know more about that journey

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,810
there's a great talk that was given by

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,980
Jason Flom who's one of the other

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,040
engineers of my team

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,110
it's called from modeling to

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,580
micro-services pitchforks novelty that

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,490
was given here at the southeast leaves

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:56,420
Fest last year he also gave it that cute

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,130
con I believe so just go onto YouTube

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,710
and take a look you can find it again

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,340
his name is Jason is longer but we can

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,820
go on and talk about the initial issue

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,950
so this is what we go and said hey I try

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,020
to do this and I just I see the desert a

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:16,220
it says key scan they're not in the

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:20,080
containers right so we just had those we

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:24,170
go sure not a problem or add those

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,610
except it didn't okay now this is one of

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,540
the other team members I've worked with

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,660
and he said why did this just it just it

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,290
didn't work right now remember we're in

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,720
the cloud so we're your way back 2009

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:44,270
what is the cloud right there's a lovely

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,360
quote from Marc Benioff very but we

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,230
don't want aspirations we work where the

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,990
rubber meets the road

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:54,610
and since kubernetes is shaping up to be

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,730
the operating system of the cloud well

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:01,550
now we have our family right this is we

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,840
talk this nap now keep control and if

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,289
people want to hug you want to pronounce

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,180
that will have a purse

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,149
we talk about it this comes up every

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,460
time I've ever seen talked about but I

00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,710
call keep control and that's how we talk

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,379
to our our cluster and that's why this

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,419
talk is when everything is a clustered

00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:23,369
isn't working you readies right no jokes

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:24,599
no and how is our package manager now I

00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,490
know there are other things out there

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,289
this is what a lot of folks use this is

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,110
what we use to get lab so that's our

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,719
package manager and then if you work

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,779
with your manager just getting into it

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,599
these two tools freezes cube CTX and qns

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,599
and what these do for you if you work

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,459
with a lot of clusters which I have an

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,130
average seven or eight at a given time

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,709
or in multiple namespaces which I have

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,899
multiple set up at these time this lets

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,940
you get through and work faster because

00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,529
it says I'm working with business to the

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,300
cluster with the short command

00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm to be in this named stage right now

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,170
and if you've done it to the cube

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,160
control command which is basically it

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,930
you don't they context this long long

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,420
long string no you don't want to type it

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:15,060
it's much better say cube CTX self 20:19

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:19,380
much much easier switching right so

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:22,050
here's our five individuals and what's

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,699
going on inside of a cluster now sensors

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,100
a lot of dogs in here who are new to

00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:28,410
kubernetes it looks like this is what a

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,540
cluster actually looks like and this is

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,550
hanging directly to proven in ohio

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,730
website and their overview of the

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,300
operation can readies with cesium which

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,069
is a control module now here's the thing

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,990
this basically how many people have been

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:46,319
doing since initiation works for longer

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,480
than that how many have piles of

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,459
shelters been driving around job job

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,540
expenses

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,279
for you to potatoes replaces all of that

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,529
so this like architecture is a drawing

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,389
will be try the view our own but this is

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,240
thousands of us trying to do it wants to

00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,740
be done because we're all sick of

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,550
carting around our scripts and hoping to

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,579
continue to be portable right so if this

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,309
is our operating system right and we're

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:15,559
going to hear well we need to set it up

00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,999
to work it's our application we're going

00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,429
to say okay go into the mirroring

00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:21,199
section our repository set up we gotta

00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:24,290
write a public and private key problem

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,119
see Mary so let's head scene can't

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,579
reproduce the problem and this is in the

00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:30,740
UI right whenever you want trying to

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:34,279
accompany go to the application demand

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,860
you say can i reproduce the entry and

00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,350
here it is and there's the error message

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:44,240
we try here this was being reported

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,619
after we added ssh into the container in

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,899
a bathtub per second ask one more

00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:51,470
question I know there's only three folks

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:54,350
at raise their hands for more than six

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,119
months is that one is everyone on board

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,089
with this idea that if we go back to

00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:02,119
this what's going on here is we're

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,149
taking containers define you know define

00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,920
containers and we're writing them

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,509
basically on command is basically the

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,519
cloud was the containers are running

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,679
inside that are we are all comfortable

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,699
to does anybody have a question or have

00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,959
a I just wanted to make sure because

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,309
that's kind of important as we go along

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:25,279
if we're dealing with containers now

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:28,899
that's our that is our our problem so

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,730
let's go to the family get lost right

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:34,350
we're looking at the ghibli pod and a

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,690
pod is basically it's a single uniform

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,430
as containers minutes and this is what

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,960
we're looking at I know that it's in

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,450
Italy because Italy is something we've

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,200
written to make a service out of talking

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:50,430
to the get file system you know and we

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:54,000
look at that we get this back the output

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:57,500
in the log okay awesome

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,340
there's a lot up there but there's a

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,330
something a little familiar

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:10,410
I almost got a job looking at that look

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:12,180
at this again it's so as great I don't

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,620
nothing more I've used my fan line tools

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:18,060
with the power operating system right

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:21,450
there's the cloud we don't nothing that

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,930
is useless uselessly consistent right I

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,750
mean it's there it's useful but it's not

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,090
useful to us the troubleshoot this and

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,060
but you're saying how many people have a

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:37,250
complex have application in support

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:40,620
folks do you long 100 everything it does

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,600
know right this is this thing is you see

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,790
something consistent is not enough on

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,380
the application it's just if we logged

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,150
everything we lose all performance

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,150
so right there are some things you can't

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,980
you just you know you don't do so what

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,350
do we do you don't see it in the logs

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,340
from the pods which is the output on the

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,650
containers they're from

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,720
right we're kind of the lost state so

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:06,320
the application is now the dreaded black

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,570
box we have no idea is the laws are

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,780
telling us and the behavior on the UI

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,210
was telling us the same thing so what

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,740
are we going to do well as an admin

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,680
we're used to saying what about the

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,980
powers of observation what can we see

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,190
what can we observe but if in the cloud

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,100
right

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,440
we know how are you doing well just

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,030
remember this file is this is my

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,520
favorite sticker I have this at home

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,610
the cloud is just nobody else's computer

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,470
right so we really don't need append

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,330
this is what I talk to folks about their

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,340
ideas and what they're doing this is

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,080
what most of us it's time like the brain

00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,340
shuts down if the cloud is different

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,280
know somebody else's computer right and

00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,790
this is 2015's this is about you ever

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,620
take six years after that moment earlier

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,040
right through six years for some of this

00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:02,240
and kind of make it possible so this is

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,870
my first time I saw so there's some

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,520
caveats here right container activation

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,740
on a Linux distribution now what does

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,680
that mean that means is based on Alpine

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,360
that in slim you pick what you want I

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,640
can give you containers or two things

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,480
for the very container where you can put

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,050
like say just go away or just a

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,310
operating file in there and there's no

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,780
distribution or poor subsystem under

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,640
there at all it's just a container

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,950
you're operating so it's nothing else

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,110
that is outside of what we're talking

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,430
about they exist but not very many

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,610
people are doing that that I've seen

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:41,240
okay and also are your favorite tools

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,970
install so I mean give me a wild best

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,550
race in they're kind of heavy but hol

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,590
soft should be in there I Oh Tom write

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,620
all over say

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,120
to diagnose and stuff in Linux are all

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,430
inside of your container provided we've

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,500
installed one of these you know and legs

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,410
to show that has it and then of course

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,050
you know can ask you how that extra load

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,400
right for those of you who are

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,110
recommended you know they could have

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,330
plenty of extra resources that your

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,190
cloud is not constrained at all and that

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:11,140
it costs nothing to scare everything up

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,650
doesn't ask you your bills monthly at

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,839
all right so you know can your container

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,550
take that extra work and I'm going to

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,740
talk about some assumptions ideas and

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,290
crafting this talk I'm going to assume

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,450
that you have some knowledge of linux so

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,279
knowledge containers and then you have

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,589
some experience trouble sheets now if

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,830
none of these apply to you that's okay

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:35,110
just raise your hand ask a question it's

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,730
how we all learn right there's no such

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,370
thing as it helps question the only dumb

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,120
questions they want you to down right so

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:47,200
ask away

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,150
i think so with this said would it be

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,540
great if just watch the black box and

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:57,460
we're not patient all right well I'll be

00:15:52,540 --> 00:16:01,780
nozzles we can how many clothes your new

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:04,450
love watch bility Linux good number

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,400
problem so this is actually something I

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,740
was never used before believe it or not

00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,290
yeah good friend of mine said well how

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,810
did you see the watch he's what he's

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,490
watch yeah this lets us watch what's

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,320
going on this isn't competed on a trick

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,440
man

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,230
longer so let's try it so we're gonna

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,700
first use our cloud operating systems

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,440
like man line up the clown that gives

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,530
our container so we can get towards

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,900
Lenox and we're going to effect into the

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,400
leaf pop again you want to know more

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,800
about Gillian how it runs and let me

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,020
know to go here right my cursor or

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,700
violets my research

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,370
pitchforks not included by jason blum

00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,260
we'll go into more detail on that it's

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,180
just it's a lot of stuff is talking

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:50,700
really good it's an hour long just that

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:53,910
that's why I'm referring to that so we

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,640
do that and then we watch that this is

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,850
watching we're looking for the processes

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,010
and we are looking for what's going on

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,130
and we're going to search that for

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:11,429
anything stewing in sensation we find

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:13,439
this so this how the news are watch till

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,770
he tells us that the application is

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,720
trying to run this man okay

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,339
right everybody most people here play

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,850
with this things everybody cool is going

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,949
on here

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,760
I should mention something else here

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:28,890
that's going on there strict stream post

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,390
he checking is turned on the environment

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,760
of also it's not being masked as an

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,760
option here but that is play what's

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:40,350
going on here now let's pay attention to

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,600
one news information here this is the

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,670
identity bodies that's the file were

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,770
like on generate your SSH public private

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,110
public keys this is going to be your

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,210
private ena now in this building

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,610
distorted we created some creative feet

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,140
there earlier where that works is you

00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,120
create the team's hair and it gives the

00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,429
public team and you put that public team

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,470
the remote repository you're going into

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:06,480
your vacuum so this is how is it grabbed

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,030
on you said it when you I this is how

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,120
it's a rabbit from this model generated

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:15,270
on the fly so let's see what happens

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,340
we're trying to go here so we're gonna

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,780
do that with it with watch we're going

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,690
to watch that temperature rectory within

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:25,419
LS and we want to figure out what

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:30,169
happened what is going on

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:31,970
there's director and this get lab shows

00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,309
he thought oh Allah Allah that is our

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,970
thing right right and see right there

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,760
it's there

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:43,250
what's your program looks right okay so

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,710
this looks fine so what's going on right

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,540
we Steve is making the demand I know

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,760
what the environments doing like you see

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,090
the Palmer item up there so why doesn't

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:59,030
it work well like most problem solving

00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:03,830
in Linux right so what does entangle

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:08,660
tell us it says well right I'll let you

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:15,140
read it for yourselves but part we want

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:17,540
to pay attention to highlighted it will

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:22,370
add addresses to the destination host

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:25,100
Gardeners are not found regardless of

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,049
misterpost he's dead surf or ski says

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,380
only add

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,660
hosts right only add the hood as opposed

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,340
if you're checking the keenest it well

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,679
this has a matter of seven per se you

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,380
can add the most this was still at it no

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,559
matter what and it's different than

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:46,280
middle attack so we don't want to mess

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,940
with so we've kind of found the scope

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:53,030
he's up you know what's going on but

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,860
this is going to confound us right and

00:19:53,030 --> 00:20:01,280
do you see the problem it says because

00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:05,690
this it's read-only

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,640
so it's tried both zero four zero so

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,470
it's trying I that most kids go on a can

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,900
and when he can begin to signify Kent

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:16,730
Clinton so now we know what's going on

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,540
we've done it purely by observation in

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,660
the black box

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:24,710
right look this I go right

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:28,940
well now it's hard to write we don't

00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:31,670
file so that's why we've got to figure

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,910
it out that's all the tools we use the

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:37,010
question is what was our actual Club and

00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,310
the actual book was a little bit

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:42,740
different the actual bug is when that he

00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,600
got created when you're trying to

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,370
reconnect I just meant you keep it

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,960
didn't remember the private piece so

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,430
when I tried to write file is putting a

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,530
brand-new T and every time it wasn't

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,040
shake this out but we never would have

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,730
traded it down to that without using

00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:02,110
just the old school go to spam line

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:06,650
black box figure out where it's going so

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:11,090
what are takeaways what do we know

00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:13,010
well we know that don't panic right it's

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,610
the clouds but it's just somebody else's

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,460
computer

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,460
right right different places have the

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,030
same faces right it's all it's mostly

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,650
just a Linux under the hood right so if

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:28,910
you need if you need a clinics and Linux

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:32,000
and know that you're available tools now

00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,340
here's the thing you need for regret

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,330
leave access to the container one of the

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,840
other things I'm

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,850
not all schools are being all containers

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,909
is an important thing peace of mind that

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,169
some tools do provide type of threat

00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:48,950
vectors that you don't want in your

00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:51,950
container so consider having your basic

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,779
container and in your CI have a

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,610
container that has the tools come flow

00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,320
through and you can deploy to your

00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,779
station cluster you're testing cluster

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,789
and go i reproduce this now with all the

00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,249
tools I need but in production I'm not

00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:06,200
putting all that baggage out there right

00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:09,440
it's not that it's not just rent vectors

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,989
it's sighs I guess all the other stuff

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,059
going on but figure out what schools for

00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:17,179
having know what available schools can

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:19,730
use right so if you have you know 10 20

00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:22,509
years of let experience bring it on over

00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:25,159
it's more than welcome in the cloud so

00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,929
at this point I open up this question

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,899
because that's just kind of you know

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:32,960
this is that is where we're going with

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:34,850
this right how to troubleshoot what the

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,919
troubleshoot and so this is time for

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,779
questions if you run two things the join

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,190
three most have six months is everybody

00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:47,090
in this room and one of these touch

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:49,070
screens raise your hand okay

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,100
so for the folks that haven't touched

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:55,129
your ins I'm going to ask what would you

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,289
like to know right cuz you have

00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:59,779
absolutely this is this whole thing

00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,279
about troubleshooting so is that you

00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:04,899
know if you this there's anything you

00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,899
want extra now is the time

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,150
to start getting into it we know what to

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,300
us they're not the console that is

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,490
starting into it even know what to ask

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:28,140
does anybody have any questions on the

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:30,780
top on the content so the question is

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,050
how is the cooperate container different

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,180
from a process so a container to mention

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,490
is running on the link system so the

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,650
container is basically namespaces now

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,750
containers are st namespace and it's

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,460
running that through the docker run

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,830
through a container run twice that's

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,290
currently dr. you run through others but

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,540
it's way different processes is so

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,520
contained so because that's the

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,840
namespace if that is not able to talk to

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,150
other things that's not to say you

00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,150
cannot break out into the container okay

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,310
I said that about three weeks they'll be

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,280
a cute little web page with a cute name

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,020
in the picture say it's not completely

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,460
contained and there have been a few of

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,790
those already so you know it isn't thing

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,410
but it's basically isolation okay we're

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,500
a process where you just on the system

00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,150
is not isolated this ice other thing is

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,740
that this is scalable because the

00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:25,140
container from doing resource control so

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,970
if you say I let's get a good example on

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,150
let's say you're running a very large no

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,850
sighs okay and you need a lot of piggy

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,930
Connors we're gonna go with the basic

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,340
and you have a lot of things going to

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,040
serve to the front-end going to database

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,870
we all want or they basically all know

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,430
you lost the ability to read but you

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,350
also want a lot of the front-end to be

00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:48,450
able to respond and to load balanced

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:50,130
across your not bottleneck and so what I

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,810
can do for containers let you do is

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,760
instead of a single process or try to

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,180
know you can spread them across multiple

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,460
machines remember how kubernetes cluster

00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:02,510
is not just on one

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:06,980
gene you have a control a control node

00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:10,670
and then you also have replicas so you

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,520
may have 40 machines of which 15 of them

00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:15,800
are running your funding application and

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,870
that for an application is they believe

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:21,190
to be more balanced when it sells it

00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:23,720
gets the way we know I'm saying about

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,340
the handles Cooper he handles all of

00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,650
that for you behind the scene

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,800
so all that places you'd be used to for

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:33,260
trying to failover if one of those pods

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,700
goes away which has the container in it

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,320
unlike the process we have done

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,800
throughout the same consistency unit

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,390
watch or Jafar error so whatever you use

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,670
to say and I want to make sure when this

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,200
process does wake of that a container

00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,750
and kubernetes will do it for you

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,730
because it does because Cooper is

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,760
designed makes you manage that quart you

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,740
babysit your application and make sure

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,870
there's what you define is application

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,940
to find my state I want 15 of these

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,710
running one of these two of these one of

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,500
those and one of these that this thing

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,180
happens great it just maintains that for

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,310
you period in the story boxes

00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,320
that's the four differences it was doing

00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,910
all that for you where's the process you

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,310
probably have to do with yourself or

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:17,000
have some other extra tool that may not

00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:25,030
maintain that same separation service so

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,030
it is that awesome other questions right

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,500
so the question is are there any good

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,470
security tips or controls for Humanity

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:41,930
so the first one I would say is number

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:44,270
one be aware I'm just I'm going to chat

00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,520
all from a previous speaker that I've

00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,290
heard inch miss now when you get the

00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,790
commenter's behind this that running

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,460
container is downloading from the

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,690
internet where he is running so be

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,030
mindful of what you're putting in your

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,550
containers right look for things that

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,440
have addressed assign your control it

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,010
some random person with thousand dollars

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,160
of new ideas when they are on it right

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:09,260
if if there's an issue if you're using a

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,930
main complication doesn't come from

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,030
source somebody else's port you don't

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,100
know so make sure we're using containers

00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,470
that's generally Canada hygiene that's

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,680
not little communities but that is the

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,020
biggest wall that I see and also a

00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,090
definitely like make sure that like you

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,910
don't need these two containers need to

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:31,010
be together how do these we're going to

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,720
pause you separate them that can be a

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,040
security concerns if you start adding or

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
I'm gonna have them separate let's talk

00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,760
to each other how are they talking to

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,860
each other again this goes back to a lot

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,020
of the stuff they flower the sounds

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,520
different but it's not as if I have two

00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,470
different virtual machines we do

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,950
physical machines how about them talk to

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,680
each other

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,900
do you want to cryptid how they talk how

00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,020
much are the secrets cooperate now has a

00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:56,480
built-in secrets mechanism so you can

00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,940
you know just go through that kind of

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,530
like the community and the answers in

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,420
the home one two okay most of the

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,730
illustration tools in the platform tools

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,370
are really from this idea of separates

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,960
and bolts we store stuff away and keep

00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,450
them encrypted so that the thing that

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,360
don't put passwords and vilest don't put

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,080
passwords announced in kubernetes with

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,549
containers

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,789
right they pass this way it's gonna

00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:24,919
write scripts in to the container

00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:28,070
don't put your passwords in there just

00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,110
don't and I know I say that and knowing

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,090
full well deserved a few breaches where

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,470
the whole point was somebody put the

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:41,809
password in plain text I hope you

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:44,659
Republic came in and well TT so right so

00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:47,029
your basic the biggest thing in security

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:50,299
is never the software it's a hundred

00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,490
right you may be a Kevin ethnic crew

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:55,130
this gonna shadow it down with no

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:57,139
computer protection known internet why

00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,120
immigrants new wire transferred himself

00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:02,120
like a million bucks when a bank

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,100
executive my superiors loading up on the

00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,960
improvement and you know eight dollars

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,279
you guys that we have a guy in that's

00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,169
what you already gave me so security

00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,000
started advice right but those are the

00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:16,580
biggest tips keep your wits about you

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,919
treated viably what an inter system and

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,799
again I can't stress it enough container

00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,409
hygiene container hygiene you haven't

00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,330
heard me saying container hygiene know

00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:27,590
know where your containers come from I

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,080
know which is what I mean your

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,090
containers thank you talk of it is the

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,820
whole one containers is the you have a

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:37,399
single etiquette image is a source of

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:44,149
truth and if you do any kind of auditing

00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:46,220
for a Sox PCI DC VCS faster I forget it

00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,520
happen too soon either system if I am

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,190
NOT a specialist on that

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,650
and but if you do not have two clients

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,870
auditing containers are great because

00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,820
you can say we signed Emily sealed it we

00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,410
certify this is safe and it's

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,720
reproducible everywhere you are not

00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,330
deploying the machine running the script

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,179
running you know of tracing tool by

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,350
deficit see it's locked sealed

00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,360
cryptographically signed in container

00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,770
and you always know it's changed because

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,890
it checks doesn't change unless

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,480
something changed right and that's the

00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,760
biggest thing is to be aware of that I

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,470
know I am on that but I cannot tell you

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,480
how many of horror stories on the

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,970
various places like work we're talking

00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,620
down to you know what you are putting on

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:30,330
your server and the answer is no no I

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:33,059
didn't write so and that's you know just

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:38,179
par for the course other questions I saw

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,179
another hand right back

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,730
sure so the question is I mentioned

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,670
context and matrix earlier and can i

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,340
elaborate on that how to use them so in

00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:55,650
the world of kubernetes you are always

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,000
dealing with a cluster and in clusters

00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:59,790
the description of you know you have

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,500
troll node and some they call the minion

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,370
nodes things that do the work contain

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:10,920
the positives

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:14,070
yeah this is work so so each one of

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,880
those clusters two cute control is a

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:20,580
context so I have worked in the context

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,350
of my cluster now in my case everything

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,660
I do in get lab I've worked mostly

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,180
through GAE which is Google's

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,520
environment I've also dealt with eks

00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,110
which is amazon's cloud environment i've

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,850
also dealt with Vinnie queue just

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,120
locally we're again I'm starting to

00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:38,430
think a 3s just scaled down all of these

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,380
are contexts that cube control to talk

00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,540
to you each one of these individual

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,440
clusters in the case of chica he and

00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:48,360
Google I've got I've had up to five

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,830
because we have a weekly broadcast and

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,200
cognitive demo where we can all over

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,660
work for the week I'm demoing that that

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,790
up I have my testing cluster issues I'm

00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,980
working on from customers I have the

00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,660
cluster that's just can I break it what

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,840
things can I find that I like to see

00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,640
right this customer zero so that kind of

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,680
thing but I have to squish all that

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,260
switching context it's really to say I'm

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,940
switching between clusters so when I

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,910
think switching context just think

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:18,120
switching cluster and that'll carry you

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:20,460
through now namespaces now for the most

00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,410
part I don't use very many multiple

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,270
things businesses are golfing inside of

00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,250
my cluster you can have different

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,580
namespaces there's a system namespace

00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,679
always and then your generic like your

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,509
public namespace but let's say you want

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,610
to install the application to gender

00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:39,929
names basically tenant you can do that

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,690
here there I think there is some mess to

00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:45,350
that I have not gone deep into that

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:48,210
myself mostly when I'm learning spaces

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,710
here's an operator sitting over here the

00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,389
operator pattern is basically think of

00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,679
it like an operator that you're saying

00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:54,840
there hey hey I'm gonna make your

00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:58,049
cluster run on the turnip hog turned

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,700
down automatically we have that and the

00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:02,519
current cognitive charter forget luck

00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,289
right but you can move that into its own

00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,029
spaces back into the main space as well

00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:08,899
so these are all things you can do you

00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:12,830
can separate concerns so for example

00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,830
let's see if the internet works

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:23,539
oh I only have us PC ports so regular

00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:29,659
cables don't work Bobby

00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:29,659
see here pull this over

00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,640
not when that's really up

00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:45,080
am i all agree all right it's always

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,700
hard to do that from the side I never

00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,090
developed that superpower of being able

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:52,160
to think on the side of the screen so so

00:33:50,090 --> 00:34:00,410
we look at this and you can see where I

00:33:52,160 --> 00:34:02,300
was looking at different items let's put

00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,070
the microphone down I apologize the

00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,780
folks even remotely of this make sure

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,780
your microphone is powerful

00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:21,149
so these are all the clusters that I can

00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:23,730
link infinity that's what cubes EPS and

00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:27,289
these are all my contexts and then I

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,289
want to look at hue namespace

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,310
I totally spelled that wrong I did

00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,020
to public ball

00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,990
right if you public all consistent and

00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:51,849
you can add I could and I could install

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,460
mine get that application into a private

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,839
names base if i wanted i usually don't

00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,190
because it's not worth the effort

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,450
because i'm just installing that to my

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,400
cluster they're tearing it down about

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,920
two hours later I'm doing very little

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,089
work but namespaces allow you to segment

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,549
so let's just say you had

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:07,450
multiplications you can have give up

00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:10,359
here

00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,740
you're a wordpress blog there and you

00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,390
can have them all on the same cluster

00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,480
provided your cluster have a sump

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:18,940
resources create enough pods to do that

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,980
again resourcing is key to that but you

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,690
can't do it they do that too so you

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,520
don't have to have no can you imagine

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,500
that you have horrible occasions running

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,690
and you went show me the running pods

00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,690
and you got everything which you know

00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,860
oh boy

00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:56,009
and this is why I don't do live demos

00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:58,699
because here we go that's all the pods

00:35:56,009 --> 00:36:00,929
that's all the pods just for you left

00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:02,029
that's all I have run it you can see if

00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:05,759
I scrolled off the screen

00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:07,349
there's so that is why we have

00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:08,999
namespaces so if you have multiplication

00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:11,879
you can separate them out so when you're

00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:13,169
trying to diagnose it right and again

00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:30,119
this is very you're running a production

00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:32,879
cluster multiple is that in my SSH

00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:36,329
example what is it expecting to connect

00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:39,149
to so I'm gonna assume here that what

00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:41,999
you mean is what is the gate lab process

00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:44,159
trying to ssh to and the answer is it's

00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,569
the get user using ssh over get because

00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,049
it does do an ssh connection to

00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:51,389
establish to then connect verify the

00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:52,619
host key and pull the repository just

00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:55,019
like if you had a key on your local

00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,329
machine and you said pull from a

00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:59,099
repository where you have private access

00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:02,909
via ssh as opposed to pulling through

00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:05,999
HTTP so it's setting that up so the fact

00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:07,499
that it can't cuz really pulling get

00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:10,709
over ssh is kind of a nice little

00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:12,059
wrapper around SSH SSH protocol can't

00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,929
connect that way and that's what we're

00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:15,449
trying to connect to you were saying

00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:17,939
connect to that remote repository and we

00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:19,319
can't and that's bad when you're trying

00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:25,819
to mirror it right because you had to

00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,819
connect that cool other questions

00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:43,720
it is not syslog per se it is stored on

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,400
the container so it is ephemeral to the

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,840
container so when the container goes

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,930
away I think you look at some previous

00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,820
logs but not all the question was like

00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:55,120
when I look at the log for the container

00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,220
where does it come from now one of those

00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,240
things is you can configure those logs

00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:04,720
to go places so if you have I don't know

00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:08,410
an elk instance which is elk is elastic

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,570
search log stash and Qabbani or you have

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,790
Splunk or some other log ingestion tool

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,100
you can wire that up to send logs

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,290
wherever again it's just a cloud

00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,000
operating system it's the same thing

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,790
wire it up and send it to your

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,930
monitoring gitlab itself has some

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,270
built-in monitoring and we keep

00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,400
extending that so you can actually look

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:32,830
with nice dashboard and see what's going

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:34,180
on so that's that's basically where

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,410
those logs come from and go but you have

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,720
to be mindful of where they're going

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,900
right because again containers are

00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,550
ephemeral so if you want to save it just

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,230
be aware and and the documentation does

00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,830
cover like how to save state where to

00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,650
put things

00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,930
so as you're designing your your cluster

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,670
and as you're putting together the again

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,640
if you're packaging with helm you can do

00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,590
it with shred up Gamal if you want to do

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,170
your cluster with straight Y Amal more

00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:03,880
power to you I have other things to do

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:07,510
like sleep so I mean small things yes

00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,920
but a full cluster no so but that is you

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,250
know that is where they go and where

00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,250
they come from

00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:24,490
um honestly I have to go look at where

00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,080
it's configured so yeah that's just

00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,630
something that I have not I have not

00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,030
poked at it and yet lab puts it all into

00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,890
a nice dashboard so I don't have to it's

00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,940
outside my realm of concern and for

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,380
those of you who are us who are

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,600
full-time software engineers you know

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,040
that there's plenty of concerns on your

00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,020
plate at all times so if you don't have

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,850
to think about it you don't until it

00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,170
becomes a problem which is how I

00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:48,040
basically learned a lot of this stuff

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:49,930
was right because again when you first

00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,540
look at the cloud it's kind of it's not

00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,320
that it's scary it's just different and

00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,490
learning that it's the same it's the

00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,200
whole that's why I wanted to give this

00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,870
talk he's learning that it's just the

00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,600
same old stuff makes it so much less

00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:10,020
threatening and so much more easy to

00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:10,020
deal with any other questions yes sir

00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:19,010
so the question is is there a container

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:22,350
technology more secure than docker and

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:25,500
the I'm gonna kind of hedge my answer

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:28,650
here a little bit so Runcie is being

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,800
written to do more of that that is a

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:33,780
technology coming out from being led up

00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,730
by the same guy that was known as mr. SC

00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,400
Linux so he knows a thing or two about

00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,230
being safe and secure and I have a great

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,180
deal of respect his name is Dan Walsh if

00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,770
you look for his stuff I see that his

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,040
coloring book there's also the container

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:49,410
coloring book right dan knows his stuff

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,910
and I have a lot of respect for him and

00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,050
I learned a lot from him because I was

00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:56,040
in the same office with him for four

00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:58,140
years so he said he's a good guy I'm not

00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,970
gonna say that it's more secure because

00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,060
I have not vetted it myself and that is

00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:06,780
a big thing again vet your containers

00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:11,550
look at your runtime but it's the cloud

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:13,560
and honestly as fast as we secure things

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:16,440
folks will unsecure them just as fast

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,000
behind us so right now I'm not going to

00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,510
endorse one over the other because quite

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,890
frankly you know no one has a long

00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,140
enough proven track record I mean the

00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,480
club we're using kubernetes in

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,570
production I mean yes it's been the hot

00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,250
thing we all talk about for years now

00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:36,360
but as far as proved out in production

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,520
think the only folks that have really

00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,680
done that are Google because kubernetes

00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,110
from my understanding is based on Borg

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,180
and Borg is how Cobra is basically

00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,490
kubernetes on a very much larger scale

00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,320
run at Google and that was the precursor

00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,920
to the open source company's project

00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,540
okay and I have not worked there so I

00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,930
you know I just don't have that

00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,760
experience but that's kind of my answer

00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:02,400
I know it's a kind of a cop-out but I'd

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,400
rather not steer you wrong because in my

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,120
mind all software is fallible for one

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:13,260
very good reason if you're perfect raise

00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:15,210
your hand we write the code so all

00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,880
software is fallible and that fact that

00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,770
earlier question what's what tips about

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,720
security

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:25,020
we're fallible so just always look at

00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,870
everything with a deep deep skepticism

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,490
and remember that as good as it sounds

00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:32,460
as much as we talk about stuff and

00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:34,710
polish it up on stage conferences it's

00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,930
stuff written by human beings who are

00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,960
inherently fallible and we've all had

00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,580
that brain-dead moment right like last

00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,990
night when for two hours I was trying to

00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,550
go through and just run through the live

00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,620
demo and tore my cluster down and

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,410
couldn't figure out why and I forgot to

00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,310
put the secrets in which let containers

00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,650
talk to each other cast the

00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:55,380
cryptographic keys I've been doing this

00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,600
forever and I even I forget stuff right

00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,370
so that's the thing don't be afraid to

00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,470
acknowledge what you don't know don't be

00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,240
afraid to make those mistakes

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,890
acknowledge them own them move forward

00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,500
right and that's the really the best

00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,670
security only made transparency right

00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,320
because when you start trying to hide

00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:13,760
this stuff or say oh this is better and

00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:16,140
get dogmatic about a particular platform

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,810
that's that's when it comes back to get

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,090
you right we all do our best but there's

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,650
no such thing as a best platform right

00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,330
there's no such thing there are better

00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,280
platforms but there are no perfect

00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:32,780
platforms and we can all learn from each

00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,780
other so any other questions yes sir

00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:22,520
so the self-declared antagonistic

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,080
question which by the way is the most

00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,580
respectful antagonistic question I've

00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,290
ever received so thank you for being

00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,290
respectful is this

00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,450
so given a I'm not going to quote Oliver

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,490
but a various laundry list of people who

00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,870
have very good security credentials say

00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,310
that you should never run containers in

00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:40,310
production and how do I feel about that

00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:43,040
and my response to that is to be

00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,630
certainly quasi antagonistic the DoD

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,160
still uses 8 and a quarter and strives

00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,510
for the nuclear arsenal because they

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,480
don't trust anything else with nuclear

00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:52,130
arsenal and they've never upgraded

00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,440
sometimes you have to be that paranoid

00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,720
for a lot of things you don't

00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,830
necessarily have to be you have to be

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,180
responsive and we you know any good cook

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,250
will tell you to make an omelet you have

00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,350
to break some eggs so we have to make

00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:10,130
these choices now the difference is are

00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:12,050
we being mindful of what we're doing and

00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,300
I think this is a conversation for those

00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,370
of you if it's your first time I'll just

00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,260
say this now these two our talks are

00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,610
great the hallway track next year when

00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,290
you come back the hallway tracks where

00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,270
you learn a lot more okay

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,620
there's a lot more in the hallway too so

00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,600
if you don't I see a talk you really

00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:31,210
want talk to people in the hall because

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:34,190
it's awesome but the thing is that the

00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,660
the software profession in general we're

00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,770
one of the only professions where you

00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,780
can do it as a hobbyist

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,060
think about like my friend is a licensed

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,850
civil engineer he has to have a licensed

00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:47,180
PE when he signs in the dotted line if

00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:48,920
he's wrong people die right I am from

00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,600
the state of Florida and we had this

00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,240
bridge that collapsed even though the

00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:56,060
engineers signed off on it people died

00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,070
because the engineer made a mistake when

00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,630
we make mistakes and what we do you

00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:02,840
could have banking information lost

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:05,300
personal lives destroyed savings so the

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,520
question is those security folks are

00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,930
absolutely right but I think part of

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,870
that goes back to you we need to treat

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:14,720
our profession like engineering where we

00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,280
take the same level of care and that's

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,130
one of the things that I really like

00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,290
with where I'm at now is that we you

00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,700
know everyone I collaborate with has

00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:24,790
that level of care they're looking to

00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,820
that it's important to them and I think

00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:29,770
that if we propagate that through the

00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,630
culture of software engineering

00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,640
it'll get better but from their

00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:36,090
perspective they're absolutely right

00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:40,030
I mean running construction is

00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:41,380
inherently dangerous but so is

00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,320
everything else in the software world

00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:47,020
and the question is are we willing to

00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,390
figure it out and fix it and have the

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,580
rigor I mean you know the personal and

00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,680
academic rigor to make it better or are

00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:57,160
we just gonna have folks saying the sky

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,390
is falling it's okay we have to meet

00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,710
somewhere in the middle because we need

00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,510
things to be run and be able to on a

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,490
scale but we also need to satisfy those

00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,100
security concerns and I think that the

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:08,910
community after let's see heartbleed

00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,350
shellshock how many can we talk about

00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,000
eludes these earlier the cutesy little

00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,800
problems with their pictures and their

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,840
web pages how many of those are we gonna

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,180
have were take it seriously that's why

00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,100
the the Linux Foundation started funding

00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,660
things like open SSL bringing things

00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,970
under the fold let's be more rigorous

00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,850
about because all of open source has

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:31,960
that right NTP is a single person

00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:33,340
sitting in their house not funded what

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,690
happens if they decide they're done and

00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,410
want to retire and go fish on a lake

00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:40,440
somewhere NTP runs most of the internet

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:43,630
right I mean that's an important thing

00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:47,470
keeping time is important

00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:48,730
GPS requires it right most of our server

00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:52,420
systems require it

00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:53,530
banks definitely require it right so

00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,330
that question goes deeper than just

00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:57,760
containers I always say it's all

00:47:55,330 --> 00:48:00,340
software so when we pick on containers

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,960
it's because it's the new hotness but I

00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,370
would say that I would take their

00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,500
rallying cry if it's not state to run

00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:08,410
container production it's not safe to

00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,450
run software in production it's just not

00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,420
and I'm not saying this I'm not bashing

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,830
on our profession okay I'm a software

00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,500
I'm a software developer and engine and

00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,520
a software engineer but we need to take

00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,720
that more rigor and take that on

00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,670
ourselves right

00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,620
we need to own it and move it forward

00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,020
and your friends are absolutely right

00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,550
and and and right and that's the people

00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,260
leading the charge trying to educate the

00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,270
rest of the broader software community

00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,130
and I applaud them because that mean

00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:35,310
that message needs to be needs to get

00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,310
out

00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,230
yeah when a lot of that has allowed that

00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,809
with the advent of realized that

00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:05,420
namespace in containers only came about

00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:08,660
maybe two years ago possibly three

00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,680
that's a really new feature right I

00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,630
think about that

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,170
keeping processes this thinkin's

00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,910
separate in the kernel that's really

00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,440
important and containers didn't get

00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,349
there for the first you know eight nine

00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,599
ten years of their life right so and

00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:26,450
again this is what I said I have immense

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,009
respect for Dan Walsh because he is

00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:30,400
trying to bring that you know because

00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:33,289
selinux was part of security no

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,579
mandatory versus right you're talking

00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,349
about asked to control access control

00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:38,569
and he's the one trying to lead that

00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:41,859
charge on the container side get these

00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:45,109
things secured what are we doing right

00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:47,779
and that's you know but we have to do

00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:49,789
that work and at the end of the day you

00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:51,650
know you pick and choose your own risk

00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:54,589
and also there's a risk of not going to

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,539
market right because if you try if

00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:58,759
you're working at scale and you're

00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,500
running not with kubernetes you're

00:49:58,759 --> 00:50:02,750
porting around you're toting around that

00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,759
large thing of scripts and that really

00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,190
depends on how good are your admins

00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:09,769
right if you have a fleet of people who

00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,420
are educated in security and a fleet of

00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:14,089
people who know what they're doing you

00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,740
can do that well now welcome to a small

00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:17,539
to medium size business where it's some

00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,039
where it's some kid they hired out of

00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:20,240
college and said hey do this thing

00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,130
because we can we can afford to pay you

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,960
because you're a new guy or a new girl

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,599
right you're the new person we can

00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,660
afford to pay you because we just can't

00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:31,819
afford IT kubernetes if they're trying

00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,759
to scale later gives you a better shot

00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:36,920
at those inter operations not being

00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:39,769
terrible it's not saying it's the best

00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,670
but you know when faced with terrible

00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:42,670
and really terrible

00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:57,220
it's written well that again if written

00:50:53,470 --> 00:51:00,250
well I do a lot with ansible I'm ansible

00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,960
certified and I can't tell you how many

00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,870
play books I've seen that are just not

00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,910
ident ident means that it's always true

00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,350
like the state always goes back same

00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,910
thing for chef cookbooks I've been

00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,710
learning chef and I look out itself at

00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,230
the community I go that's up but that's

00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,540
not ident in now the Evangelist will

00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,310
talk about make sure to damp it in but

00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,530
remember the evangelists and the folks

00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:23,740
who are you know preaching this are not

00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:25,540
the ones doing the work and there's not

00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,100
enough education out there this is one

00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,680
of the big reasons why I'm an advocate

00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,940
for this conference it's a free open

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,250
conference where you can come and learn

00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,080
these skills so if your employer is just

00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:37,210
not paying for you to go learn this

00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,620
stuff you can come here and learn it

00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:41,680
from folks that do it at the highest

00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:43,180
levels for free right and I think that's

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,830
another thing again I'm probably getting

00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,780
preachy but that's a big thing in open

00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:48,430
source the power of open source is that

00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,710
we can educate people and bring them up

00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:53,050
to that level and yes those

00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,880
orchestration tools do a lot but the

00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:57,300
orchestration tools only is the good is

00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,910
the person is orchestrating right and

00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,950
that's why you know one Philharmonic is

00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,740
better than the other or one rendition

00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:07,510
of his song like my I used to be a music

00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,220
major so you know I love stuff

00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,480
orchestrated by rimsky-korsakov even if

00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,000
he didn't write it because he has a good

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,860
eye like his taste I also have his book

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,590
and orchestration but then there are

00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,600
other folks to orchestrate and you go

00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:21,280
did you listen to the original song like

00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,380
you know canto scored it the orchestra

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,820
what were you thinking we see the same

00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,160
thing with orchestration tools where

00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,630
they were it doesn't save you nothing

00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,210
saves you from a lack of understanding

00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:33,310
the process the security aspects what's

00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:35,410
going on so again I'm not trying to be

00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,900
combative here but again right it's it's

00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:39,400
that like to say the containers are bad

00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,850
assumes that everyone can do the other

00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,490
process perfectly well and I would say

00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:47,560
90% of the time it doesn't and it's not

00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:50,200
through malicious action it's through

00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,790
lack of education because this isn't

00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,130
taught right the biggest thing I've ever

00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:55,330
seen is people walk in they go I'm fresh

00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,780
out of college and here's what I'm gonna

00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,480
do

00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,680
do you know how to use git no

00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,180
do you know how to write maintainable

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,369
code they can be maintained by 15 other

00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,960
people or a thousand or a million right

00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:07,809
I mean how many open-source contributors

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,410
are out there no we're not teaching it

00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:13,210
in school right some schools do I've

00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,220
seen a couple of folks have come through

00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:17,109
as interns when I've mentored that did

00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,869
get that teaching in school but by and

00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:21,339
by far and large it is not the norm so

00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:22,750
we need to make that the norm and we do

00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:25,420
that through a community you know

00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,609
community involvement right and this is

00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,470
why I like on git lab we take community

00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:30,760
contributions all the time and one of

00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,960
the things that we do is we actually go

00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,490
through and give meaningful feedback

00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,230
because if you're going to join our

00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:37,270
community we watched a meaningful

00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,579
feedback because why would you join a

00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:42,010
community where it's just like that

00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:43,690
whatever right you want to be engaged

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,089
and I think that all of open-source

00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,710
needs to get better at that and we'll

00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:49,839
get a better we'll have less of the

00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:51,609
security folks sitting there going what

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,550
are they doing why are they doing that

00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:56,559
right I can't imagine how high I can

00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:58,329
I've got a couple of security friends

00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,500
that are dear DoD level jobs and every

00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:01,869
time they look at stuff they just want

00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,329
it makes them go drink because it's just

00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:06,369
what were people thinking so and

00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:08,650
security is a big deal like security is

00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:10,240
all of our responsibility so if you if

00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:12,849
you're if you're just getting started if

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,309
you have a security operations team and

00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:17,440
they say do this don't get mad at them

00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:19,059
ask them hey can you tell me what

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,920
explain what's going on and why of what

00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:23,230
should I be looking for learning the why

00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,700
and then they'll stop bothering you

00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,770
because you'll see it before they tell

00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,500
you and you'll also become a better

00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:31,180
asset to wherever project you're in

00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,130
right so I'm gonna get off my soapbox

00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,960
because I'm kind of a security nerd too

00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:39,220
so you know question here and I think we

00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,329
have four minutes and just going to time

00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,329
box out so we know go ahead

00:54:47,270 --> 00:55:02,370
yep so the comment here is that there's

00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:05,520
a great presentation by Dan Walsh the

00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:08,580
containers don't contain and it's

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,710
getting better but it's true right that

00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,980
this is why that's I mean his full-time

00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:17,820
job is working on containers project

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:20,730
atomic security right there are cadres

00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,160
of people across the container and

00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:26,520
Cabrini's ecosystem who are so whose

00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,680
sole job is make this better right

00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,180
because I mean we I think we just have

00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,370
one I remember what cutesy name it got

00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:35,340
but we just had one for kubernetes a

00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,930
security issue and basically nobody

00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,780
wants to have their favorite projects

00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:42,780
played all over the internet and shown

00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,400
hey look this thing is full of holes

00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,470
though use this proprietary thing

00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,290
instead that's right

00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,240
no never may not mind that it's a big

00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,500
black box that you know it's a clock

00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,780
tick or and it's an understood way do

00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:58,040
active isotope inside ticking away if

00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:00,690
you've never seen that talk look for

00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:03,240
open versus closed source and the atomic

00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,370
black box it's a great talk and it's

00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,140
really scary when you think about you

00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:08,640
know you know kind of what goes on

00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,950
between open source versus proprietary

00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:14,310
software and the illusion of security

00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:15,660
through obscurity right it is it is an

00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:19,890
illusion we lie to ourselves all the

00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:21,990
time so the questions

00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:23,550
I feel like this side of the room has

00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,020
been very active we've got time for one

00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:30,360
more

00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:32,370
anybody over here okay

00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,290
well with that I'm gonna say thank you

00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:37,500
very much for attending if it's your

00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:39,300
first time enjoy the Linux fest if you

00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,520
if you think of something later run me

00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,680
down the hall I'm more than open to

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,660
questions as is everybody else here have

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,500
a great rest of the conference enjoy

00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,500
yourself and stay safe

00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:26,299
