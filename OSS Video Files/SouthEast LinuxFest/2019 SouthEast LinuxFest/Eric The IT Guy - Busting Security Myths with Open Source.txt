Developers are constantly being asked to make more and more powerful applications. The more feature-rich the application, though, the more prone to risk it becomes. Many have thought the solution is to keep the code base locked up tight, that open source is undesirable. The truth, however, is quite the opposite! More eyes on code has proven to increase the quality and security of the modern application.

is there are there are companies there

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,379
are projects there are groups of people

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,330
there are individuals who use

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,240
proprietary software because they have

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,179
this notion in their head that

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,279
open-source software is not as secure

00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:20,699
it's less secure it's less quality it's

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,310
it's you know some people even go to go

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,580
as far as to say is it's a plaything and

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,189
so the that's a myth that's that's not

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,439
the case at all so we're gonna address a

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,850
few a few myths in here and maybe maybe

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,440
through discussion afterwards we can

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,090
come up with a few more because I feel

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,100
like this is something that needs to be

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,360
addressed while I was doing research for

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,250
this talk I was coming across articles

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,809
that that expressed exactly what I

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,610
wanted to say and then I looked at the

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,440
timestamp on the article some of them

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,030
were 2013 2015 so this this talk is an

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,309
issue that has been going on for years

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,500
and we really need to lay it to rest so

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,309
I tell you what right here today

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,229
Father's Day 2019 get south-east linux

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,729
fest are gonna lay these myths to rest

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:13,290
and no one's ever going to bring them up

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:16,049
again right or so we can hope right in

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,460
this last words so Who am I like I said

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,259
my name is Eric the IT guy

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,810
for my day job I'm a Solutions Architect

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,340
for git lab and get lab is a single

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,409
application for the entire DevOps

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,880
process so we have issues we have

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,439
project management we have code

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,909
repositories we have C ICD pipelines we

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,150
have security scanning we have

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,460
monitoring we have and by the end of the

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,079
year we'll have defend as well so we'll

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,450
be able to do some protections for your

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,369
application live while it's running so

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,960
I'm a Solutions Architect I'm basically

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,670
a sales engineer no relation to github

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm also an open source advocate I've

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,700
worked with the genome Foundation I've

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,759
worked with Jupiter Broadcasting the ass

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,700
NOAA show so some I know I know most

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,180
everybody here by this by now so I'm

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,130
really excited to talk to everyone about

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,840
security myths but one other thing I

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,160
think you should know about me is I

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,050
really hate shaving bear with me for a

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,590
moment and just I hate shaving it's

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,349
repent

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,910
it's time-consuming finding the right

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,180
razor and the right shaving cream it's

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,310
expensive is it's a pain and it's just a

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:28,290
pain and if you're like me if you shave

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,090
you look like you're 12 so I had this

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,530
thought while I was trying to get

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,590
cleaned up and make myself presentable

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,000
this morning it took some time to get

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,410
the girlfriend sign off before I was you

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
know presentable enough to come in front

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,650
of you all and I had this thought that

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,500
waterfall development is kind of a

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,569
little bit like shaving it's slow it's

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,760
prone to issues I mean how many of us

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,400
have have drawn blood from our own faces

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,769
while we're trying to shave is Waterfall

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,760
is non collaborative so so what does all

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:02,220
that mean Waterfall is has been the

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,599
standard for for application development

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,760
for years why the common answer I get

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,799
when I ask around is that's what we've

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,299
always done and that's that's a

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,170
mentality that needs to be laid to rest

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,940
just as much as just as much as the

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,420
these security myths that we're going to

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,430
address what that means is you spend a

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,130
couple of months writing up a project

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,260
plan you're going to define exactly

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,450
every task that you're going to have to

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,859
touch exactly how long every one of

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,459
those tasks are going to take to

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,769
complete and after the after a couple of

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,359
months of sitting through meetings doing

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,250
that meanwhile you're spending all of

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,930
your debt all of your non meeting time

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,420
trying to keep up the legacy garbage

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,069
that's that's falling apart and then you

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,900
spend a few months writing the

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,910
application building new databases

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,859
deploying new servers to your non

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,180
production environment and you write all

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,780
your application you put in all your

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,130
features and then after three or four

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,200
months that was only supposed to take

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,930
two because that's what your your

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,109
project plan said then you realize oh

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,540
wait this is my stuff vulnerable we

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:12,299
should probably security scan this stuff

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,250
so then begrudging lee debt the dev team

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,190
goes over to the security group to the

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,900
security group and says hey we've got

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,100
this thing and we need ask and like

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,710
yesterday because we're over budget

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,460
we're over we're over time we need the

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:31,889
scanned now so security wedges and

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:33,960
their schedule and and they scan it and

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,610
you they find dozens and dozens of

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,590
vulnerabilities some of them dating back

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,770
years a lot of them are high severity

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,530
issues that can lead to data breaches

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,150
that could lead to do s attacks and then

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,940
you have to go back and remember the

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,110
code that you wrote three months ago

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,370
which I don't know about you but I can't

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,740
remember what I had for breakfast

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,160
yesterday maybe even today depends on

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,870
the day so how many of us can go back

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,550
and look at code we wrote three months

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,520
ago and find the security vulnerability

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,030
to fix it now we're even more over

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,949
budget now or even more over time

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,449
management's getting angry operations is

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,190
getting frustrated because the legacy

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,840
system continues to go down every other

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,759
day you're to the point where you just

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,289
you wake up in the morning you reboot a

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,419
server you go to lunch you reboot a

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:20,009
server you got back from you you you

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,479
spend dinner with your family you reboot

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:25,620
a server just to keep that legacy

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,240
environment running meanwhile your

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,590
customers are starting to look at

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,330
competition because the features you

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,169
promised them six months ago that would

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,539
be ready in three are now overdue so how

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:40,289
many of you in the audience have gone

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,759
through this nightmare how many of you

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:44,849
have gone through this nightmare more

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,500
than once I feel like I've been a

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,630
systems engineer for 10 years before I

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,449
came to get luck which by the way I'm

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,729
not selling gitlab I'm just relating a

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,449
relating feeling so your wallets are

00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:00,360
safe but I I've I've been a systems

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:03,449
engineer for 10 years and to be honest I

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,580
got burned out on it because while

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,099
development and security and project

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,020
management are doing their thing I'm the

00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,880
one who gets a call at 2:00 a.m. when

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,830
the application goes down I'm the one

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,070
who gets called on the weekends to try

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,719
and revive a database server that no one

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,969
really cares about but it has to be up

00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:22,560
by 8 a.m. on Monday because the two

00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,630
people in the company that still use

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,259
that application desperately need it

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,000
even if they don't I mean I can tell by

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,909
the looks on people's faces this is not

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,820
news to most of us we've all felt this

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:38,830
pain so what how do we fix this how do

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:49,460
we change this well

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:51,050
number of years ago yeah it took me

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,660
about 10 minutes to put that into the

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,960
end of the talk but all my fellow dad's

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,580
out there no no that song and it's it's

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,900
now going through the back of our heads

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,490
as we're talking about security so a few

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,050
years ago some folks got together at a

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,060
conference very similar to this and they

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,550
sat down and they said this is stupid

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,380
why are we doing this didn't we and

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,030
didn't we come up with technology didn't

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,190
we build computers to make our lives

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,370
easier and now we're working more hours

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,110
we're up more times than ever divorce

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,300
rates are skyrocketing I haven't seen my

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,640
kids in a month I don't remember what it

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,350
means to work an 8 to 5 job anymore

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,360
because this is the world that we live

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,060
in we live in this monolithic waterfall

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,040
world that doesn't do justice for

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,960
anybody the developers don't like it

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,060
the system is administrators don't like

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,710
it the customers don't like it nobody

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,760
likes it but we still do it because

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,800
that's what we've always done so this

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,160
this philosophy of DevOps has come along

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,960
it's it's it's highs into a july's into

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,970
safe it ties into some of these some of

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,790
these develop methodologies but it's

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,560
gotten a bad rap because I the last

00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,810
company I worked out my boss said the

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,860
DevOps was just a hippie notion of a

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,590
bunch of people sitting around a

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,320
campfire daydreaming it's like okay well

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,330
I'm way to take something that people

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,460
have been working on and studying and

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,590
iterating on for years and then just

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,950
throw it away

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,080
really really forward-thinking so DevOps

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,960
may have this this notion of being shiny

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,000
but let me tell you it really changes

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,710
the course of your of your business when

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,419
you adopt some of these principles and

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,400
that's what they are DevOps is a

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,050
philosophy it's not a tool it's not an

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,300
application that you can install it's

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,099
not it's not a program that you go

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,250
through and get certified it's a thing

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,750
it's a way of thinking it's a philosophy

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,169
DevOps is a way of doing business in

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,880
fact to tie things back into why we're

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,500
here

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,780
DevOps wouldn't exist without the open

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,560
source community be that Foss or just

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,400
straight OSS let's make it equivalency

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,320
if real quick

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,510
not talking about dollar value I'm just

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,770
talking about source code so open-source

00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,540
software and free and open source

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,730
software well I'm talking about both

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,520
right now

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,520
DevOps created a community within within

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,670
Enterprise IT to change the way that we

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,280
do work now instead of spending months

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,430
building a project plan that within the

00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,140
first week is already overdue we take

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,470
one issue at a time we take one feature

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,840
at a time and we iterate on that we put

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,670
something down on paper basically get

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,680
something onto a server that people can

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,930
look at can play with and tweak and then

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,520
you take issues you create issues you

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,860
make pull requests you add new features

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,990
you you scan these applications as

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,300
you're developing them so that it's

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,310
secure from the start so that is open

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,690
source from the start so that it works

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:48,770
from the start and then you add to it

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:51,020
from there so this sounds great we're

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,460
giving up waterfall we're we're done

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,140
with the monolith we're going to break

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,910
our application down into smaller more

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,560
manageable pieces we're going to break

00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,930
those applications down into smaller

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,030
processes the processes we can make

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,340
changes to we can take one issue at a

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,460
time work it till it's done and move on

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,190
to the next so this sounds great

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,320
it's been working companies out there or

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,580
iterating faster and faster and faster

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,990
I mean Netflix went from a DVD rental

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,550
service to an open-source just a monster

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,280
in this industry and I don't I don't

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,170
mean monster and negative sense they are

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,430
huge in the space and they're open

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,710
sourcing more and more of their tools

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,590
all the time so if this makes so much

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,490
sense if this is such a good idea

00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,490
why are we still having this

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,400
conversation there are still people out

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,420
there that don't think that open-source

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:48,200
is secure enough for their business and

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,630
it turns out that the reasons that

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,510
they're using can be quantified and they

00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:58,070
can they can be analyzed and pretty much

00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:00,080
disproven so let's let's dive in let's

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,660
look at a few we'll go from there and

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,290
like I said today we're going to squash

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,290
these issues

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:11,200
so the first issue that I hear and this

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,610
came up time and time again in my

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,870
research this came up time and time

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,620
again in the people that I talked to you

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,300
about why why is open source only 20% of

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,100
what you're doing why is it only 30 or

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,770
40 percent why is it not a hundred

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,020
percent of what you're doing one of the

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,720
common responses I got was I can't make

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,450
sense of the licenses now I don't know

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,670
about you all but I can't imagine why I

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,520
mean if you just go to open source com

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,330
they have a list of a bunch of them off

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,450
the main page

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,570
they've got BSD - BSD 3 Apache - Apple

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:48,190
public Eclipse one Eclipse - a GPL 3 GPL

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:51,700
- GPL 3 IBM MIT OSL 3 s SPL and soap oh

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:56,650
my I mean how could how can anyone not

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,690
make sense of any of that right ok so

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:02,020
from that research I was like ok yeah I

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,820
can understand that's a lot so what do

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,180
you have to do in order to make sense of

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,620
everything first if you're if you're

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,730
going to use open source licensing you

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,420
kind of have to break it down into two

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,760
categories

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,780
there's copyleft and permissive so

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,790
copyleft if I found this quote and I had

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,460
to use it it's it's cited in my in my

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,730
notes but if the source is open so must

00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:27,400
your code be apparently Yoda is now a

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,800
developer so what that means is if the

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,220
project that you're using has an open

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,230
source copyleft license then you need to

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,460
follow suit you have to license yours

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,800
the same way and you have to give credit

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,600
back if it's a permissive license on the

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,910
other hand anything goes you have the

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,850
right to use it modify it redistribute

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,280
it you don't necessarily have to give

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,350
credit back but because this is an open

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,660
source community its kind of encouraged

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,760
in fact you're seeing more and more

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,240
companies and more and more projects and

00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,660
communities get out because they are not

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,210
following the intention behind behind

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,500
the licensing so we're seeing more and

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:11,710
more fracturing within our community

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,150
so I found some resources and just just

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,250
a heads up I'm talking about open source

00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,410
and security this talk itself is open

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,000
source at the end of the slide at the

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,209
end of the slide deck I've got a link to

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,309
the

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,679
talk where you can download it use it

00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:26,949
give it somewhere else give me feedback

00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,660
back I'm this this talk just as much as

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:31,449
just as much as the content the talk is

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,429
open-source so I've got some resources

00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:36,040
listed out things like going to open

00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,660
source dot org slash licenses there's a

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,040
book published by O'Reilly called

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,269
understanding open source and free

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,600
software licensing there's always our

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:49,600
friend Google or DuckDuckGo search

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,980
engine of your choice in fact if this is

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,959
important enough to your business and

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,939
you're getting enough pushback from your

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,399
from your leadership there are actually

00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:59,379
attorneys that specialize in open source

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,899
licensing and you can find them through

00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,999
a lot of the foundations that the we

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,059
work with the Free Software Foundation

00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:09,189
has a booth and I'm sure that the the

00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,589
FSF can help you find an attorney who

00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:14,709
can help you talk through that so

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:18,279
everybody loves licensing but with that

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:20,410
being said I'll leave that for for your

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,689
particular use cases your particular

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,459
companies to kind of figure out what

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:27,100
what's the best license type of

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:30,399
applications can you use but we're going

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,069
to move on to the next to the next open

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,170
source myth it's developed by amateurs

00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:36,490
open source software is all just a bunch

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,709
of kids playing around on their

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,019
computers on the weekend when most kids

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,610
are outside playing that's kind of the

00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:45,040
mentality that people think of when they

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,920
look in an open source project nothing

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,230
could be further from the truth I mean

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,540
there is some of that but for the most

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,519
part I know a lot of open-source

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,129
developers I know I've worked with a lot

00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,389
of projects in this community and what

00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,549
you find is not a bunch of amateurs

00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:03,759
sitting in their basement at the age of

00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:05,410
40 developing code on the weekends while

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,499
they go deliver pizzas during the week

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,189
no it is the exact opposite the open

00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:14,589
source community is full of passionate

00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:16,540
brilliant people and why do they do what

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:19,990
they do open source doesn't mean you get

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,779
paid open source is typically free so

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,220
why do they do what they do they have an

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,600
itch to scratch there's something that

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,009
they're interested in learning there's

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,839
something there they're interested in

00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,759
doing and that usually leads to a

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,020
passion project there's something

00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,640
there's a need out

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,880
there's a there's a niche that needs to

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,740
be filled there's there's a gap in our

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,570
in our technology stack and there's

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,790
someone out there that that hits really

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,860
close to home to them and to their

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,589
skillset and they become very very

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,899
passionate to the point where they they

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:51,850
start up patreon accounts to ask for

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,950
donations so they can spend more time on

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,060
this project that to me doesn't sound

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:59,500
like somebody who's just sitting in

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:04,510
their parents basement another one I

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:07,660
like I here OSS can't scale boss and OSS

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,910
doesn't scale it works great if if you

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,550
you know you're running some podcasting

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:16,029
group it worked great if you've got five

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,800
or ten people I've got a few a few

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,270
companies on my list here that might

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,760
disagree you might have heard of them

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:27,730
Amazon Google Facebook people like this

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,339
might disagree got a couple of others

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:35,709
you might recognize WordPress WordPress

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:38,100
is I think 70ish percent of all web

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,089
hosting right now they're open source

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,910
another one you might have heard of is

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:46,750
Netflix if you go to Netflix that github

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,100
do you can find a lot of their tools and

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,730
they're open sourcing more and more of

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,220
their tool stack every single day so for

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,380
those of us in the security space you

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,079
might have heard of chaos monkey chaos

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,959
monkey is a really cool application

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,809
chaos monkey runs rampant on Netflix as

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:07,150
infrastructure so if you if you haven't

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,809
heard of chaos monkey I highly recommend

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,240
checking it out

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,970
basically it runs around and within

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,640
defined parameters causes chaos within

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,620
your production network not non

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,790
production not development not your

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,910
pre-production environment

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:24,550
uh-uh production it goes and it's down

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,429
entire virtual machines kill processes

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:30,220
at random it really develops chaos and

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,630
it's not just designed to it's not

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,340
designed for job security for the

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,270
systems administrators although it

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:40,059
sounds like work that way too but but

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,970
instead it's it is designed to help you

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,010
learn and develop more robust

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,850
infrastructure chaos monkey is designed

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,590
to help

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,380
make sure that your environment can

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,200
withstand random failures because

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,430
another question of when that disk is

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,290
going to fail it's not a question of

00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,750
when that application is going to run

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,310
out of memory it's a question of or it's

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,160
it's not a question of if it's a

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:05,230
question of when it will happen you have

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,330
to plan for these things and a tool like

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,630
chaos monkey will help you do that every

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:14,860
time you go out and binge watch the

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,300
Orval on Netflix you can actually I'm

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,970
not sure if Orville's on Netflix but

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,960
next next time you go and binge watch

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,960
whatever you want to watch on Netflix

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,710
next time you go out and binge watch

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,440
your favorite show on Netflix just think

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,540
of what it takes to store that media

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,730
stream that media out to you and then

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,040
multiply that by what 10 million or

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,230
however many subscribes or Netflix has

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,270
right now and you have an idea of how

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,280
fast their infrastructure is and then

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,010
multiply that onto a global scale and

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,290
then think about how dangerous it would

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,270
be if their database cluster went down

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,620
they have to plan for these kinds of

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,600
things and a tool like chaos monkey

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,460
helps do that why do I believe her at

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,980
this point because that tools

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,140
open-source you can go and use it today

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,460
so you can't sit there and tell me that

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:07,270
Foss doesn't scale the next the next the

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,280
next myth is there's no support this

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,950
application is out there just lives and

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,240
it just lives in the ether and and you

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,060
know what you what you see is what you

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:20,260
get the the outdated documentation the

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,670
the the the tutorials that don't ever

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,980
give you the output that you expect

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:29,410
that's that's what you get to an extent

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,290
I can see how this might be true a lot

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,450
of lot of businesses well let's be real

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,280
a lot of companies are just looking for

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,780
someone to blame they want to be able to

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,160
pick up the phone and know that there's

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,600
a number that they can call and there's

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,490
someone on the other end of that phone

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,090
that they can basically chew out for

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,830
their problem now that's really what's

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:55,810
going on in the business world we call

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:58,370
that an SLA right exactly we right we've

00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:01,040
all used that we've we've all needed

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,770
know that on a serious note we all need

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,330
to know that if an issue comes up and we

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,770
can't solve it ourselves we need to know

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,660
that there's someone we can reach out to

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:12,650
someone that we can open a ticket and

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:18,860
send logs to and actually and actually

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:20,480
get it and actually get a response but

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,040
again I would argue that that's not

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,900
entirely true this one's harder to

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,550
dispute because that's true open source

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,680
software is kind of what you see is what

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,090
you get but it's a community effort and

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,700
that's something that we've forgotten

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,860
when we go it's something that we love

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,210
and celebrate on the weekends when we're

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,370
running on our linux stops it's

00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,740
something that we we love to talk about

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,570
until 2:00 in the morning when we're at

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,770
a conference like this but for some

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,260
reason when we get back to our

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,970
businesses on the on the following week

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,020
and we get back into that Enterprise

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,190
mindset this is something we forget

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,250
open-source is still a community it

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:57,950
doesn't matter if it doesn't matter if

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,809
if if you're using it for personal use

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,250
or business use it's a community the

00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:03,650
more that we can work together the more

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,360
that we can work through these bugs the

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,280
more that we can we can address these

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,870
issues as a community the better the

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,130
software we're going to get which means

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,840
the better the products that our

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,480
businesses are going to be able to use

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,450
when we go to use our use open-source to

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,240
build our projects so where where can we

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,550
go to to negate this particular myth

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,490
there's telegram groups there's IRC s

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,980
there's forums there's issue boards if

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,840
you have an if you come across a bug and

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,320
you get an error message for the love of

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,620
Pete

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,210
please go create an issue developers of

00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,309
these open source projects can't fix an

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,690
issue that they don't know is there and

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,610
there's no way for these open-source

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,130
projects to be able to test for every

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:49,179
conceivable use case there's absolutely

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:51,950
no way in fact because we're here

00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:55,100
there's even a show that you can call

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,070
once a week and get help it's called the

00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,510
ask Noah show he's over at the booth you

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,220
can get his phone number and call on

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,350
Tuesday nights you can't tell me that

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,300
you cannot find support and it's not

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,880
just Noah that you can you get support

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,070
from it is amazing to be around this

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,110
community and see it at work I have seen

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,170
enterprise level issues

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,240
be addressed on the show and then not be

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,030
able to be resolved on the show but to

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,100
have a a subgroup in telegram form

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,320
spontaneously after the show and

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,900
engineers get together and talk about

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,760
this Enterprise issue and work its

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,780
resolution you cannot tell me that there

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,770
is not support available for open source

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,830
let's take a let's take a step back

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,720
let's let's look at it I've been kind of

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,940
talking in the abstract so let's let's

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,500
let's put the wheels let's put the

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,830
wheels on the road for a second how many

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,630
of us remember heartbleed how many of us

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:51,530
lost a lot of sleep while trying to fix

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:53,360
heartbleed so so for those of us that

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,860
don't know heartbleed was disclosed in

00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:01,880
2014 before I get into that let me back

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:05,650
up a second heartbleed affected secure

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:09,110
web traffic across the Internet in 2014

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:11,510
because basically the open SSL library

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,340
provides and provides the ability to

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,100
encrypt traffic between a client and a

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,960
server and while that connection while

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,310
that secure tunnel is open and it's

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,290
great to think about it in terms of a

00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,790
tunnel because it makes because if that

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,330
tunnel is not being used is going to get

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,360
shut down

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,160
so the client as long as as long as

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,410
you've got that tab open on your browser

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,200
that client is sending a heartbeat a

00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,470
keepalive packet back to the server

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,510
it basically says hi I'm still here and

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:42,050
I'm sending you an encrypted payload of

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:44,150
40 bytes please send that back to me the

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,310
server receives the packet and says ok

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,350
hi I see you're still here here's your

00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:52,330
40 bytes of encrypted data back they

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:54,380
they do the check if it checks out great

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,770
if there's no response

00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:02,210
the tunnels closed and terminated so

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:04,250
what what heartbleed would do is it

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,820
would say hey I'm sending you 40 bytes

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,620
please send me 40 bytes back but when it

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,470
what heartbleed would do instead is

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,680
please send me I'm sending you 40 bytes

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,570
please send me 120 bites back now that

00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,120
doesn't sound too dangerous in and of

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,680
itself but think about this you've got

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,540
all these heartbeat checks going from

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,070
client to server so if you've got 20

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,910
people you've got 20 of those every

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,660
some-odd seconds

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:32,900
but what you also have is you have

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,720
usernames passwords Social Security

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,000
numbers email addresses home addresses

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,190
you've got all kinds of information to

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,980
scale that up say hey I'm still here

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,840
send me 20 bytes of encrypted data or

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,270
here's mine 20 bytes of encrypted data

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,120
send me 200 bytes of encrypted data back

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,980
and you you can scour through that and

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,740
find all this personally identifiable

00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:57,440
information now that's a big issue

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:01,370
you know when it came down to there was

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:05,000
there was some poor coding shall we say

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:07,250
in the open SSL library where there was

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,870
not a check to ensure that the amount of

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,510
data sent was the amount of data

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,690
requested all it was was basically an

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:17,030
if-then statement that was missing now

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,760
you would think that open SSL being as

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:24,590
critical of a library as it is could

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,890
been able to check that but open SSL is

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:31,370
responsible for virtually all of the

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,990
encrypted traffic on the web but they

00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,360
only have them 1 million dollar budget

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:41,470
and 11 full-time developers that is a

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:44,390
huge undertaking for what to pieces so

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,280
to ask those 11 people to be able to

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,770
foresee every possible vulnerability

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,770
doesn't make sense you know what saved a

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,990
lot of people's data when the heartbleed

00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,660
scare came up the fact that the library

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,160
was open source people in the community

00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,900
were able to figure out what was going

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,680
on take the information they were seeing

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,050
on the Internet

00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,810
go through the code and find that there

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,460
was just this definition it was just

00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,400
this line of code that defined the

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:16,130
variable and instead was able to create

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,630
just a simple if-then statement so is

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,310
open source software really a more

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:23,990
secure in theory on paper yes definitely

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,430
because look at a heartbleed if those 11

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,890
people were the only people that had

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,330
access to that code it may have taken a

00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,500
whole lot longer and a whole lot more

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,630
people's lives could have been turned

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,640
upside down because of heartbleed but it

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,370
was open source so instead of 11 people

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,530
you had 1100 people whatever the number

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,809
maybe you had a whole lot more eyes

00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,789
on that code than you would have if it

00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,830
was proprietary now if all of our

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:47,539
libraries if all of our applications if

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,059
all of our tools if all of our operating

00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,580
systems were proprietary you are hoping

00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,960
the the team that is developing that

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,720
particular library or that particular

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,600
tool has the time and the knowledge and

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,260
the depth of experience to foresee every

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,730
single possible outcome I don't see that

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,799
happening I look at I look at get lab

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,909
and I use this not because I work there

00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,770
and because I'm trying to sell you

00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,880
anything I'm using this example because

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:17,809
it's something I deal with on a daily

00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,990
basis we have 600 people plus now in

00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:22,820
that work forged lab only about a third

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,720
of those work in product engineering I'm

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,400
sure a lot of you can relate there's for

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,070
every for every engineer there's a

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,900
Salesman there's a there's someone who

00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,539
works for HR there's someone who works

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,520
as a manager so product engineering is a

00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:39,830
very small piece of that get lab would

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,030
not be where it is today if the if it

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,299
weren't for the fact that get lab was

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,860
open core so while we may only have two

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:47,600
hundred some-odd engineers or in

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,090
developers working on application itself

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,030
we have over two thousand people that

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:56,929
have contributed code features bugs

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,360
issue requests documentation tutorials

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:02,120
to our product to help make it better

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,919
two hundred versus two thousand and I'm

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,320
sure all of our applications I'm sure

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,760
all of us can see something similar in

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,230
in the world in which we work the other

00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,710
question you have to ask yourself is

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,440
what's the cost if this goes down do I

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,440
do I want my company's livelihood to be

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,510
dependent upon 20 or 30 so developers or

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,020
do I want that tool to be open-source

00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:29,539
and be able to get people's people's

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,700
opinions and ideas from all over the

00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:34,780
globe from all walks of life people that

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,520
are Python developers go developers

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,600
people that have worked on iOS people

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,010
that have worked with Android people

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,500
that have work on Windows people that

00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,880
work on Linux all of those different all

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,049
those different backgrounds can

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,549
contribute to what we're doing so you

00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,440
want do you want the financial

00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:52,630
livelihood of your company to be

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,520
dependent upon your

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:58,429
whose resources are limited or do you

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,370
want to give it out to or do you want to

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:03,980
give it out to to the community who can

00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,270
help not because you're paying them but

00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:11,150
because they are passionate about your

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:13,040
product so we talked a lot about DevOps

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,049
we talked a lot about open source we

00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,390
talked about some security we talked

00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:20,450
about an actual we talked about a couple

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:23,299
of case studies so here's here's my

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:25,760
here's my request we're in an open

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:27,700
source conference we're talking about

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,309
our love for Linux we're talking about

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:34,190
tools and we're sharing ideas so here's

00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:35,390
mine as someone who's worked in the open

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,160
source community and it's talk to

00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,960
developers and talk to just how much

00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,150
they're trying to accomplish and how

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,280
overwhelming the list of notifications

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,679
and pull requests and everything can be

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,559
for their for their software we need

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,510
more we need more folks to contribute

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,070
back and you know we're you know where

00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,970
we need the most help right now

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,049
it's insecurity so let me let me take a

00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,549
quick poll of the room I should have

00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:03,260
done this to start but how many how many

00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:08,030
systems engineers do I have awesome

00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,049
developers few of you hopefully you

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:13,400
didn't feel like I picked on you too

00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:14,720
much network engineers okay good because

00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:20,960
it's always their fault when the network

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:25,130
goes down in anybody in security a few

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:34,309
of you potentially okay i'ma just

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:37,210
enthusiasts okay so here's here's

00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:40,400
something to think about open source is

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,720
included in 90 plus percent of all

00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,150
applications that are out there right

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,919
now 90 plus percent has an open source

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,260
component whether that's a library

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,790
whether that's a tool whether that's a

00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:54,260
monitoring API some component of just

00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:58,910
about 90 plus percent of all

00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:02,059
applications are open source but I wish

00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:05,970
I couldn't find a number for this but

00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:09,330
based on based on traffic of emails and

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,129
and and reports from from breaches you

00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,080
know how many vulnerabilities are in

00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:15,720
every single every single one of those

00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,519
open source libraries the the number

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,929
would be would be breathtaking it would

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,690
be unbelievable

00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:23,549
just how far we need to go so for my

00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,129
security engineers in the room we need

00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:28,559
your help find an application that you

00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:30,450
use something that's open-source talk to

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,490
the talk to the talk to the release

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,830
coordinator talk to the developers see

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,269
how you can use your expertise to help

00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,549
make our open-source projects better

00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:41,159
because the more secure we are the

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:45,320
better the better the better and

00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,610
stronger of a community will be awesome

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,340
there there are tools out there that

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,500
give free licenses for open source

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,600
projects get labs one of them we've just

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,519
started doing we just started doing

00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,190
security scanning as part of our CI CD

00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,399
pipeline I think sonar cube

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,840
I think it's sonar cube has has free

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,789
licensing if if you're if you're

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,649
registered as an open source project a

00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:10,590
lot of these tools out there understand

00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:11,940
the value of the the foundation the open

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:15,720
source foundation that they're built off

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:18,509
of so find a project run some security

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,940
scans on it come up with some good valid

00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:23,970
reasons why that my that's an issue and

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:31,019
some suggested fixes let's make our

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:34,470
products more secure so it just as just

00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:37,049
as insight I like to practice what I

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,450
preach and so a lot of a lot of the

00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:41,759
tools that I'm using at home are are

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,679
going to be open sourced in fact this

00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,190
entire presentation is open source I

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,590
built it on open source tools and the

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,539
talk itself is actually available online

00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:53,190
along with some of the some of the

00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:58,200
reports that I read along with some of

00:32:53,190 --> 00:33:01,429
the blogs that I read so I invite you go

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,980
grab this talk use it at your companies

00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:07,200
give me some feedback submit issues to

00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,279
to make changes or if there's tools that

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,470
I didn't think of or if there's

00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:13,470
anecdotes case studies that should be

00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:15,769
addressed please give back to this talk

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,769
so

00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,970
I threw a lot of information out there a

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,129
lot of abstracts but the the kind of the

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,809
final thought to take away is security

00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:29,269
is always going to be an issue there's

00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,970
always going to need to be new ways to

00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:33,440
compromise software and people are

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,970
starting to understand the value of

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,279
their data they're starting to want to

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,860
move away from ad companies that just

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,779
give them services for free just to sell

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,210
their data for other uses people are

00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:46,549
starting to understand that their their

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,159
data is important and we need to do our

00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:51,980
job as IT professionals and as open

00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:56,990
source contributors to make our software

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,580
more secure so with that thank you very

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:02,629
much for your time and attention and I

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,299
we've got about 10 15 minutes or so I

00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:08,470
would welcome any questions any feedback

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:08,470
conversation yes sir

00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:44,179
so so the comment was that one of the

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,040
gentlemen in the audience and this is

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,780
mostly for the benefit of the stream in

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,750
the recording but one of the gentlemen

00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,120
in the audience is is a pen tester and

00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,100
he said that the Linux and open source

00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,290
stacks are usually the most secure if he

00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,450
finds an up-to-date Linux box he'll go

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,170
somewhere else and see if he can get in

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,350
other ways

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,600
unless it's WordPress um but you're

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,850
right proprietary software does have

00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,670
some vulnerabilities Linux as a whole

00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:14,240
Linux if you follow best practice does

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,370
have some some very deep-rooted security

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,560
principles within it and it's only

00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,630
getting better but if you give everyone

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,100
the root password and set the root

00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,440
password of the same thing across your

00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,210
entire enterprise that's a problem but

00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,220
if you follow best practice Linux is

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,440
inherently a secure operating system and

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,790
that's why we need to focus on where

00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,140
were weak things like WordPress plugins

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,340
things that we wouldn't always think

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,070
about would be a security of owner

00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:43,040
billing WordPress in and of itself

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:44,440
pretty secure one is and I say that

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,760
lightly

00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,310
where where WordPress starts to fall

00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,750
short is the plug-in infrastructure and

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,160
that's because most of those plugins are

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,880
developed by community members and

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,710
that's not to dog on community

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,180
contributions not at all but the problem

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,070
is we don't always think that a plug-in

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,420
is going to be vulnerable in fact that's

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,250
usually where things are the most

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,470
vulnerable so that's what we need to

00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:09,020
focus on our operating system itself is

00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,580
inherently secure so we need to focus on

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,770
where were weak and that's in the

00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,170
application stack that's looking at

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,750
these open source projects and improving

00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,190
the security on them in in fact in a lot

00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:21,470
of cases like with the heartbleed

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,870
situation the fix may be very very

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,730
simple you go from just setting a value

00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,160
to actually running a check against the

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,990
value before you said it I mean it was I

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,680
think it was like six lines of code

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:36,020
instead of one and and and that fixed

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,130
heartbleed so any other questions

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,130
comments feedback yes sir

00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:38,850
so the the comment in the room was that

00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:40,770
that hardware use our security used to

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,440
be baked into every level starting with

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:46,470
the hardware and I would agree

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,359
very very wholeheartedly because if you

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,820
think about if you think about how

00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,650
security has been treated in the

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,580
software development lifecycle where is

00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,619
it usually it's usually at the end so I

00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,720
would say that security needs to be

00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,820
pushed back up the up the hardware sack

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,890
it needs to be packed it needs to be

00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,750
pushed back up towards the front of

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,440
every project and that's something that

00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,090
DevOps

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,130
and open-source are trying to accomplish

00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,890
because if you're considering security

00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,420
from the start if you have if you have

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,060
an environment that's completely locked

00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,790
down and that's why docker containers

00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,380
have have have have grown so quickly

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,080
because they're inherently

00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,090
self-contained there's no way out you're

00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,520
stuck inside this container thus the

00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,990
name where the security becomes a

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,540
problem is when you start punching holes

00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,710
in that container so you don't need to

00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,540
punch more holes than you're actually

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,760
going to use you're not going to open up

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,440
a whole bunch of ports especially common

00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,290
ports if you're not actually going to

00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,300
use those ports so we need to go back to

00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,980
a mentality where security is at the

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,510
table from the beginning and that's what

00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,820
that's what this whole shift left

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,810
movement is about instead of set of

00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,190
security being at the end

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,290
of your pipeline it needs to be at the

00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,390
beginning security engineers need to be

00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,870
at the table operations engineers need

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:03,150
to be at the table the business the the

00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,860
leadership the developers they all need

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,630
to be at the table at the beginning to

00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,860
discuss this and instead of spending two

00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,200
months talking about what we're going to

00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,790
do we need to actually start building

00:39:10,200 --> 00:40:08,550
these applications sooner and running

00:39:11,790 --> 00:40:11,210
security checks after every commit just

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,210
talk a lot

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,450
right very sure the the problem is a lot

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,910
of our environments today have a great

00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,830
engineer and they sit over there they

00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,120
have a great security guy and they're

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,370
down the hall in their own room and

00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,790
there's a great developer and he sits at

00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:58,530
a building across campus and they never

00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:01,620
talk then

00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:05,040
so you mentioned DevOps right

00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,930
you mentioned DevOps and if if if you're

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,310
working with a DevOps team who then

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,050
comes to you after the project's done

00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,270
and asked you to scan they're not doing

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:15,540
it right I'll go on record and say that

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,070
it's harsh but it's true that's not the

00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,530
intention behind DevOps and that's why

00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:21,210
this that's why I had this the shiny

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,980
slide this is because people look at it

00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,240
and go oh that's cute I'm just going to

00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,850
go back to doing the work the way I was

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,890
you have to have everyone in the room at

00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,750
the same time that's why it's so

00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,000
important to have security at the table

00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:36,030
that's why it's important to a shift to

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,400
shift that process left so if you

00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:41,190
haven't read something like the DevOps

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,260
handbook or a much shorter read and more

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,730
interesting is a book called the Phoenix

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,680
project and that kind of talks about

00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,410
what DevOps is I see a few people

00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,290
nodding their heads in fact from for

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,730
myself as a systems engineer we used to

00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:56,190
fight this battle all the time and

00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:58,260
wonder why never why not nothing ever

00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,910
got done and why it was me getting cold

00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,710
on the weekends I was recommended this

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,590
book by a couple of people and I was I

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:07,490
was listening to this book I was like we

00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:10,200
just had the same conversation yesterday

00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,840
well now I understand why that server

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,000
keeps going down because the project

00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:18,750
that's supposed to replace it is a year

00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,960
behind so by moving by moving to more

00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,270
agile approach we can have faster more

00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,550
secure and in the end more feature full

00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:30,540
products that the customers can love and

00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:34,010
use sooner so I completely agree and I

00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,010
appreciate the feedback yes sir

00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:20,000
so so we can we can take this

00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:22,700
conversation we can we can reconvene a

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,589
friend if we want but I do want to let

00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,839
everyone else get to get a chance if if

00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:35,390
there's any other questions comments yes

00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:38,060
sir so get lab bought a company called

00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:39,740
gymnasium gymnasium is now incorporated

00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,750
into the product itself

00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:44,599
they basically became the start of the

00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,220
security team there's there's a couple

00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,359
of other scanning tools and I don't

00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,560
remember the names off the top my head

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,930
but agate lab out of the box will offer

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,460
SAST and DAST scanning so that's static

00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,800
application scanning and dynamic

00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,450
application scanning and they do exactly

00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,490
what they sound like they scan your

00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,680
application at the code level and then

00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,119
while it's actually running it does

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,670
container scanning if you're if you're

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,150
integrating with docker and so it'll run

00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:13,089
checks for for docker specific

00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:16,609
vulnerabilities there's license scanning

00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:18,640
that that does that checks to make sure

00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:20,750
that you don't have any blacklisted

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,880
licenses in your in your application

00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,589
code so you can you can actually set a

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,839
list you can define a list of I don't

00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:28,970
want to use Apache or I don't want to

00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:30,740
use Apple or whatever the case may be

00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,480
you can actually list those out and it

00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,369
will do a licensed can to verify that

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,280
all of your code is compliant with with

00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:38,720
what you've set forth and then by the

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,030
end of the year we're going to have I

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,329
asked so that's that's interactive

00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:48,349
application scanning basically that's

00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:50,329
going to try and send random inputs back

00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:52,339
to your application so it'll try to

00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:54,530
address things like stack overflows like

00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:58,339
sequel injections and things like that

00:45:54,530 --> 00:46:01,430
to try and and and basically forces way

00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:03,410
to log into your application so I don't

00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,900
remember the names of this specific

00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,560
tools and pretty much all those tools

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,110
are open sore

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,420
but they are they are kind of and they

00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:17,300
are integrated into the the application

00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:19,580
itself in ticket lab itself and not yet

00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,280
right now they are part of the ultimate

00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,470
tier but I've heard

00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,810
murmurings that that's going to be

00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,810
moving down into potentially the core

00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:32,960
just because of the specific problem

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,850
because we have because so much of our

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,010
infrastructure and I don't mean at the

00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,480
enterprise level I mean so much of our

00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,670
world is dependent upon these open

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,980
source projects and they're just not as

00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,420
secure as they need to be I mean you you

00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,120
look at some of the attacks that have

00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,580
been leveraged against power plants and

00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,980
government entities I mean an entire

00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,710
city was taken down because of because

00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,940
of a hack and a lot of that may have

00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,580
been caused by open source

00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,900
vulnerabilities so because of that get

their security tools into the core

00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:05,710
edition just to try and resolve some of

00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:11,690
