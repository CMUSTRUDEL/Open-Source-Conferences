Title: Alex Juarez - Tackling Training Needs with Open edX
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	2019 SouthEast LinuxFest; Open edX is the platform behind edX.org, one of the largest online learning websites and communities. Just because it powers one of the largest doesn't mean we can't use it to power some of the smallest.
 
In this session, we will go over how we can try out Open edX in a self-hosted environment for a small company or organization. Once we establish how we can try it out we will go over the ins and outs of administration, customization and course creation.
 
We will cover best practices in creating courses as well as how to create assessments. The best practices presented will be Open edX centered but will be something that can be used regardless of platform.
 
Attendees will be introduced to Open edX as a platform and be given guidance on how they can try it out for themselves.
 
If you are looking for a LMS/CMS platform or are looking for how to establish an internal learning platform there will be something for you in this presentation.
