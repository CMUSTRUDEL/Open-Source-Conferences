Title: Alex Juarez - Tackling Training Needs with Open edX
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	2019 SouthEast LinuxFest; Open edX is the platform behind edX.org, one of the largest online learning websites and communities. Just because it powers one of the largest doesn't mean we can't use it to power some of the smallest.
 
In this session, we will go over how we can try out Open edX in a self-hosted environment for a small company or organization. Once we establish how we can try it out we will go over the ins and outs of administration, customization and course creation.
 
We will cover best practices in creating courses as well as how to create assessments. The best practices presented will be Open edX centered but will be something that can be used regardless of platform.
 
Attendees will be introduced to Open edX as a platform and be given guidance on how they can try it out for themselves.
 
If you are looking for a LMS/CMS platform or are looking for how to establish an internal learning platform there will be something for you in this presentation.

Wi-Fi icon

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,110

this early but

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:38,870
so starting with the the what and the

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:47,550
why of 161 so talking about my spending

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:52,260
without talking about xorg especially

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:58,800
largest learning website where we be

00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:04,950
training in learning learning right and

so about bringing education and most the

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,840

faces lies are a so the link around

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:25,860
potentially a few sites close to each

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:28,640
other anybody knows those will link out

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:33,540
to the source of that question as well

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:36,690
right so found in 2012 EDX was a Madison

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,250
solid learning some work identified

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,700
amenities skill will learn enlarged

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:44,370
pores these twelve founded by a few very

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:48,150
large universities in 2012 that's what

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,190
edx.org is so open EDX oh that is the

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,420
infallible lips make sure enough the

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:59,280
Pope is wrong with their source

and you can see or another Li and little

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,570
Windex learn a machine quite suppose to

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:21,480
be a learning LMS wellness and the CMS

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:25,110
is what the this calcium use them to

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:29,430
create radio and that's what we use to

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,440
create content create courses so worried

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:39,360

to lobby consistent rise of knowledge we

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,330
wanted to at the time it was assistant

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,070
be process after trying to use it we

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,530
have the first time but was one that

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,300
wheels after trying to use it as our

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:28,040
objectives and for that but is employee

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,040

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:43,110
get started up so that it was sorry and

and try to get ready for that when they

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,130
might have questions about the whole

00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:02,009
process and the course will need to be

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,829
improved upon five easy to update in the

00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:07,440
process of your evening really a lot to

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:10,170

to say a divorce or we rose month of

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,730
time so we updated by time so we don't

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:24,569
know where you change the food for us

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:35,310
when we start looking at you open EDX

00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:36,810
right it's right now I'm going to try it

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:45,540
out and there's a lot that need to be

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:58,980
done together going using a full

00:09:45,540 --> 00:10:01,170
software package and courses we wanted

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,880
for the other courses as well as you

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,470
know three organs defined before the

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,350
other deep replaces book and have a

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,779
chance because we want to the Big D here

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:25,889
at the time we're just going self-paced

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:29,760
would have somebody with horses should

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:31,790
pay their party authentication but yes a

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,859
party

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,209
3 Rd throat mortgage my kids I could Sam

00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:37,619
a little well right that was important

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,879
for us to film also we're working on

00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:41,009
right now to try get that angry of

00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:48,949
service there couple ways that we can

00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:48,949
deploy open EDX so we can do it or to

00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:12,149
provide their business and partly that's

00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,480
been perfect business there's people

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,339
companies get as permit employment but

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,509
that's not what we want to do right

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,519
ourselves there are two options to

00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:27,449
ourselves right became pissed off from

00:11:23,519 --> 00:12:00,919
sources feed us or binami has says we're

00:11:27,449 --> 00:12:00,919
free interpretation I was doing my right

00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,660
with the URL

00:12:18,700 --> 00:13:52,240
requirements is to shortcut just looking

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:52,240
at here we won't do it as an install so

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:02,650
here is that you first can't do the but

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,650
you

00:14:03,139 --> 00:15:37,190
a few days ago so just some random

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,190
passage in recent release

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,339
because we're these it is required that

00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:46,249
we work here and my dad lastly which I

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,439
can translate over an hour then lastly

00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:58,309
which don't contain call over an hour

00:15:48,439 --> 00:16:01,220
right we look at the house yourself from

00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:02,689
here and do potentially a native this

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:08,679
all just from source

00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:19,339
what did milk here is that they in there

00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:24,800
isn't hiding past versions to a Java

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:27,949
version itself this already they are

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,670
working is pretty according to Python

00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:33,499
they don't work important here I've got

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,389
three the working to get in those offer

00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:37,389
versus update if it's not there yet

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:49,020
so about last night

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:53,040
I am i hey let's start I in my own

00:16:49,020 --> 00:17:06,030
wisdom let's blow my old ways

00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:24,900
that's what diggings and logs and

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:27,120
there's some libraries you to work out

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:43,050
few days figure that out we can there

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:46,020
might be some there's also an issue go

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:49,800
through the the LMS and CMS to what is

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:53,190
looks like oh you smell ms/ms wasn't

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:59,550
look like when we install so I did a

00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:01,610
demo install I will grant you in stores

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,710
I feel like this so when we come here

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:08,460
grant universities exposure option to

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:13,160
register very basic a boulder option two

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,160
registers around two

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,370
I'll come back to this slide this slide

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:23,410
is out of work but one talk about the

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:36,310
right so the learning um so one bugs me

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:39,990
that learner pretty quick party out

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:46,630
during a rich like it being said

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:50,740
as long as so example if it's mister and

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:57,010
so if this record he's right visitor as

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:58,770
a regular user as we saw and these

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:04,390
fields can be customized to be hidden

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:07,240
you can really really really no here's

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:15,210
what's wrong for us it was really named

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:15,210
you know but are even here so

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,860
ever this will be the strip in Finnmark

00:19:26,060 --> 00:22:07,350
so when you find anything that's better

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:19,260
so really Buell chance to go through a

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:27,810
course is either all text that we could

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:31,370
do evaluations the CMS portion or the

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,370
baggage on

00:22:51,950 --> 00:23:45,540
it was it was easy to was in our options

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,440
the getting a new version was inner

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,440
option at the time

00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:43,649
you simply go to you more studio or do

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,649
the course at the studio

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,260
okay

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,259
I wanted

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,000
so that doesn't work I hope you'll still

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,040
do any different area

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,460
so that doesn't work I'll go see the

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,460
engine area

00:25:43,470 --> 00:26:50,039
so all right so you'll see here that we

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:53,299
have different sections kind of set B is

00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,299
type of exam

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,809
[Music]

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,120
at you but this is really nice for us to

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:28,600
have to be able to say heavy wire this

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:30,520
is really heavy narration so happiness

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,470
we can say that hey this section should

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,160
be great as a knowledge check or as a

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:39,040
lattice a very great source of workers

00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,560
of that also say kind of that weight or

00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:46,480
source of work not hide hide hide

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:52,690
subsection hide the the only points go

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:55,480
to hang any cousin Ezra still I think

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:58,470
he's like the visible to live people

00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,470
rights to buy apartments

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,750
so

00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,910
so one of things that was also kind of

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:16,910
nice and it's not enabled for this

00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:16,910
course particularly when somebody's

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:26,310
having a nice little nicely pretty to

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,670
pay phone calls

00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:33,890
you are officially ready to take phone

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,890
calls or pop in to see we're back

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,509
so when we view live as an instructor we

00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,649
have options to look at

00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:04,450
Dolores trunk you could say we watched

00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:09,909
his balls look so for me involved he was

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:17,980
in a new crate I didn't do a great

00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:21,419
you go see who's past was not you see

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,649
who's past was not have options to do

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,169
information like you could download the

00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:48,820
course now it to a CBS say hey if I

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:51,639
would have my course from but if you say

00:29:48,820 --> 00:30:03,149
hey I have a certain user I don't want

00:29:51,639 --> 00:30:03,149
to do it with having a great report here

00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:07,499
yes

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:48,080
yes yes so this is kind of our internal

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:49,670
one so this is really use and we of

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,970
course we really tailored to how we

00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:55,060
operate and what army really told you

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,090
there how we operate whatever is fine

00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,750
fine it's simply there's a good job

00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:07,610
something that will either find

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:18,290
something they say or we write you then

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:20,690
say we need a lot of digitalocean

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,570
articles all the time first as we using

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,250
this part of the class discussion laid

00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,590
out there's a present the best

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:32,080
discussion account

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:34,480
laid out all right so let's talk about

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,770
some some day to operation right I'm hop

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:44,380
back so someday - wow thank you

00:31:38,770 --> 00:32:08,200
our demo that's a very demo so a couple

00:31:44,380 --> 00:32:16,390
things for day two operations will help

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:18,310
us write so updated directive and then

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,930
also updating indeed if I'll show you

00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,930
what it looks like here once we install

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,890
must be installed

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,860
so let's be installed open EDX right if

00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:41,559
we're doing yourself for yourself this

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:43,780
and this are coming from a pejorative

00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:58,059
project I think having the end result is

00:32:43,780 --> 00:33:01,540
our projects so see you'll see here all

00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:03,910
of the sites that and as you know here

00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,760
and will be here mostly I out that and

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:10,240
after to say this now we care mostly

00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,549
about so earlier I said that here CMS or

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,309
on back end ug runs on solar I said

00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:20,820
whenever CMS so far back as image runs

00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:29,160
on one eighty ten so looking at CMS this

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:29,160
will see here that we'll see here listen

00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:38,970
listen to so let's bring out the side

00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:38,970
exam so let's bring up the studio

00:33:50,170 --> 00:34:00,460
there we go so this is what she would

00:33:52,210 --> 00:34:04,960
look like from the base like if we log

00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:08,590
into our back in here log into our back

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:18,730
in brand-new nice because it goes does

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:23,169
go through and give you a lot of those

00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:27,179
things you can do a lot of new things

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:37,240
like questions because it also is

00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:40,620
questions definitely even in our

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:48,280
environment we do a lot of hands-on lab

00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:51,850
we do good at most the time when we're

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,040
working on manual you know most times

00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:57,659
we're working on course a new HTML

00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,659
editor who is test

00:35:04,030 --> 00:36:18,700
so explain what was happening the laws

00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,460
give you a better idea

00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:30,260
so I want to show you off from the back

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:33,860
end well you off the back end but why do

00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:36,200
in your course right it's simple as one

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,370
puny force regular simple as a new

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:44,550
course will give it to you

00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:44,550
it's a new course okay web course name

00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:57,899
from there it'd be very very

00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:59,849
straightforward to say hey section with

00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:01,709
a doctor from Derry three three three

00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:06,390
four to say hey recession with

00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:08,489
introduction once you're in new unit

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,799
Danny start editing that section of the

00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:14,659
right so let's create a unit daily star

00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,659
energy data section or so

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,060
Oh

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:30,210
there's been nothing go and see

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:33,340
their branding course there's not go see

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,600
their branding course so meal that of

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,730
course it's pretty straightforward but

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:42,490
also what's nice is that so the option

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:44,770
import option work for you so one thing

00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,750
that for us was that important word as

00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:50,940
we upgraded move so what is it for a

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:54,190
team that more forward with howdini

00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,260
one thing that kept us on our merchants

00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:59,170
so long with the one thing that might

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:10,420
this on an older version for solo is Wow

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:15,550
go to migrate there's a standard for me

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:16,900
right now right now there is no I

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,370
couldn't think of course from mood or

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:34,090
put it into but right now we're gonna do

00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:38,140
we have the trade off for upgrade when

00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:39,520
do is be good for our path nothing you

00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,240
do is be easy is the point of course

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,240
were the glyphs

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,990
export-import residents hardball over

00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,760
here preparing at the end of an exported

00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:56,310
compress it and we'll get a hardball

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,310
at these 1000 of course

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,900
then your question here new course

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:22,789
the important tools getting works

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:26,630
ports she's about import let's replace

00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:29,799
it with the current file let's replace

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,799
it with the current file

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:50,630
yeah Jesus

00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:50,630
and github so

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,850
[Music]

00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:06,710
the horse has been here so your horses

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,710
being a brand-new Porsche where to go so

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:12,270
we're 354 to import/export so but so

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,180
also it's pretty good for the

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:19,119
import/export

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:20,650
it's also so the admins portion of it so

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,779
I want to say what's the admin portion

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,700
if you have a user created portion of it

00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:27,519
so I will say what the an abortion if

00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:33,130
you have a usually a lot of the studio

00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:35,079
and edit or CMS a lot I don't see let's

00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,029
go accusing Remos rest of mugging this

00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:42,549
is your username that's where your

00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:44,589
cheerleading created that's what the god

00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:47,319
use when log in do the admin panel

00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:48,369
versus and once the AG's been long as

00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,420
you from here you can do things like

00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:54,880
users permissions community like a

00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,599
teaser site giving the permissions you

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,890
can also later different sites so you

00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,569
see here I was working through that

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:05,740
earlier Jane site configuration

00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:09,720
there's micro site we don't want that we

00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:16,510
want such integrations so he was like

00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:18,340
JSON format those two weeks format

00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,430
configure submitting to override the

00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:24,330
defaults we say or our domains demo

00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:28,420
platform font demo let me say demo

00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:30,960
spectrum on demo let's say this to

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,960
yourself

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,230
I'll save that

00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,980
what can note here is by default your

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,400
Korean new site it's not enabled by

00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,200
default

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,540
so here's my new mode of entry a new

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:53,560
site or not that one intellectually

00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:56,050
check that with it so I'll save you one

00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,869
time so by now then it should have

00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:03,040
updated if we look over here at so now

00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:05,290
that we have cut Brandt it started two

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,890
years ago mine didn't so fortunately my

00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:11,130
Steven brand is hard to team out

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,130
portions of it

00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:24,590
so let's talk about hopping to a command

00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,360
line and how we from the memory so by

00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,960
cutting and is your have a history

00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,000
solving the one joke again having

00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:39,770
installed one joke a little familiar

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:42,710
with what that looks like so we can

00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:44,570
restart the LMS at CMS separately if we

00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:49,910
made different cheese now Reese I really

00:43:44,570 --> 00:44:02,810
wanna be one of these party services

00:43:49,910 --> 00:44:04,160
well and so with by default headaches

00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:15,770
install that will install to slow

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:18,230
fashion at X n so in this and the big

00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:34,670
ones are compiled and help us big events

00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:37,520
and the big ones are VMs and all the

00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:39,740
configuration on forward that ends with

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:44,360
in almost all were there before where

00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:52,310
you store and where you store these over

00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:56,450
to the s3 and s3 how is a what you know

00:44:52,310 --> 00:45:00,119
addresses email addresses how

00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:03,630
the engineer a third party all indeed

00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:07,430
with info here so early on other

00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,430
versions of EDX it was all done in here

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:21,180
to do the LMS for the before use beyond

00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:27,000
here there's many things that are going

00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:28,740
to be again one of these days has helped

00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:41,430
me a lot is if I need to change

00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:43,109
something outlook in here se na po off

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:49,069
provider right so I was taking this and

00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:49,069
then copy pasted into my dish and then

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,150
but good portion that can be changed now

00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,650
all them can be changed from is going to

00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,450
be around a good portion can be change

00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,859
that in this type of figuration I get

00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,859
most going to be around around

00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,049
one thing could also do

00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:48,809
look at the slide here is so early on

00:47:43,849 --> 00:48:41,460
again adding to this out there the right

00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:43,279
support to concern or kind of problems

00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:48,660
that were working great

00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:55,829
or is it Russell anymore it doesn't run

00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:59,839
well is hard we tried to divert the

00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:59,839
first work we're trying to

00:49:40,450 --> 00:50:16,549
right now we have time so will were

00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:19,279
committed with adopts an Japan's see

00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:22,960
we're back is so we're working to get

00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:22,960
set up and kind of see what we can get

00:50:27,920 --> 00:51:31,610
then understand that being able to and

00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:34,230
that might be one of the best to go with

00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:40,800
I mean one of the things that brings you

00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:46,730
to 12 plus here and sledge is sort of

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:48,990
always think of 100 plus years that work

00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,820
means the height we would use your mind

00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:58,350
it is how you look at that but that

00:51:50,820 --> 00:52:02,370
being said it the baby I will say the

00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:05,190
other dogs arms are really giving me he

00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:07,650
knocks himself to reforms can be bit

00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,959
Nami has a part of the dog

00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:12,509
Orlov articles fit Nami has a locking

00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:15,479
mercenaries on do certain things but

00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:23,459
they do a lot more using very similar

00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:25,619
things how do you consistently how do

00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:31,140
you feel something like mailed or they

00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:35,339

00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:42,690
how do you how do you change how you

00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:47,940
they have a digital yet why cater to

00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:50,700
their image do apply and then like I

00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,739
said also you get to the point if you

00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,749
want creative or said also nice is that

00:52:52,739 --> 00:53:17,369
they have training on point you want

00:52:54,749 --> 00:53:22,380
creative or anywhere else the hey hey I

00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:23,999
have this question so review kind of

00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,059
what we've covered so far we went over

00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:29,759
what EDX is absolutely no interns are

00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:33,119
you know why it works and why we place

00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:36,709
the opportunity for us you can go to

00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,709
providers we often get try now

00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:51,670
we concerns

00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:23,049
both of our Kawasaki's for the next four

00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:25,089
minutes though both are on topics he

00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:30,150
said this was started by two or three

00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:30,150
universities universities

00:55:34,050 --> 00:56:52,210
they offer primary in the room during

00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:57,570
tours then that where I came into it

00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:57,570
this actually was Stefan says right here

00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:07,519
is a whole new portion that

00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,519
[Music]

00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:48,040
alright a very long period of continuity

00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:50,620
because in our environments are very

00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:54,360
very low snowflakes people even preseren

00:57:50,620 --> 00:58:00,060
requirements their own set up most of

00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:02,860
their own so if it knows how to solve

00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:05,020
and how to tackle so when the train was

00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,790
you kind of thought for specifically and

00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,890
how she tackles with taxes and waivers

00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,970
is very specific question would be

00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,970
solved through our nation

00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:34,260
no so woolens book deploy would you care

00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:34,260
for on a VM is but not a showstopper

00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:41,670
por favor

00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:45,000
I think for us just more bear to do it

00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:45,000
take advice

00:58:51,910 --> 00:59:02,460
