	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
Curious about real home automation? Tired of having to interface with dozens of apps to control your home, why not use a single one? Want to mix and match hardware, use something with local control, and open source? How about building your own sensors for cheap, no soldering or coding? Then this talk is for you.  **Warning automation can be addictive**

thing Automation you know like like nest

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:11,040
or lifx or any of these other home

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,099
automation brands that are all dependent

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,389
on open opening their app to do

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,580
something I don't consider that

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,760
automation because it's not because you

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,380
as a human are telling it what to do and

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,180
so I'm going to talk about how you can

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,609
actually build real automation flows

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,980
within home assistant and node-red to go

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,250
way beyond what you could ever do with

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,340
some of these proprietary solutions so

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,120
home assistant it is Apache 2.0 license

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,840
so again a real open-source license it

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,160
is real automation not as some stupid

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,789
app that you have to tell it do

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,000
everything it prioritizes local control

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,050
and privacy so it always when it adds a

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,739
new feature it is always keeping that in

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,559
mind of how meant how can this be local

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,030
and local control so not dependent on

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:12,360
the cloud or dependent on someone else's

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,060
server it keeps all data local thereby

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,939
keeping private and as of this month

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,759
there was over 1,400 components

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:25,680
supported today so one of the big things

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,820
that once you start going down the road

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,549
of actually doing home automation is you

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,619
get a detect when your home because you

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,119
want certain things to happen when your

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:43,170
home versus when you're not home and

00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:45,360
there's a couple different ways of what

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,060
type of area do you want do you want

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,790
when you're near home when you're at

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,070
home or when you at the room level or

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,820
even down to the part of the room level

00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:02,159
so on the GPS this could be your phone

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,799
there's a home assistant app on that you

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,429
can install an Android or iOS that will

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,730
report via via report over

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,560
mqtt back to your controller where your

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,510
GPS location is and you

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,340
can draw a map within home assistant

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:26,220
saying if I enter this circle do XYZ

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:28,530
your car there are Tesla has an API that

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,440
you can basically gain the location of

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:37,080
your Tesla based by doing an API call to

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,120
Tesla's servers and so you can thereby

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,400
tell where at least your car is and

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,130
presumably where you are based on the

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,950
location of your car BMW I think this

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,170
also has the same thing the on your car

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:57,540
part is very dependent on which

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:59,819
manufacturer you have so it is invader

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:08,549
with it is supposed to be released in

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:11,160
the next month or so or less but

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,170
potentially you know maybe you don't

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,660
want it draining on the battery it may

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,250
be it may not check in as fast so maybe

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,000
you only have it on a 30 minute pole

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,670
cycle or you just don't want to allow

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,100
outside access because for the Android

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,950
app to work you got to either use Nava

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,920
Casas which I'll get to that or you have

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,290
to open up the firewall rules at your

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,549
house to allow the cell phone app to

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,569
communicate directly with your home

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:42,060
install so then there's present

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,870
detection whether you're at home so

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:49,049
there it is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi you can

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,260
also use motion sensors on the Wi-Fi if

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,170
you use like the unify system it can can

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,019
home assistant can connect to the API

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,329
unifies API and say alright this device

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,630
so my cell phone is connected to the

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,120
wireless so he's probably at home and

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,709
the Bluetooth it can use passive

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,900
Bluetooth detection like a like a

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,680
Raspberry Pi with a Bluetooth stick so

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,650
he can basically say if I detect there's

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,430
Bluetooth MAC address just beginning em

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,740
nearby then his phone's probably home

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,000
room level you can do cameras so you can

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,490
do

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,060
object recognition using the cameras so

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,440
it'd be like if you see me using face

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,490
box so you can actually do facial

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,760
recognition you say if I'm in this room

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,760
do XYZ there's motion detection and if

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,930
you use Bluetooth le with Bluetooth le

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:53,420
beacons you can actually get down to you

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:58,910
know sub-meter sub yard resolution on

00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:01,410
the detecting within the room level so

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,680
hardware this is a big one in Houma and

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:06,210
home automation is who do you go with do

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,600
you go with a big name like Google Nest

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,280
who Hugh or Amazon based on their

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,250
current track record and what they've

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,120
done in the past I would say hell no

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:22,010
they typically are limited api's if any

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,560
or if you have nest products they

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,860
discontinue the API and shut down public

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,650
access to the API and only allow Google

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,020
products to act access said said API so

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,150
if you bought a nest device like I have

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,040
they will disappear out of home

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,580
assistant because Google decided to

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,440
discontinue the API what is even better

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,830
than these big brands and I'll list some

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,919
of them there's the wide light about

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:53,250
light bulbs these are generally devices

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,060
that are Wi-Fi so you don't have to deal

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,620
with ZigBee or z-wave there's no bridge

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,370
required they connect directly to your

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,430
Wi-Fi they have local access so they

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,850
have some type of local API on them so

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:14,000
they don't require cloud connection the

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:17,090
I have I personally have the tp-link

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,979
switches and they work really great

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,380
there's you don't have to you don't have

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,630
to fool with any authentication they

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,780
just come up on your network and you put

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,000
in an IP address of the device of the

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,580
switch or light bulb or whatever in-home

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,740
assistant and it will and it will be

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,800
able to turn it on or off the the the

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,699
lifx brand of light bulbs the unify

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,440
cameras and api's or the cameras and aps

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:50,039
these again have local control if you're

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,930
running the local server so it you can

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,560
pull up the cameras within home

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,629
assistant you can use the APS for

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,509
present detection so when someone is

00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,520
home again the Shelli devices are

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,479
actually really cool and they just came

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,099
out on the market about a year ago but

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:11,190
from my understanding the company get

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,860
fed up with having the founder get fed

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:18,479
up with having to flash other people's

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,039
hardware to gain local control and he

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,199
wanted a device that just works out of

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,080
the box so Shelley has produced a wide

00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,440
range of devices everything from smoke

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,219
detectors to LED strip controllers

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,180
that's what the RGB is humidity sensors

00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:38,990
plugs outlets and relays and the Shelley

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,900
device is out of the box support in qtt

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,430
and so all you have to do is put in the

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,259
mqtt server that you run on your network

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,750
into the interface on the Shelley device

00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,690
and it immediately starts working

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,479
there's no flashing of the hardware

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:58,110
there's no opening it up and generally

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:03,090
they are based on the 80 to 66 arduino

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:06,930
chip and then Roku devices with when you

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:09,210
add a Roku device into home assistant

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,699
you can tell when it's playing something

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:16,590
you can control it remotely because Roku

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:18,240
has a it listens on an a socket on the

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,270
local device and if you say it you can

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:26,360
send it commands to up arrow down arrow

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:30,300
open Netflix close Netflix open YouTube

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,190
and so once you can get that level of

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,500
control within a device you can now

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,010
start automating it and I'll get to some

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,459
examples later hardware part two this is

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,029
where I named in shame iris by Lowe's it

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:47,720
was a I believe a easy waiver ZigBee

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,529
based system and they had a central hub

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,800
beginning of this year they announced

00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,970
that they were no longer sawing the

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,100
devices

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,940
and the cloud controller is being shut

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,580
down and so if you have the devices they

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,200
will literally stop all functionality

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,810
this year they and the announcement they

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,510
promised to make it open source I don't

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:17,640
know if that actually come to fruition

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:19,410
and they they promised to do some type

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,110
of rebate program I don't know if that

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,950
actually came to fruition so this is one

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:29,370
example of a cloud a cloud-based system

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,110
failing you because the host company

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,920
behind it decided to shut it down

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:39,630
there's a harmony devices Logitech had

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,730
had / has because they keep going back

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,210
and forth on this one but basically some

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,580
of their devices would listen on the

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,890
local interface and you would a you were

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,710
allowed to send it commands over the

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:56,940
interface they then pushed an update

00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:00,000
down to the devices that improved

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,750
security by turning off this local

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,250
access and they they had to walk it back

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,930
at one point you had to install a beta

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,970
firmware but if you installed the beta

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,070
firmware it would bring the device out

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:18,000
of compliance C so they were no longer

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,460
on or warranty there's this is another

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,390
example of a brand that needs to be

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:27,270
named and shamed on their device then

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:30,140
then there's the IKEA devices they are a

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:33,270
ZigBee based hub and bridge system so

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,420
they sell a lot of inexpensive like door

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:40,170
sensors window sensors motion sensors

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:44,210
things like that even though home

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:49,680
assistant doesn't use an official API

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:53,670
IKEA is a software arm is aware of the

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,030
use that home assistant is using this

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,700
API and they made a they were making a

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,640
chain a breaking IKEA was making a

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,350
breaking change to this API and they

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,480
actually gave home assistants the heads

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,850
up going we're making this change

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,740
here's what you need to do to work on

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,320
the new API so even though it's not an

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,170
official the home assistant is not using

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,150
an official API there is that

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,010
cooperation between the vendor and home

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,380
assistant there's weather underground

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,450
weather underground used to have a

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,540
public API that you could pull weather

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,600
information including if you had a if

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,060
you had your own local hardware that was

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,760
using that was reporting up to Weather

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,620
Underground after they closed the public

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,710
API you can no longer get the data of

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,200
your own device from Weather Underground

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,410
there by another failing of the cloud

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,870
and the devices that depend on cloud

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,360
connectivity and then there's nest I

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,310
already mentioned earlier about them

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:58,620
closing their API to public access

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,050
believe it goes into effect in August so

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,620
it's yeah yeah one more example of a big

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:08,400
company failing the hobbyist and DIY

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,820
community with wanting local control not

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,010
wanting everything to be cloud based

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,790
they're building your own devices

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:21,240
right here I have a it's a multi sensor

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,610
so it does temperature humidity it does

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,330
a motion sensor it's got a light sensor

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:30,860
and an infinite colored LED cost 30

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,110
bucks no soldering no coding required

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:37,470
and then you can put this in about

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,770
whatever case you want well I've heard

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,810
of people using do you know those boxes

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,530
that you put your soap in when you're

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,810
traveling you know it's like a $2.00 box

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:53,010
put this in it all you have to do is

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:55,530
stick it in there and then hot glue the

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,570
sensors it doesn't have to be fancy I

00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,210
mean now if you if you have access to a

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:04,020
3d printer then you can absolutely make

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:09,150
you a nice case and in this github link

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:13,170
he does publish 3d drawings so you can

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:16,490
print your own case for this and I

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,490
actually will show you the sensor

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:33,209
so here's home assistant I've moved all

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,810
of my other objects god that resolution

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:40,440
sucks I moved all my other objects out

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,990
so it's just this and you can manually

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,360
turn it and you can see that the LED

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:51,180
just lit up you can change its color to

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:55,050
basically anything in the rainbow and it

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,660
will change it in real time you wouldn't

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,399
really use this interface for your

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,040
day-to-day activities of interfacing

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,040
with this what you could users do is for

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,200
your testing and development of I want

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,230
this to be this color you can select it

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,290
off the color wheel and find out that

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,520
what it's hex code is and use that hex

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:20,160
code in your automation to program that

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,560
so you know you can turn you can have it

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,420
set so that when it flashes red it means

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,660
this when it flashes blue it means this

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,209
when it flashes green it means this you

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:35,730
can see it's got a motion sensor right

00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:38,070
here see how it detected motion so it's

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:41,279
got a light sensor so you can to tell

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,050
whether the let's say you want to have

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,670
program that when it's dark you have

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,170
lights automatically come on but when

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,880
the Sun comes up you want the lights to

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,839
go off you can use this little light

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,579
sensor and then you also get your

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,399
temperature humidity it's 70 degrees

00:14:53,579 --> 00:15:03,649
it's 70% humidity it's a little muggy in

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:03,649
here and so there is

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,690
so there's installing home assistant

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,290
there's something called haseo

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,710
which is a easy way to set up home

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:23,680
assistant on any device because it

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:26,170
bundles the operating system docker and

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,870
all the containers needed to get home

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:33,940
assistant up and running with virtually

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:45,610
no install required yes oh it's too

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:47,710
bright so so haseo is about the easiest

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,530
way to get started they produce

00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:55,420
Raspberry Pi images and they also

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:58,660
produce one line installers for a if you

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:02,560
already have an existing debian or a

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,500
bone to type device it's a one-to-one

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,870
liner install which will install docker

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,890
it will and saw all the dependencies it

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,970
will download the haas io can containers

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,670
start it all up and configure everything

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,070
with one line you can if you already

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,280
have an existing like kubernetes cluster

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,780
or docker swarm you can throw you can

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,140
throw home assistant and its

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,370
dependencies within it python virtual

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,950
environments i don't know much about

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:33,550
that but that is one of the install

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:37,210
options there's also free NASA and

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:39,220
Synology have one-click installers so

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,710
you can do it from within those you are

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,900
those masks you is it's a one-click

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,780
install for on wall insistence I will

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:52,270
warn you the add-ons can be quite

00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:55,420
addicting and because there are a ton of

00:16:52,270 --> 00:17:00,730
add-ons here or what comes in the

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:03,010
official and community things so there's

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,610
everything from you know you can do a

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:12,400
DHCP DNS Duck DNS you can put you can do

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:15,850
get on it let's let's encrypt you can do

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,650
local AI or not local AI sorry local

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:21,070
voice control so if you want to build

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,470
your own Alexa device but not use the

00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:26,529
Amazon product that's always listening

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:29,590
you can build your own using this and

00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:33,220
all of these add-ons get installed in a

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:35,769
separate docker container so that it

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,750
doesn't cause problems or doesn't

00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:40,960
conflict with homelessness it makes it

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,019
for a pretty stable environment and you

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,360
can just see there's a ton of options

00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:50,259
including node-red which is what I use

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:54,370
and I use pretty extent extensively and

00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:56,679
there's like zero t1 and I think there

00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,919
was also the wire guard is in here too

00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,240
so it in Plex and it makes ease makes

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,409
installing these add-ons

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,799
very easy the downside with ions is they

00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:12,580
can really tax or Texas system so ia

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,220
just a bare-bones home assistant without

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,350
any add-ons or a few add-ons can run on

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,610
a Raspberry Pi and that's where it got

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:24,340
its genesis is you would download the SD

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,340
card image you throw it on a PI and it

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,350
would get started but as you start

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,350
adding more and more add-ons they become

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,659
more and more CPU dependent and the

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,779
biggest where the PI's have some

00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:40,830
reliability is on the SD card almost

00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:44,590
invariably within a year you will burn a

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:47,620
SD card so I generally recommend you can

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:50,830
try it out on up high if you love it

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,350
move it over to something with real

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,350
storage like it could be an old laptop

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,350
it can be an old desktop it could be a

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:02,409
nuke those are real popular and just

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:07,779
something with a real storage not an SD

00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:10,720
card so here's some examples of what you

00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:13,389
can do with real home automation there's

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:19,120
the fire service and Australia will

00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:21,669
produce polygons on a KMZ which can be

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,399
imported into Google Earth but these

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,909
polygons will content will be areas

00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:31,090
where a wildfire is in danger of burning

00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:32,799
up you know like like there's a wildfire

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,730
are already going and these are the

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,250
areas that it will be next well you can

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,100
how home assistant because consume these

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,070
polygons and when your address is within

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,679
the polygon or near the polygon you can

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,600
then trigger actions and these actions

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,669
could be you know a turn on your

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,370
sprinkler system outside because just

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,220
just wetting the ground can keep the

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,770
fire from creeping up on the dead grass

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,990
that you have outside it can you can

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:04,240
tell if you have motorized shutters it

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,370
will lower the shutters it will turn on

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,049
the sprinklers on the roof so that the

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,350
embers that land on the roof don't

00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,700
actually burn up and it can send your

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,500
notification that this is all happening

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,900
and and let's say you have a gasoline

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,190
pump that pumps off your pool water to

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,890
feed all these sprinklers you can turn

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:27,100
that on automatically this is all

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:30,210
without any human intervention entirely

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,710
automatic and in other words home fires

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,910
home fires at night when people are

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,610
sleeping or particularly dangerous

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,919
because a you don't know about it and be

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,200
by the time you know about it the house

00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,600
is heavily smoked and all your lights

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,910
off so you can't see anything well if

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
the let's say the smoke detector

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,760
detected a fire it would first turn on

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,500
every light in the house after after it

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,450
starts siren it would turn on every

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,160
light in the house and outside so that

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,830
everything is lit up so it makes it

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,390
easier to get out it well you could tell

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,669
it to turn off the air-conditioning so

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,110
you're not spreading smoke around the

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:08,290
entire house so you try to keep it

00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,690
contained if you put a solenoid on your

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,700
gas line you can tell the system to turn

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,440
off your gas service to the house so

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,040
that there's not a risk of an explosion

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,280
or the gas service feeding the fire more

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,750
intently I say you have a gate at the

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,059
end of your driveway you can tell the

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,100
home is home assistant to open that gate

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,169
so that when the fire trucks come they

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,940
can they don't have to wait for you to

00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,580
go open the gate and this and all this

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,679
can be entirely automatic and another

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,169
one which might seem small is stop the

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,210
stopping and starting your Roomba let's

00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:44,500
say you have an Roomba or some other

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,299
Wi-Fi connected automated vacuum but

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,559
they're real noisy so you don't want you

00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,480
don't want it running that night you

00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,720
don't want it you also don't want it run

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,940
when you are at home and so you can have

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,010
it detect using the like the Wi-Fi is

00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,760
okay you know me and my wife are gone

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,500
right now I'm gonna turn off the motion

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,679
sensors for the security system so that

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,230
Roomba doesn't activate it it you can

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,630
then turn on the Roomba to let it start

00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:14,049
working but I know someone someone came

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,860
home so you tell the Roomba all right go

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:19,029
away stop turn off go away go back in

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,769
another one is going to bed you know

00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,840
when you go to bed there's a lot of

00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,570
things that you do you know whether it's

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,019
closing blinds whether it's locking the

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,419
doors turning lights off maybe setting

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:34,450
the coffeepot you know setting your own

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:35,769
alarm you can basically tell the home

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,529
automation all right it's time to go to

00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:41,889
bed and then it does all these actions

00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:44,950
for you and the other ones getting up in

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:47,740
the morning it interfaces with Waze or

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,200
Google Maps so it can gain an estimate

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,330
on your travel time and so if there's a

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,830
really bad accident on like the

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,690
interstate and it's gonna add 30 minutes

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,029
to your commute well you can tell home

00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:01,330
assistant all right set my alarm 30

00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:03,789
minutes earlier so that and turn the

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,620
coffeepot on thirty minutes earlier so

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,029
that and it will get you up thirty

00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,590
minutes earlier so that you can get out

00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:11,110
the door and still make it to work in

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,789
time so once you can start interfacing

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,970
with all these different components you

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:26,350
can you can start growing what the

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:29,320
problems you could solve with oh yeah

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:33,240
there's less light so those are the some

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,399
examples of what real automation is not

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,019
pulling out your app and telling it to

00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,019
do something thank you

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,679
[Applause]

00:23:50,430 --> 00:24:03,370
yes less likely because typically if you

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,190
have a FreeNAS box

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,740
it's an x86 box with real RAM and real

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,270
storage so that's typically not a

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,910
problem it also depends on what your

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,230
plugins are if your plugins are very

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,690
light it's fine

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,340
if you're wanting to do face box or

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,880
tensorflow which is doing image

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:25,240
recognition then yes that can be a lot

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,070
more intense on the CPU and memory so it

00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:37,150
really depends on what plugins you want

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:46,540
what problems you trying to solve yes no

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:47,680
I'm not familiar with that if it's open

00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,340
source and it's probably already

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,340
integrated

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,049
so here's yeah here's the voice

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,600
integrations at a support yeah I'm craft

00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:21,990
is supported and so as you can see

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,309
there's a there's a very healthy list of

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,580
automations that you can that you can do

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:30,610
one of the automations is if you're on

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,749
if you are in a data let's say you have

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,090
a limitation on how much you can

00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:38,619
download one of the one of the plugins

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,700
can be that your isp produces an api

00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,070
that tells you how much you've

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,340
downloaded you consume that api and when

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:56,590
you're getting near your limit you tell

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:58,629
transmission to stop downloading yeah

00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:02,379
i'm not i've not played with those

00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:05,049
systems i believe its face box is one of

00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:09,850
the most common ones and i believe it

00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:14,320
can consume a RSTP stream that those are

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:19,440
the SE there's face box there there's

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,440
tensorflow there's some amazon there's

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:28,029
cloud systems and those are just

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,159
dependent on what those accept and some

00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:33,789
of these might just be that on site it

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:40,619
consumes a jpeg and sent that jpeg up to

00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:40,619
Microsoft for processing yes

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:55,480
they do have a backup and restore

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:58,900
functionality I did it about six months

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,300
ago when it was a much earlier version

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,810
and it broke mine and I didn't I ended

00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:08,740
up having to restart yeah well I will

00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:10,840
say there's Paulus who is the main

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,540
developer he was actually hired by

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,820
ubiquity for about a year and a half and

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,400
he paid his salary so that he could work

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,700
full-time on home assistant and in the

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,370
past year the it has been almost a night

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,000
and day with the features the stability

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:30,130
in the progress of the code he is no

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,490
longer with you BIC would he is now with

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:38,710
a company called Nava casa na Picasa is

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:41,260
a cloud proxy and the ter caretaker of

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,130
home assistant so what the Nava Casa

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:48,460
cloud allows you to do is it will act as

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,350
a proxy but it due to the end-to-end

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,200
encryption it can't see any the traffic

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,330
but using their Nava Casa cloud you do

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,680
not have to open up ports in your

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,520
firewall you don't have to deal with

00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:03,040
certificates or port forwarding and it's

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,830
a you know check box type configuration

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,450
on your local homeless system and due to

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,320
the Indian encryption they can't

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,580
actually peer into the traffic and I

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,780
think I think it's like five bucks a

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,780
month so it's not bad yeah Jim

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:27,730
yep it's it is a one-by-one liner

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,680
install on those and it will set up the

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,330
doctor environment and download all the

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:36,790
containers using the haseo

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,500
system if you don't want to deal with

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,350
docker then you can do it as a Python

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,930
virtual environment but the vast

00:28:41,350 --> 00:29:10,390
majority of people use has i/o because

00:28:43,930 --> 00:29:13,750
it's just so easy and and and and that's

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,960
what I run I run it as a VM I have a

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:21,510
bare-bones boom to VM that it runs

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:26,980
within and if you attended my tiny home

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:30,280
talk we are planning on building a I

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,160
call it the full-size home the end of

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,440
this year or early next year and one of

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,950
the things I plan on doing is running

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,990
Ethernet every door running and every

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:43,660
window I'm going to put door sensors on

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,100
every door and on the windows so that I

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,380
can tell when they're up and down I'm

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,660
also good gonna do roller blinds

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,720
automatic roller blinds on all the

00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,510
windows every room will have temperature

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,470
and humidity using one of these motion

00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:03,790
using one of these and even the RGB LED

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:06,160
so that I can help basically use it as a

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:11,670
communication method for the system

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,670
communicate with me yes

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:26,090
yep so a lot of it depends on what you

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:29,719
want to use so you can use cameras or

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:33,440
you can use Bluetooth or there's some a

00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:35,450
few other techniques but it it's really

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,369
like for Bluetooth to work you've got to

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,629
have your phone on you so it's not going

00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:43,039
to text you if you don't have your phone

00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:46,879
now they do have bluetooth LE beacons

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,409
that are about yay big that I've heard

00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:50,599
people clipping them to their pets

00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:53,059
collars so they know where their pet is

00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,369
within the house so that the pet doesn't

00:30:53,059 --> 00:31:06,320
trigger the motion sensors on the alarm

00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:09,200
system so you can use Bluetooth le

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,469
beacons which have a very limited range

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,499
in your phone the your phone would

00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:18,229
detect the Bluetooth beacon and say I am

00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:20,330
near this beacon and they were Tahoma

00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:31,639
system that and and you have assigned

00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:35,929
that beacon to a room there is there is

00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:39,649
a system that uses bluetooth and Wi-Fi

00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:41,509
to help triangulate I've not looked too

00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:44,179
much into it

00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:48,289
but there is a way of doing that but

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:51,909
it's it's not super accurate it's the

00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:56,089
the most accurate way is to go with a

00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:59,779
motion detection Bluetooth le or some

00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:03,349
cameras and there's also you can enable

00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:06,289
bei something bei on sensors but

00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:09,049
basically you it determines the

00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:12,349
probability that something is true so

00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:15,349
you can connect a bluetooth sensor the

00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:17,269
Wi-Fi sensor and a motion sensor all

00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:20,179
together and going if all of these

00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,979
sensors agree that I'm in a room the

00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,239
odds is probably pretty close to a

00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:25,190
hundred percent that I'm in that room

00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:25,670
and you can put a threshold going all

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,310
right if the

00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,590
thresholds over 80% then do this

00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:33,290
automation but if that if the threshold

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,450
is under 80% then there's not enough

00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,910
agreement or enough confidence that I'm

00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:41,360
in this that I'm in this room and and

00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:43,340
you can use those sensors to do like it

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,110
if you want to determine how you know

00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,080
whether you're cooking or not it'd be

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:50,540
like you you can detect it the hood fan

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,250
is on you can detect if there's been a

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,210
large spike in your power draw because

00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,880
of your electric oven

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,290
you're gonna TechEd whether the light in

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,820
the kitchen is on and if all three

00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,910
conditions are true you probably are

00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:07,190
cooking and so you you can use multiple

00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:17,120
sensors to come to a conclusion about

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:19,310
something there they range i I'm not

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,250
personally looked into them but I

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,380
believe they're sub-20 and they're very

00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:33,850
low power so they they get a decent

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:33,850
lifetime yeah yeah ah okay

00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,070
yeah I mean I mean the the the there's

00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,770
people that have installed a pressure

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,260
sensor between the boxspring and the

00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,820
mattress and if there's pressure there

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,760
then there's probably someone in the bed

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,680
so then then you can rent a nomination

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,300
if all right if I'm selling the bed and

00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,400
the alarm is going off keep the alarm

00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,750
going and disable the snooze button

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:34,540
because I probably need to get my ass

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:38,280
out of bed the oldest payer I would take

00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:41,110
a look at one of these on this screen

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,510
with face box probably being the one I'd

00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:46,630
start with because basically ease is

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:48,900
this a human great there's a human in

00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,900
the world

00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:30,530
yeah there's a lot of good examples and

00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,450
and the longer these integrations have

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,830
been alive the better the online

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:39,530
examples and documentation and there's a

00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:42,290
there's a wrath of home assistant config

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:45,530
files on github because a lot of people

00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:50,060
will publish their entire configuration

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,859
online because it has the capability of

00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:54,770
putting all your secrets in a separate

00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:57,730
file and so you can just reference you

00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:00,320
know like dusts or asterisk secret and

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,410
reference it in another document so that

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,740
you can openly publish your entire

00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,740
configuration

00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,570
[Laughter]

00:36:38,089 --> 00:37:19,219
so yeah yeah

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:44,350
yeah but yeah there are a ton of

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,940
integrations and you know I would

00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,280
recommend before you buying a device

00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,500
come on here and see you know see if

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,310
it's integrated already out of the gate

00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,990
and odds are it probably is you know the

00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:05,410
one of one of the ones I'm using for my

00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:07,900
energy is it I don't see it's programmed

00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,880
somewhere else um but it's open energy

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,170
monitoring it's a company out of the UK

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,300
that has an open API or here you can

00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,720
actually get your Duke bill so if you're

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,480
in Duke territory like I am you can

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,160
access their API see just you just use

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,640
your Duke username and password and it

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,970
will go out there and fetch your

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:34,390
electric and gas meter usage and so you

00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,620
could be like you know of power power

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,390
users - hi this month

00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:44,620
honey I'm turning there I'm going to

00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:47,110
turn the AC off for you this like in the

00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:50,650
case of like Duke it would be dependent

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:53,970
on what level of information that they

00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,560
publish to the API and it looks like

00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:59,500
yesterday's information is not published

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:05,620
until mid-morning and but some of these

00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:07,690
others like what I'm using and there was

00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:11,010
another one I saw that like the cents

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:14,050
are real time because they actually sit

00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:17,530
they use CT clamps on your power

00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:19,870
conductors so they can do real-time yeah

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,040
they they measure the voltage and

00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,760
amperage and they calculate how many

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,640
watch you're using in real time so I can

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,130
tell based on the power spikes when the

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,360
oven is on when the dryer is on when air

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,980
conditioning comes on when the

00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,330
refrigerator comes on because there's

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,330
every one of them spikes

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
yes

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:55,299
so he actually has an entire video on

00:39:51,289 --> 00:40:00,470
building this sensor don't use his code

00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:04,099
he talks about doing this all and using

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:11,240
the Arduino KDE or IDE don't do that

00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:13,190
what you want to use is ESP home ESP

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,839
home directly integrates with home

00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:19,670
assistance and it allows you to here's

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,460
your entire configuration for this

00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,349
device this is there's no code you just

00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,619
you just drop this in change a couple

00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:33,099
values based on names and I can actually

00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:35,809
show you what it looks like in home Lib

00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:37,160
so here here the devices and here's

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:41,210
actually the actual speaker lights and

00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:44,569
the demo it this system allows you to

00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:49,400
remotely push new firmware to these ESP

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:53,089
devices there's no custom there's no

00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,680
custom coding and even using these this

00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:58,990
particular example there's not even any

00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:02,650
soldering because I just hate soldering

00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,650
and yes

00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:50,920
yes so there's one system that I saw a

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:55,000
demo from CES and they use cameras but

00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:58,030
the system itself will convert the human

00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,520
form into stick figure and or we will

00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,590
save the stick figure so so it's not an

00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,780
ax it's not the violation of privacy

00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:08,260
that having cameras inside would be and

00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:11,920
it has algorithms such that it detects

00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:14,800
sudden Falls or lying down on the floor

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,220
which would be unnatural and then can

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,320
send alerts and then if you have a

00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,850
caretaker that it could it would send

00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,250
them the video of the stick figure so

00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:26,230
you can see the stick figure walking

00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,420
trip fall and they're still laying on

00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,180
the ground at which point you then you

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,980
can then go go help but there there are

00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,710
a lot of cool technologies that are

00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:39,070
coming out and hopefully they get the

00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:47,100
message that open api's local control

00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:47,100
and privacy are important anything else

00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:55,940
well thank you for coming to my talk

00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:55,940
