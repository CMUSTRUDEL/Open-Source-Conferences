	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
It's been 22 years since The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Where we've been might tell us  something about where we're going. Today's challenges include the ephemeralization of computers, the decline of C,  open hardware, and increasingly dangerous information monopolies. What's a hacker to do?

hello I will read it

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:16,540
future I'm watching something or see

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:20,070
channel so you can put stuff all right

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,070
I'll read the mail

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,599
[Music]

00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,110
[Music]

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,790
[Music]

00:04:47,370 --> 00:05:15,970
seven five one three five two seven five

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:27,419
nine thirty one but he's again will draw

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:32,610
again all right not two seven four five

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,610
seven nine looks like James

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:54,040
[Music]

00:05:45,610 --> 00:06:08,390
last one from this drug have to 7508 to

00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:17,990
James Baker let's have some buzz have

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:22,150
Foucault's draw the poco winner takes

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,150
more than 20 terabyte to get into Mordor

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,650
one does not simply DMA into Mordor

00:06:34,180 --> 00:07:23,210
Jeremy row so else I'll be really quick

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,160
and save the full remarks for closing

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,350
remarks but if you want a t-shirt we

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,570
will sell you some with the number of

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,190
the woman's t-shirt this year crushed us

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,190
we're gonna do a second run in mail

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,280
tomorrow

00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:59,360
we're running without lag all right it

00:08:51,470 --> 00:09:01,250
feels like I'm talking to Mars that's

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,870
it's really bad having to wait three

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,870
seconds for my laughs Lawrence to take

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:15,589
[Music]

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:31,970
ok camera just got knocked again I'm

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:42,010
looking at the ceiling well that was

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:47,320
three seconds ago Wow

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,320
[Music]

00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:53,089
all right well 21 years ago I wrote the

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,149
original Cathedral in the bizarre

00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:56,790
manifesto and the first thing I want to

00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,560
point out

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,560
we've won of awful lot of victories

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,290
since then the most widely deployed

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,170
operating system in the world is open

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:11,390
sourced ok so it runs on smartphones

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,390
instead of PCs but it's still victory

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:24,630
I'm not hearing any sound I am still not

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:33,630
hearing any sound I am Not sure this is

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:37,670
working I'm guilty of that yes or I

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,670
muted you to get rid of the echo effects

00:10:37,730 --> 00:11:02,820
okay yeah and now you know what the

00:10:51,240 --> 00:11:04,290
three-second that goes like well these

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,120
are this is absolutely the most

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,090
difficult set of conditions I've ever

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,490
given a talk under not excluding the

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:15,390
time I did it on a boat in the middle of

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:18,270
the Baltic Sea alright well let me start

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,570
over again we've won a lot of victories

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:25,020
in the last 21 years but one of the

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,150
things about engineering is when you

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,890
solve a set of problems your reward is

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:33,690
you get to deal with the problems that

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:36,780
come with your solutions and I am

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,160
sitting before you as an exemplar of one

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,680
of the problems that come with our

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,320
solutions now that the world is

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,120
dependent on Internet infrastructure and

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,280
on open source software the software

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,980
that you guys write and that I write

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,020
there are certain problems that come

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,240
with that dependence and one of them is

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:59,010
a phenomenon I'm going to label the

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:03,200
load-bearing internet person now we'll

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,200
wait for the audio to catch up

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,410
um I think I'd rather deal with the echo

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:36,210
hello camera is moving again I have you

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:37,540
unmuted again all right very good okay

00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:53,670
Wow

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:57,010
I'm still talking tomorrow we're zooming

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,050
so we have a set of problems today that

00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,970
have to do with the solutions that we've

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,950
come up with over the last 20 years and

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,040
that is that we now have load-bearing

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,840
internet people we have people that the

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Internet depends on to maintain critical

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:29,290
infrastructure software there are some

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,330
others that good name these are people

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:37,300
who are maintaining critical bits of

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:41,290
infrastructure and things like DNS time

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:44,110
service the application that passes

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,800
location information from the GPS sensor

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:50,230
on your phone to the maps and other

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,060
location-aware applications in it these

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,520
are things these pieces of instruction

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,010
infrastructure are things that have in

00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,460
common the problem that it's difficult

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,950
to monetize them that means there is no

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,290
revenue stream there is no profit motive

00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,230
and there is no money going to the

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,990
people who are maintaining the software

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,710
which is fine as long as we're all young

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,300
and invincible and in perfect health and

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:19,220
don't need to eat much he

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,610
any of those preconditions stop being

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,500
case we have a problem and a lot of the

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,170
load-bearing internet people nowadays

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,780
are starting to get into their 50s and

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:35,600
60s this brings up two problems one is

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:38,030
how do we plan for succession what

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,540
happens when the load has to pass and

00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:43,480
the other question is what are you what

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,840
are we going to do with our workhorses

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,100
send them to the glue factory well I'm

00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,160
on the solution to all these problems

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,010
today but there's one that we've got to

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,010
solve if we want our internet to keep

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,710
working and that is that the people who

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,860
work on this these Commons pieces of

00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,530
infrastructure time service DNS and so

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,390
forth somehow they got to get money to

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:14,030
pay bills or there's gonna be breakage

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,040
in fact arguably we've already had some

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,980
cases of this we had shell shock and a

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,630
bunch of other security bugs that were

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,190
due to the fact that those projects were

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,810
being done by volunteers who were

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,460
chronically underfunded I've been

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,060
actually worrying out this problem for

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,010
quite a while and I made a stab at

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,190
solving it institutionally by trying to

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,580
found the the internet civil engineering

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:43,640
and Institute but that shutdown last

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,670
month it turns out that recruiting

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:50,020
people who are able and competent to run

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,310
an organization like that is not so easy

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,090
so now we need to try something

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,950
different

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,520
and I've been noodling on the problem

00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:03,260
and I think I know what it is I want to

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:06,980
propose that we need a new custom and

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,420
the custom is this some of you might

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,600
remember an old religious practice

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,490
called tithing where you took a small

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,830
portion of your income then you send it

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,390
to worthy causes and historically you

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,620
did it through a church but we don't

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,830
need to do that anymore we've got things

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:26,410
like patreon and subscribe store so

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,410
let's let the audio catch up

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:51,499
Wow I don't even know if anybody's heard

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:58,910
my saying this is pretty awful yes oh I

00:16:51,499 --> 00:17:02,119
can actually see the laughing oh dear

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,270
okay so no audience sound wonderful

00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:07,490
wonderful wonderful you know there's a

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:18,980
reason I gave up being mr. famous guy

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:21,339
back in 2004 all right that sounds like

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,339
a good idea

00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:25,429
all right so speaking of infrastructure

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:30,919
lash Ups

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:32,840
yeah like this okay so centralized waves

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:35,600
of solving that problem have been tried

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,279
and well I tried it but failed so I'm

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,620
going to propose a decentralized ones

00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,529
the custom we all need to adopt if we

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,850
want to have a healthy internet if you

00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,559
have a regular job

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,380
and you have an income and you have an

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:52,520
employer here's what you need to be

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,100
doing look around you in find ones

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,039
load-bearing internet people people like

00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,320
Oh makes an example that's not me how

00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,940
many of them you know who Dave taht is

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,639
I'm sorry I guess you can't answer that

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,669
because I can't hear you

00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:10,909
Dave Todd is a friend of mine who has

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:13,850
done massive service to the net in the

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:15,740
form of fixing the buffer blood problem

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,450
some of y'all probably know about the

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,360
buffer blood problem

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,730
it's the reason the internet video used

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,659
to suck much worse than it did and than

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,029
it does now any more recently he's fixed

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:33,429
some massive latency problems in Wi-Fi

00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:35,690
and right now he's fighting to keep

00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,779
routers from getting screwed up by a

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,960
priority scheme that is well let's just

00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:46,299
say biased and some interesting

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:50,200
this is a guy who has given more than a

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:53,649
decade to trying to keep the Internet in

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,080
good shape and not only has it been a

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,610
mostly thankless job where he's tried to

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,759
tried to Scrabble for pennies while

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,500
people were making literally hundreds of

00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,590
millions of dollars on the results of

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,919
the work that he did it's it's broken

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,529
his health he's blind in one eye and has

00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,299
has chronic health problems that I think

00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:19,059
come from the fact that he spent years

00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:21,720
living like a nomad and a mouth it

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:24,039
really made me sad to watch and in fact

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,690
watching Dave Todd's experience of

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,110
burning himself out like that was the

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,799
reason I tried to found ICD I another

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:36,690
example is a man named Harlan stem who's

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,159
the maintainer of of NTP classic the the

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:44,559
time synchronization software that my

00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:47,019
project NTP set forked from Heep his

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,759
well the details are kind of

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:52,870
embarrassing but his health got broken

00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:55,360
too he I he spent Oh 15 20 years out in

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,480
the wilderness keeping time

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,019
synchronization working and he could

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,909
barely get anybody to put to put a thin

00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,100
dime into supporting the work and yet

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:08,889
this is something credit card systems

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,080
bank transfer systems time-sensitive

00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:13,240
crypto they all depend on accurate time

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,549
synchronization simple synchronization

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,879
and yet there was never any connection

00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:21,100
from that but back to hey you know if

00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:23,289
the guy actually working on this didn't

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,460
have to scramble for grants constantly

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:28,240
and didn't have to worry about where his

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,980
next meal was coming from maybe we might

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,960
have a few more hours in this software

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,889
and a few fewer critical security bugs

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,350
so this is a serious problem

00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:40,809
load-bearing energy internet people when

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,250
they collapse can take critical services

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:47,710
down with them and with the more

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,169
dependent we get on Internet services

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,090
the worship prospect that gets so to

00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:54,040
hedge against that those of you who

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,450
understand the problem

00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,010
and if you have a respectable income

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,780
look around you find a load-bearing

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:06,460
internet person it doesn't have to be me

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,630
find a load-bearing internet person and

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:16,180
then dedicate $30 a month the price of a

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:19,060
decent restaurant bill and senator

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,730
remittance through PayPal or subscribe

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,910
store or any other way to do that and

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:27,070
the thing I'm after I thought of this

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,870
there's a risk in a system like this

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,660
that all of the attention and the money

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:35,380
will go to a few highly visible people

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,150
like for example me but I don't actually

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,440
want that to happen there's a little a

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,810
lot of people who are working on

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,850
infrastructure and much more obscurity

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,430
than me and they deserve support too so

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,340
what we need is fan-out instead of

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:52,450
setting $30 to one person try to

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,610
identify three load-bearing internet

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:59,170
people and send ten bucks to each of

00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:06,490
them and bucks a month not much to pay

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:10,900
to save your civilization so that's what

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:13,690
I hope you'll do and more than that

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,680
please spread the word there's a problem

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:19,450
we all have to join in solving it and

00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:23,590
the more we distribute the load the

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,180
better this will work so that comes to

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,370
the that gets the end of my rant about

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:32,380
infrastructure I I guess I could talk

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:34,590
about happy things now this is normally

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,330
is the point in my talk at which I would

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,920
invite interaction with the audience and

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,470
find out what you want me to talk about

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,710
but that's a little difficult under

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,040
these circumstances because I can't hear

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,040
you

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,470
Wow looks like I've put everybody asleep

00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,470
already

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:31,580
okay yeah yeah I tried that yeah yeah I

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,440
tried that I founded an organization

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:39,350
called the internet civil engineering

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,410
Institute I tried I can't hear him

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,410
anymore

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:48,140
so the answer is I tried that I tried

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,300
launching internet civil engineering

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,050
Institute I tried for seven years to

00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:57,200
make that work and I could not it turns

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,970
out finding people with the competence

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,820
and the bandwidth to run an organization

00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,100
like that is really hard so instead of

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,200
trying to centralize it in the best

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,600
tradition of Internet engineering we

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,410
make it robust by decentralizing it

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:15,280
distributing a load all of you do your

00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,720
own just a little bit of due diligence

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,360
look around you figure out what needs

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,070
support because so many of you have

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,590
different viewpoints and different ideas

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,780
about what's important that means the

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:34,150
funding will go to a large enough spread

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:34,150
that'll be useful next question

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,030
I do not know what that hand gesture

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,030
means

00:25:32,110 --> 00:26:09,039
hello hello wait wait wait I'm going to

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:20,860
answer that question but I'm going to do

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:35,110
it visually oh great so like I was going

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:38,309
to wait so you can't actually see does

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,309
that look fake to you

00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:27,580
yeah I think all of you should be doing

00:27:25,420 --> 00:28:00,280
that too every freaking company you work

00:27:27,580 --> 00:28:02,890
for well once it becomes known that

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,500
people are well okay I know how to solve

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:10,030
this problem

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,410
watch my blog I will blog about the

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,320
people who are in trouble and need

00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:16,360
support eventually there won't be only

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,360
one channel other people will be

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,860
advertising hey this project over here

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,480
needs some support

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:29,380
I could name half a dozen lead for

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:33,310
example the the open source firmware

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:35,440
stat for routers they desperately need

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,960
to be able to support support a full

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,860
time release engineer and integration

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,620
guy there's lots of worthy work out

00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,860
there but you wanted you wanted you

00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,790
wanted a tip on how to find that the

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,020
projects and the load-bearing and other

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,950
people who need support I'll get the

00:28:53,020 --> 00:29:01,000
ball rolling

00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:03,230
watch my blog and well in the meantime I

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,669
could use some more money

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:12,650
Oh medical bills man oh dear there is no

00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:16,150
such thing as minor surgery on the

00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,150
financial level let me put it that way

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:24,230
hi Eric are you familiar with the

00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:26,330
website act blue and their model no okay

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,150
I imagine the Institute was more of like

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,980
a major nonprofit approach to like board

00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,290
of directors and and try and build

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,450
infrastructure and all that yeah like

00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,880
what I tried to do whereas blue was

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,450
something set up by some Democrats to

00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,730
let rank-and-file donors give money to

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,830
whatever candidate they wanted to it was

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,280
like one website where if you want to

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:52,370
donate to a Nevada assembly woman and

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,799
you know a Connecticut House member and

00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,299
you know a Senate in your state you

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,470
could pick them all from this website

00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:59,030
and make donations to each of them

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,130
individually so it was one Clearing

00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,049
House so rather than a build and

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,760
Institute do you think that would be a

00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:07,549
model that might work in this case where

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:11,480
act blue as a website I believe takes

00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:13,669
like 1% or 2% of the donations just for

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,830
operating costs and all the money goes

00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:19,549
to the candidates you could build a

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:21,679
central platform that lists all of these

00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:24,020
people all these pillars of the

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,240
community and then that would connect

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:31,070
the rank-and-file donors and companies

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,200
to these people let me tell you why I'm

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,630
a little suspicious of approaches like

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:44,240
that they're subject to political

00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:46,490
capture which is which is why I will on

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,309
my blog I will advertise load-bearing

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,440
internet people and and projects that

00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:54,470
can use your support that can use your

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,520
remittances but I do not want to be the

00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,040
only authority on this I do not want to

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,760
be the only person doing that

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,840
advertising and that due diligence

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,980
because that's too much concentration of

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,980
power for anybody

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:37,020
yes I know frankly no they have other

00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:45,510
concerns they have enough to do keeping

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:50,430
their litigation shops running these are

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:52,260
all good questions by the way yes a

00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,240
question from someone who certainly

00:31:52,260 --> 00:32:03,330
didn't ask a question earlier about evil

00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:05,220
overlord so how do we keep this from the

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:10,020
inevitable case where someone who is not

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:12,300
a load-bearing person claims to be and

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,610
then poisons the well for everyone

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,420
because they shown that they can't be

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,820
trusted

00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,190
well I mean they're not poison the well

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,750
for everyone some people will get taken

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,540
in and send a remittance and they'll

00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,920
leave lose a few bucks a month but that

00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,430
doesn't mean the whole system will

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,800
collapse there will be some waste there

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:39,570
will be some people running scams that

00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:41,100
doesn't mean we shouldn't do it I do

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:46,500
believe so now you have depleted the

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:48,120
question posed very good then should I

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,120
sign offers or is there something else

00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,810
we ought to do well now that everything

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,190
is in its own really bodged way working

00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,290
smoothly if there's anything you were

00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,970
touching on early on during echo fest

00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,400
that you would like to reiterate more

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,710
clearly we can certainly do that okay

00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:11,670
let me gather my thoughts for a moment

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:14,120
here by the way that the person with

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,680
those two questions is in brewing

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,490
if by Apprentice he's doing good work

00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,490
treat him well

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:26,750
let's see victories yes we have won many

00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,020
victories let us exit on a high note

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:33,470
noting that these what I'm talking about

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,770
is a problem of success and and the

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,690
problems of success are much better to

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:45,110
have to deal with than the problems of

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:48,559
failure what else can I say

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,690
I'm sorry gentlemen I'm I'm not really

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,559
at my best I have someone with a

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:58,460
question one sec yeah so for those that

00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,740
on the other side of the coin you were

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,580
talking about a an apprentice here which

00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:08,000
sounds like a great idea is there a way

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:11,599
to encourage those that are load-bearing

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,290
internet people to reproduce themselves

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,109
into not just one but multiple

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:21,770
additional people to take their place

00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:25,700
upon their need to retire that is a very

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:27,320
good question and it's one that you kind

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,619
of opened up the conversation now and

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,950
that's good I have been trying to

00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:36,619
address that for years back around 1996

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:39,639
you might remember that I wrote this

00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:43,730
document called how to become a hacker

00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:48,470
and I've done similar things since and

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:51,470
the reason is that we have two large a

00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:53,419
culture for one-on-one individual

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:57,190
instruction to scale really well

00:34:53,419 --> 00:35:02,570
it's good when that can be arranged but

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:05,000
we need to build a corpus of artifacts

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,680
and documents and stuff that people can

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,099
immerse themselves in even in the

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,230
absence of mentors and I think that's

00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,880
the most effective way to do what you're

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,250
talking about people are going to have

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,920
to Train successors yes but before that

00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,690
will work we have to develop a larger

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,190
pool of people who want to be successors

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:28,130
so again that means a little cultural

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,290
engineering I don't I'm not quite sure

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,760
where I'm going with this we have two

00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,050
problems then they meet in the middle

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,450
one is that people aren't doing enough

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:39,320
formal mentoring and the other is we

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,210
need to be better at making our culture

00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,930
infectious so people want to join it and

00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,910
take on these roles I don't have

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,250
complete solutions to any of this but I

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:56,900
hope I'm showing a direction that we

00:35:49,250 --> 00:36:05,330
need to push in additional questions yes

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:07,610
one second but I wanted to say that I

00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,740
hadn't thought about your problem the

00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:13,700
problem that you said earlier but I did

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:15,440
I keep hearing about like smaller open

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,800
source things like for instance the

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,420
 and AWS issue and I find it

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,390
interesting that now now we're talking

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:28,370
about individuals - it is systemic and

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,480
one of the reasons I'm on focusing more

00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:34,460
on support for individuals is because

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,410
open source projects tend to be well

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,390
structurally weak they don't have formal

00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,580
organizations they're not legal entities

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:43,880
they don't even tend to have bank

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,530
accounts and what that means is that if

00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,230
you're going to have to pass if you're

00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:50,570
going to pass support to a project you

00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:53,420
almost always have to do it through

00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:56,630
individuals and once I got there I

00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,640
realized that we have the infrastructure

00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:01,250
for doing that patreon and subscribe

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,120
star exists those are the tools we need

00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:07,340
to learn to use in a systematic way and

00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,870
I'm grateful for the person who pointed

00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,270
out that there's a discovery from our

00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,970
problem you might want to spend your 30

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:19,610
$30 a month and not know who to spend it

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:21,860
on so once I get off the once I get out

00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,810
of this conference I'm going to sit down

00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:27,470
and start making a list of names and

00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:32,050
then I'm going to put out a blog post

00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:33,940
and hopefully that will start all of you

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:38,330
to get pointed in the right direction

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:40,790
all right another question mister I'll

00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:43,010
also say by the way that I have a

00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:45,620
threshold amount in my mind above which

00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,890
if my patreon feed gets

00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,250
than that I'm gonna say okay stop stop

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,200
stop

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:56,930
other people get more need to get more

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,300
money now I have enough so what was the

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,560
other question

00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,480
mr. Raymond said she released a

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:09,740
halloween paper since that time what is

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:12,260
your current I think Microsoft is

00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,090
internally very very conflicted on the

00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,910
one hand they have some people with real

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,880
vision there who realized that this is

00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,320
the open source is is not just the

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,150
present but the future and that they

00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,650
have to get along with it there are

00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:29,300
persistent persistent rumors that there

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,940
is a group inside Microsoft that's

00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,920
actually trying to re-engineer Windows

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,250
to be a layer on top of an open-source

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,350
kernel now how many of you heard those

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,730
rumors but the thing is given some other

00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,320
things other things I've heard coming

00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,260
out of Microsoft those rumors are

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,690
actually credible those there are people

00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,520
inside Microsoft who know that we won

00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,730
the engineering war and they're trying

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,260
to act on that on the other hand they've

00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,500
got a lot of people inside that

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,660
organization who are still in the old we

00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,820
must destroy all competition mindset and

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,700
still learn a very closed proprietary

00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,100
centered world and I don't think we can

00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,220
say at this point that Microsoft is one

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,540
thing in this respect there are factions

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,780
there are people pulling in different

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,610
directions and honestly from the outside

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:20,630
I'm not sure that there's much any of us

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:22,940
can do to influence that ok another

00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,160
question that was handed to me how do we

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,230
guard against corporations taking over

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,900
our grassroots decentralized funding

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,060
efforts for these load-bearing people

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,490
and gaining more control and influence

00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:37,460
to the detriment of the projects and the

00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:41,930
internet same for corporations picking

00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:43,430
the replacements so ok so how are they

00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,290
going to take over this decentralized

00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,630
funding effort by sending developers

00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:53,330
more money that doesn't sound like a

00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:57,570
problem to me one thing you can do is

00:39:53,330 --> 00:40:00,720
co-op these people on my patreon page

00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:04,230
I have to name tiers one is $20 a month

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,770
and one is $100 a month $100 a month is

00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:11,160
labeled institutional supporter and I

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,860
think other load-bearing internet people

00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,360
ought to have the distinction - I

00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,670
encourage I have three institutional

00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,230
supporters at the moment if you work for

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,420
a corporation that understands what's

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,720
going on and wants to be serious about

00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,880
giving support don't you give me money

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,760
tell your corporation send that

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,430
hundred-dollar remittance and then oh

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,530
boy you get that you've got a link to

00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,050
your webpage put in the credits page of

00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,360
all my projects we all have to worry

00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:43,230
about those people co-opting us we can

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,850
co-op them to touch to clarify on that

00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:48,270
earlier question I think it was a

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:51,750
concern of maybe a corporation hiring

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:53,070
away someone and kind of you know taking

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,860
over control of their revenue stream

00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,180
that way and then dismissing them and

00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,640
continuing for their own nefarious

00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,110
purposes well how can they do that the

00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,830
revenue stream is attached to the person

00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:06,270
not the project I believe maybe is a

00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,920
hypothetical condition of employment

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,810
something else something along those

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,240
lines and you know enticement that kind

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,620
of thing so I mean there are certain

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,520
kinds of evil that you can't hedge

00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:19,080
against you just have to notice that

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,380
they've happened after the fact and

00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,270
bailout I'm you know there's there's not

00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,100
much we can do to prevent that kind of

00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,900
thing in advance we can only notice when

00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:44,490
it's happened and raise a shitstorm

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:51,150
about it one more question with I will

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:55,520
think about that and I will I will push

00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,520
my thoughts on my blog yeah maybe we can

00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,940
what was that

00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:07,660
well I mean that's the channel I have at

00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,460
the moment I mean my blog isn't the

00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:15,040
right vehicle for this forever but at

00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,980
least it get the ball rolling in it if

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,960
you know if somebody wants to write to

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,470
start a site that is open source and

00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,690
community runs and is dedicated to

00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:28,390
advertising projects who need money I'm

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:31,990
totally in favor of that all right

00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:34,599
another question something for everyone

00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,880
to be generally aware of in this is we

00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:41,650
currently have patreon and subscribe

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,080
star we've already seen patreon kind of

00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,970
screw things up when they demonstrate

00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:59,830
that they will ban people for political

00:42:45,970 --> 00:43:02,369
reasons and by the way it's possible to

00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:05,080
set up recurring payments through PayPal

00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:07,960
what patreon brings to the table isn't

00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,930
recurring payments PayPal can do that

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,030
what PayPal brings to the table is

00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:15,369
people who are being supported get a

00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:17,260
dedicated channel to to communicate with

00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:22,089
their patrons and tell them about what

00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:26,380
they're doing so we actually do have

00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:28,660
some platform diversity for those of us

00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:33,160
in the room who don't know it what is

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:35,680
the URL to your blog if you just google

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:41,170
for es are armed and dangerous you'll

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,410
find it additional questions from the

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:46,359
crowd

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:47,680
any additional questions I guess if

00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:50,230
we're wrapping up now I want to

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,960
emphasize that it's not enough for the

00:43:50,230 --> 00:44:02,820
people in this room to all sign up and

00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:05,830
start shipping $30 a month I'm not dying

00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:08,109
we have to see that this this custom

00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:12,750
spreads across our whole culture because

00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:12,750
well the problem is at that scale

00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:16,930
if there are no further questions I

00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,660
would like to thank you for putting up

00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:21,550
with all the remote shenanigans and I'm

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,500
very happy that when Chrome froze it

00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,869
didn't freeze you into a really awkward

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:33,300
face you actually look what quite

00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:38,520
presentable as Chrome has frozen okay

00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,520
thank you random gods of Technology

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,869
thank you very much for being willing to

00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:46,119
play ball with us on remote talks yes

00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:49,089
sir I know you don't like them and I see

00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:51,430
your position is not one without merit

00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:55,619
it is very much very much well earned

00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:58,540
yeah you didn't know it was like this

00:44:55,619 --> 00:45:00,040
well Murphy does have a close

00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,660
relationship with the conference but

00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,180
this was pretty impressive even for us

00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:08,200
let me tell you four vid for video

00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:11,910
conferencing this is about typical I've

00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,910
never seen it get much better than this

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,849
no further questions and I'll kick it to

00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:17,349
speakerphone and hopefully we'll get a

00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:20,369
round of applause loud enough to bleed

00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:20,369
over even into my phone

00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:35,979
[Applause]

00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:35,979
