Title: Mykel Alvis - Developing for Deterministic Deliveries, the live version
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: 2019 SouthEast LinuxFest
Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019

The craft of producing quality software doesnâ€™t happen accidentally. Decades of engineering efforts, primarily in the manufacturing arena, have given us advice on producing repeatable, reliable outcomes.

The practice of engineering the processes of a development effort are often ad hoc. While that can clearly work well for trivial things, it tends to be under-clubbed for larger efforts. Likewise, intense process with constant updates and schedules is equally impossible to deal with. This talk will demonstrate an execution of the results of years of effort toward producing a workable middle ground, with smoother and more repeatable delivery.  

Note that some percentage of this talk will be live demonstration. So...no nets and  conference wifi.

how about now there we go cool seriously

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,950
here's the warning oh wow it catches it

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,020
from all the way down there that's

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,240
pretty awesome so I said I was gonna do

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,220
this live I'm not I did not make the

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,390
proper sacrifices the gods were not

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,730
appeased so I'm gonna the same talk I'd

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,290
normally do with this I'm just not gonna

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,420
do any the risky crap that would never

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,490
ever work in public wouldn't have worked

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,430
anyway so if you were here to watch me

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,370
fail at a live demo then I will not be

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,730
hurt if you decide to leave okay yeah

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:40,980
it's the truth y'all yeah so many so

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:43,260
many places are left to die here so how

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,150
is everybody how do you think thanks for

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,860
staying to the end of the thing it's a

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:52,320
like Sunday is usually the the day of

00:06:49,860 --> 00:07:00,240
nobody sticks around but I really

00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:08,130
appreciate you guys to help I I kind of

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:12,930
which I wasn't at this point you're an

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,040
idiot you should not choose me no one

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:20,900
should choose me over a pool party

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,900
and/or beer so hmm

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:33,270
so just so you recognize we are

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,830
currently feeding feeling through the

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,950
reasons why I didn't I'm not doing a

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,740
live demo because the network is not my

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,979
friend I definitely should have done

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,979
this before

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,900
no I'm good I'm gonna I'm gonna try my

00:07:47,840 --> 00:08:01,040
go to the to the other Network and we'll

00:07:50,900 --> 00:08:02,960
see how that looks works of course as

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,500
soon as I swap networks it starts

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,500
working correctly cancel cancel dude

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,860
sorry I gotta use hands

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:53,050
that's actually one that one of the what

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,050
do you call it uh stock

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,310
seriously

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,260
how do people actually live with these

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,100
trackpads and I watch people work with

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:34,029
these things all the time

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,029
I cannot imagine anything worse than

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:59,940
yeah they're economic the argonauts is

00:09:46,530 --> 00:10:04,890
good it is I got it yeah well not not

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:14,720
certainly not the at least the here's my

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:20,670
notes and I really care about okay ready

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:23,490
go uh okay hi my name is Michael Elvis I

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,350
am a software engineer I am super old I

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,090
am NOT the oldest person in this

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,110
building but I am almost certainly one

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,430
of the oldest people in this building

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,410
and I am almost certainly one of the

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,580
people who has been here way way longer

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,940
than I should

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,690
so this this conversation is about a

00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,300
thing that I hold rather deeply oh cool

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:52,260
it doesn't done in advance how awesome

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:55,320
is that y'all so I am really really fed

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,410
up with non-determinism I don't like

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,900
things not to be predictable I am really

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,839
unhappy when stuff doesn't work the way

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,630
I expect it to and so I've spent most of

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,170
the last 15 years not doing anything

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,790
other than trying to make those things

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,040
predictable so I only care about

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,380
enterprises so I am not particularly

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,390
nice about how I say things but I if you

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,820
don't make any money at what you do then

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,530
your your vaguely uninteresting to me

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,880
and that's not because you're not

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,070
interesting it's because I have some

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,020
specific needs so my name is Michael

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,900
Elvis I work for a company called array

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,200
consulting I am array consulting and I'm

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,420
a consultant and DevOps coach so what

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,320
that means is I teach you how to be

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,630
better at development delivery I ascribe

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
to lawful evil I have some neutral

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,360
tendencies which is to say I don't

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,000
automatically like to do all the evil

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,310
things but I am very fixated on

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,350
deterministic outcomes very very fixated

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,270
on them and I'm probably not a

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,100
shape-shifting lizard man but if you get

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,720
this thing and

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,860
that link you will figure out why I said

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:05,780
that and I am Michael Albus basically

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,040
everywhere so the must most of the work

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,920
that I do is in a regulated industry

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,790
which is why a lot of this is important

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,960
now I don't really think everybody in IT

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,470
is a big crybaby

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,360
not really but it is certainly the case

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,520
that some of them are so you're probably

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,130
a developer or an operations person or a

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,360
tester or an analyst or a PM or

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,990
something along those lines and that's

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,280
great but you are pretty much all trying

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,020
to do the same thing or have the same

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,630
intent to get the real get a result and

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,830
you write code you deploy code you talk

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,510
about getting code or you insert

00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,370
features something along those lines and

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,530
maybe you document that but you probably

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,240
don't and maybe you realize how hard it

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,650
is to do this kind of stuff with with

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,050
with or without you but you probably

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:51,650
don't but process engineering is not a

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,480
solved problem we it will never really

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,060
be a solved problem this is never going

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,590
to go away nothing I do or you do or any

00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,780
of us do is going to solve this problem

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,780
all we can do is edge towards something

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,570
a little more a little more

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:07,760
deterministic and the nothing you do

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,650
under the circumstances prevents you

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,480
from doing good engineering except

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,490
you're kind of lackadaisical attitude

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,040
and you're in one willingness to improve

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,690
your skill nobody who is at this

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,880
conference is unwilling to improve

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,020
themselves no they're not you wouldn't

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,430
you wouldn't have shown up nobody I

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,890
don't think anybody got forced to come

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,120
here and so you're not you're here

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,080
because you want to learn some things

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,540
you want to interact with some people

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,370
but when you get back to whatever place

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,440
it was you are wherever you are you're

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,680
you might you know that guy that woman

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,500
that that man that person who just seems

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,180
to be showing up they're like yes good

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,060
enough maybe you're the good enough

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,950
person that's okay too but you're it's

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,010
the skill and discipline are the two

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,800
pieces of this that matter and you

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,780
cannot buy this you can't buy it from me

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,250
you can't buy it from anybody that you

00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,950
know you can't buy it from a vendor of

00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,710
any sort it is almost impossible to buy

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,810
discipline it is almost impossible to

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,980
and even when you do you're not getting

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,530
the discipline that you thought you were

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,990
or you wanted so I do this thing in

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,760
every presentation and what

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,990
is I'm going to tell you everything that

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,970
I want to tell you in this conversation

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,440
and if you you're like okay this guy's

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,779
an idiot you can leave that's totally

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:23,140
okay so my plan every time every client

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:27,040
every team for years and years is to

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:30,160
provide limited assurance you say I'm

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,560
going to do these things and I'm not

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,610
gonna do anything else and they go whoa

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,020
but we need you do these other things

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,020
you go okay what I say what I'm gonna do

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,149
I'm gonna promise you that I'm gonna do

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,980
these things and I'm gonna do those

00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,320
things and if we have time or there's

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,580
something later yeah we would do you

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,670
another thing those things are super

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,410
important you're like now hmm you know

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,570
I'll provide these things these are the

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,220
things I know I can provide those are

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,480
the things you want we'll see how that

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,510
goes

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,670
you provide limited assurance you make a

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,100
relatively inoffensive architecture to

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,470
provide that assurance something that

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,250
doesn't look something that's not clever

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,950
I am fed up to about there with clever

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,500
in my life I have a bunch of people who

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,000
are super clever around me and they're

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:23,020
like hey we could do the thing with the

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,480
thing in the PPU I'm like yeah or we

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,339
could write a service one monolithic

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,600
service that does the one thing that you

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,500
actually need done and then we could go

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,839
on to the next thing

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,440
yeah but it's not cool and I'm like yeah

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,240
I know I'm old I like things to work I

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,020
don't like them to be cool I'm not

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,140
clever I don't want to be you apply

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,209
process to get that process is how you

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,070
run your run their luck the way through

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,510
your life and then you apply more

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,520
testing to that process to make sure

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,750
that your process is actually executing

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,630
the process the way that you think it

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,260
should and you want immutable outcomes

00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:01,959
if you do not do this you are doomed to

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,930
a certain sort of failure or at the very

00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,570
least you're doomed to random success

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,899
which is in my world the same thing and

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,670
fail you just succeeded you don't know

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,310
why or you succeeded and you don't you

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,579
can't prove why or you succeeded for a

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,710
few minutes and then everything went to

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:23,360
the toilet and you're sad and

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,640
as I have said to many people from many

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,800
times many times across my life my

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,000
default state is I want you to be happy

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,340
I do I don't think about much of anybody

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,940
but myself but I want everybody to be

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,030
happy

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,500
unless I want you to be sad and the only

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,530
way I can think that I would want you to

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,680
be sad as if you'd done something to me

00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,120
and like I'm gonna do anything to me any

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,400
more than I'm gonna do anything to you

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,660
so why don't why don't we just try to

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,660
all be happy under these circumstances

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,390
and in order to be happy I believe it is

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,970
damn near impossible to do that without

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:03,910
having an immutable result you want to

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:08,690
deal with your dependencies this seems I

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:10,100
don't know implicit like like I don't

00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,540
know I have to say this out loud but

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,670
apparently I have to say it to a lot of

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,170
people a lot of times you have to manage

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,730
your dependencies that's like I in my

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,190
opinion that is somewhere between 50 and

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,470
75 percent of a developer's job is to

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,959
manage dependencies your language may be

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,330
good at it it may be bad at it but you

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,550
this is a thing you must do if you do

00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,930
not do this if you are not sure what the

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,260
ingredients and what your software

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:36,290
supply chain looks like you are randomly

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,300
succeeding a lot of JavaScript seems to

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,940
be randomly succeeding and you

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,800
definitely want continuous improvement

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,530
you want this process to continue to

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,960
grow as it can you want to use your

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,270
immutable results from some from some

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,850
location and you want to do that in

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,260
order to get the the kind of

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,910
deterministic outcomes that you're like

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,260
given a result is immutable and the

00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,670
storage is immutable then when you did

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,350
the thing and it was right and you go

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:05,360
fetch it again it still as right as it

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:07,220
was before and if some person changed

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,260
that well that's one of those things

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,230
that tends to make me want to make a

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,880
person sad and so I don't think that's

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,740
necessary I think that's actually the

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,930
goal here is to get us to the place

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,020
where we produce immutable outcomes in

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:26,440
an unchanging repository I basically

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:30,290
repo now how do you really do this well

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,600
this is where I tend to verge from the

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,570
way that most people in development do I

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,550
am very very focused on

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,870
a formal release process you know

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,250
there's a bunch of underlined words in

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,540
here these are the things that matter I

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:46,580
am I use controlled source code I know

00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,140
that sounds like the thing but it isn't

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,240
always a thing if you're not using real

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,120
source code management and and a process

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,330
for your source code flow ye you're back

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,790
to almost random success I use managed

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,370
dependencies explicitly pinned to a

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,740
version not i nev ER zijn one dispersion

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,290
two people do that that's cool

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,800
random success people your randomly

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,810
succeeding i use version two bills

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,330
specifically I used semantically version

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,250
Vil's where the API is based on where

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:20,810
the version number indicates an api

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:23,930
compatibility I test the crap out of it

00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,490
and this is where it gets a little weird

00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,080
because testing the crap out of certain

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,420
things as easy and testing the crap of

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,470
other things is darn near impossible if

00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,760
you didn't go to Garrett's talk the

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,790
other day about inspect that's a way to

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,620
test one piece of this there's a bunch

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,000
of ways to test things and I'm not here

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,120
to tell you what those ways are I'm

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,880
telling you to do it we continuously

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,380
integrate these changes the bill every

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,140
build really needs to be tested

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,540
obviously but every commit could

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,800
technically be built and therefore if

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,870
you're gonna test every build and build

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,240
every commit your testing every commit

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,730
and if you don't well that's ok but when

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,670
you make a commit and the tests fail you

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,320
kind of need to go fix that and we

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:07,640
produce immutable artifacts out of that

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,260
that we keep forever where forever is

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,960
defined as whatever you're doing

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,660
retention policy is you might yours is

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,500
probably forever it could be forever

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,340
depending on where I'm working it's

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:23,030
either 30 days three months or ten years

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:26,660
whatever so there's a way you write your

00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,610
code you unit test it you identify it

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,960
with a version the namespace in the

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,430
version of a thing is the primary

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,650
identifier of that thing that you're

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,630
going to build you know that that that

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,340
for an identification when you do a

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,260
build you're gonna release your gonna

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,490
tag that release you're gonna make a tag

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,350
another thing you're gonna check out the

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,900
tag and make the artifact from the check

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,610
out why do you do that well because

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,040
source code management especially if

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,100
it's done by you can totally up

00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,890
Tagg so you want to know that the tag is

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,290
right so if you said the tag indicates

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,360
the the thing that I'm releasing and I

00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,910
said I tagged this code and then I built

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,110
this code well no you really didn't you

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,490
didn't build that tag you built this

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,680
because well the tags are the same line

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:10,430
really okay really

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:13,750
I you're wrong you're you're you're

00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,920
trivially provably wrong because

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,000
frequently what has happened is there's

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,490
things you're not committing to source

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,080
code that are like part of your part

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,930
you're a little private world it's a

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,280
build on my machines problem so I ought

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,720
to be able to build that tag the same

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,550
way you build that tag or at least in

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,230
the world where there's configuration of

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:34,880
build capabilities I ought to be able to

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,160
do it I think you save the artifact the

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,340
thing you built from that tag gets stuck

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,950
somewhere forever this is having a

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,070
having a caching proxy artifact

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,230
repository is just an estimate that's

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,460
just good sense now a lot of lot of

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,200
languages have will trouble with that

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,700
especially languages that happen to use

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,460
source code control as their dependency

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,310
managers a couple of those come to mind

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,140
I hate that with burning passion of a

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,550
thousand suns but I'm not the person

00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,750
makes that decision you're probably not

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,980
the person that makes decision to use

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,740
that language and that's not my problem

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,240
but no matter what the problem is you

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,010
got to figure out a way to manage those

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,480
dependencies and save those artifacts

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:17,050
you use the artifacts never the source

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,400
once you've produced a release you stop

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,080
talking about the source that was just

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,390
how you got here this is where we are

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,670
the contents of that artifact repository

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,310
that you put your immutable artifact in

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,520
are the thing there is no other thing

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,770
the source code is crap it's lies for

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,870
all practical purposes who cares it

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,110
might as well be just like it might as

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:42,680
well be that that X that you hate we

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,540
repeat this process until we die or get

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,310
fired or go doing a job or make a

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,330
different one or you come to me and

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,920
you're like hey here's why you're

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,510
categorically wrong I would like for you

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,920
to change your process and be like huh

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,840
turns out you're right I'm gonna change

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,270
it because that's what continues

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,250
improvements like so I'm gonna define

00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:01,640
some of these things an artifact is a

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,850
thingy I know that seems really seems

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,170
very uh

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,170
very technical it's a thingy its

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,630
collection of bytes that has a name and

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:12,810
it's a bucket of stuff that has some

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,230
identifier attached to it a platform for

00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:19,470
me is a is a place you want to some

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,670
artifact to be available to a consumer

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,070
that's where you want it you want it to

00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:28,860
go somewhere an environment is some

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,090
precisely configured platform now these

00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,800
are these are the way this is the way I

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,210
talk if I if you're like hey I need you

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,620
to come fix my problem because we have

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,330
these huge problems I will talk in these

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,370
terms and I will not talk in your terms

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,830
these are the terms that I will talk in

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,960
because these are probably more precise

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,380
than your terms and they map to things

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,640
that I can back up every single time so

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,130
you got an environment that's a

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,170
precisely configure like like prod your

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,090
prod environment is a configured

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,190
platform but it's a specific configured

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,720
platform that probably looks a bit like

00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,780
your test platform which is probably

00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,820
configured slightly differently

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,860
availability means that you that you can

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:11,310
be thing can be accessible to your

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:13,860
consumer a version is an identifying

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,020
signature of an artifact now sa version

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,550
like version is not just a number it's

00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,860
the namespace around that with the

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:24,540
number but the version number is also

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:27,900
very important build means to produce a

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,550
potential artifact and release means to

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,470
build an immutable version of an

00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:36,390
artifact and deployment is the is the

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,030
act of inducing availability into an

00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,980
environment I'm AI deployed a thing

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,250
that's an action deploy is an action

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,700
it's not noun I deploy a thing I don't

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,930
have a deploy I is the production of

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,870
availability

00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,540
so the pedantic view of this is that

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:56,430
everything in your life has a process

00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:58,680
literally everything you you have an

00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,050
order that you take do things in you

00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,910
might swap that order around but you you

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,770
got out you have a process that you take

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,240
that every that you flow through across

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,010
the course of a day and all the flows

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,010
change over time so you've got to be

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:15,810
willing to do continuous updates on this

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,650
and jobs that's your job the thing you

00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,630
do that is

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:22,440
just an execution of the flows that you

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:24,090
get paid to execute so when we talk

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,730
about this we use the process to

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,260
increase more of the pieces of the

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,620
outputs that we want more of the illa

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,910
d's repeatability reliability

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,360
verifiability observability ability

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:39,180
Billy Billy Billy so when you say that

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,920
there's a just because there's a fixed

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,270
process for a thing that doesn't mean

00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,940
you're always going to execute it that

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,850
way every time you can fail you can do

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,530
it wrong right so nobody's like nobody's

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,720
got a gun to your head that says you got

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,210
a fixed process if you if you step wrong

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,250
you die nobody does that

00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,150
I hope nobody does that if you do that I

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,890
know a grief counselor so but you've got

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,290
this you've got a situation that says

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:08,220
you can fail at this if you don't well I

00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:11,400
mean you know mm-hmm anyway chaos is

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,880
always around you that your missteps the

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,300
Sun you know we call it a solar flares

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,410
and and dying systems and failed hard

00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,270
drives and all these things these are

00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,520
all parts of the failure possibilities

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,770
chaos is everywhere it's not your friend

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,560
but it isn't also isn't necessarily your

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,030
enemy because sometimes failures tell

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,930
you things that you that successes

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:36,180
couldn't and so it shows you the edges

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,430
of your system first of all if you fail

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,690
you now know where there's an edge maybe

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,400
you'd even know that if you've never

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,370
failed at releasing a piece of software

00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,250
which that's hilarious but anyway if

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,900
you've never failed at that then maybe

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,030
you don't know what it's like what it

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,890
what a failed release looks like that's

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,260
a binary state arrangement there's some

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,720
success criteria you either did it or

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,670
you didn't and if you've never not done

00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,950
it you don't know really know what those

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:06,270
criteria are so I have a word that I use

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,070
a lot in this talk it's called

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:13,950
determinism so there's a couple of them

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,080
in Webster's belief of all events caused

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,490
by basically there's kind of determinism

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,730
that says you are not in control of your

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,980
life

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,870
you have no control over your life this

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,760
that everything is predetermined

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,680
that's a weird kind of determinism to me

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,410
that's like kind of a funky one but

00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,710
there's other one that says that acts of

00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,710
will

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,000
that the acts of the will occurrences in

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,980
nature social or psychological phenomena

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,500
are causally determined by preceding

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,630
events or what I like to say frequently

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,870
is today is the result of all your

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:50,460
yesterday's present you is that is the

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:56,010
net law a journaling log of past you yes

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:59,310
sir exactly exactly that you got here by

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,650
screwing up hopefully hopefully you

00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,540
screwed up some because that's that is

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,490
the primary learning mechanisms we have

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,560
is making mistakes and the pain that

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,510
comes along with that but you're a

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,660
journaling log that is rolled up to

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:15,150
present you I will very frequently say

00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,790
the phrase future you hates present you

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,580
because you are stealing things from

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,950
future you all the time every time you

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,440
do something that isn't exactly right

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,180
usually it's the way you still you did

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,320
it was you stole from future you

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,030
you said mm-hmm run this test well yeah

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,080
Jason's got a big cup of ice cream or

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,570
something is that what that is yeah

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,270
that's stealing from future you that's

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,220
like yeah present me thinks this ice

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:44,310
cream be awesome future me is like why

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,970
the hell did I eat this yeah say that a

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,600
lot actually

00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,130
so big deal so your stuff is probably

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,750
pretty complicated and probably pretty

00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,190
airpl on it probably has more steps than

00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,230
should it's probably very difficult to

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,960
replicate does that the case for anybody

00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:00,510
in here anybody have a rough process

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,230
something that stings a bit you're like

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:06,420
do you not wanna do this anybody don't

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:11,040
anybody's life they just go my process

00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:13,590
is bad ass like yeah I'm gonna stand up

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,240
here and be like man that thing when it

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,460
fails it fails gracefully and we can

00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,390
just keep doing it well you got one but

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,430
you probably had the others that are

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,910
screwy too so don't don't try that I

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,410
don't try that crap with me oh you got

00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,610
one shoot that was actually a you were

00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:33,920
actually asked Oh tell me tell me tell

00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:33,920
me mhm

00:29:36,950 --> 00:30:11,610
right you're running - tea in the SSH

00:29:53,130 --> 00:30:19,260
call terminal emulation si go right

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:21,120
there seriously you might know oh okay

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,080
yeah I can be I can be challenging

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,060
certainly right so you got this thing

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,560
he's like Jason look at this human

00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,090
centric situation where it's like I

00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,060
can't do this with a tool because

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,980
because chaos in turn injects itself in

00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,660
the middle of this nonsense he even

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,010
knows what this chaos generation engine

00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,900
is and he doesn't know how to tame it

00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,570
we've taught we had a bunch of talks

00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,610
this week about uh about slaying dragons

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,860
and how things how things go sideways

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,140
and that sort of stuff yeah welcome to

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,430
software are people you know the you can

00:30:49,140 --> 00:31:00,290
have the most perfect process and it

00:30:50,430 --> 00:31:00,290
still can can die on you yes sir okay

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:18,890
yeah absolutely you absolutely build

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,770
that the checks that say the thing did

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,780
what I thought it would so determinism

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:27,590
the Turman ISM as I'm talking about it

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:29,750
now is not is not perfect determinism at

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,720
any point its determinism at a moment

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,190
right the deterministic outcome of that

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,130
bill like for instance spinning up a

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,020
server in AWS is that takes time if you

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:42,320
go take an ami you so you have even if

00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,210
you had a perfect ami that was small and

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,549
spun up there's a time frame associated

00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:51,679
with that most tools most good tools

00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:53,510
goodish tools when you use those tools

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,039
to do that they have a they take that

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:59,929
into account and they use Amazon's on

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,549
logarithmic ly increasing timeout

00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:03,350
periods for checking to see you know

00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:08,480
it's like wait 10 seconds wait 30

00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:10,909
seconds wait 150 seconds etc etc it

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,809
isn't determinism isn't immediate and it

00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:18,110
is but it isn't and it isn't necessarily

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:20,720
bounded by your desire it's a result at

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:23,179
some time not at the time you thought it

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,190
was more specifically if you do have a

00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:29,270
time flip time limit or a time frame

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:31,789
then it's easy 15 minutes from now if

00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,350
this thing's not done it's never going

00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:36,500
to be done and you just destroy it

00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:40,850
that's the math that I want I need this

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,470
within 10 seconds mmm damn y'all you go

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,110
man that's gonna be fine let's see how

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,330
that goes but just because the thing

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,400
that you want is deterministically

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,260
possible doesn't mean that the criteria

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,120
for your deterministic need is going to

00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,990
be met and so you just have to know what

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,760
that means for yourself so it is

00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:02,980
frequently we have these things that are

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:05,360
human centric but I have this this

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,070
statement that I cannot believe any

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,010
other way in an in an enterprise

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:15,140
certainly but in almost all cases your

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:17,809
only job yet one job Fred yet one job

00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,090
your only job is to deliver the value

00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:20,840
that you have promised to your customer

00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,690
nothing else matters

00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,549
literally nothing else matters

00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,640
determinism or happiness or your your

00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:30,640
your pulse none of those things matter

00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Jason

00:33:36,859 --> 00:34:01,559
people hmm then it's not done sure

00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:03,749
delivery right so a few minutes ago I

00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,579
had some deafened words that I said that

00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:07,769
that what that meant right

00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:10,980
so when you say done what you mean is

00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:12,539
available is it available what is

00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,889
available mean well I'll go go look at

00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:15,269
Michael slide that asks what available

00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,519
means that means it's been it's been

00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:19,710
induced to be accessible by somebody

00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,139
you're like oh it's not available

00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,960
you're not done so mapping your mapping

00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,460
terms to precision maybe you want to use

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,889
a different term that's cool don't care

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,349
you might use the term done and that's

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,899
that's good but you need very precise

00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:35,639
definitions for what those are because

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,769
if you don't you really don't have

00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,929
determinism determinism is itself

00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:43,279
dependent on precise definition of

00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:48,169
success in failure criteria every time

00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:50,909
but I can say this one without regard

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:52,769
this is what you're here for I don't

00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,599
care if you are in if you are in

00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:56,879
software at any point any point of the

00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,950
delivery chain that's what your job is

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,420
you're a developer oh my I develop

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,970
features now you don't you deliver value

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,940
to the customer I'm in operations I make

00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,950
the developer's code run no you deliver

00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,750
value to the customer I'm a project

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,009
manager nope you deliver value to the

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,230
customer how am I supposed to deliver

00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:17,759
value the customer I'm like oh you don't

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:20,579
have any part of that you're like what

00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:22,170
we call redundant if you're not

00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,170
delivering value to the customer why are

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,450
we why are you why are you even here who

00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:30,000
are you I believe I believe we mean to

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:33,000
make a call to HR so having the capacity

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,069
to do this right is a team effort

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,160
it's a DevOps see kind of like huggy

00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:39,960
feely crap but ultimately do you got a

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,630
process you're gonna do it but it's

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,029
probably dumb the process probably

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,640
anybody think their process is dumb

00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:50,070
anybody what everybody okay some of them

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,050
are sure well all of them are dumb

00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,270
all software's broken we're terrible

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,320
human beings we really just don't belong

00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:01,080
here but given my parents like did not

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,910
have me killed was a child so I think I

00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:07,140
should probably at least honor their

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:09,840
choice so we have dumb processes we do

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,130
dumb things and we do that stuff but we

00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:17,700
are really good at iterating on those

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:21,390
things we suck at everything I have the

00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:24,630
privilege burden of knowing a bunch of

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:27,270
professional magicians and they will

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,790
tell you people suck they are terrible

00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,680
at everything you can make a thing go

00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,950
from left to right and they'll just be

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,210
like oh they can't see I can't hear they

00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,920
can't remember hell they could barely

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,500
remember who remembers what they had for

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,420
breakfast four days ago I know what I

00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,420
did because I didn't need anything four

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,980
days ago but you know you don't remember

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,320
a bunch of stuff because it doesn't

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,970
matter but you can't see when the

00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,330
three-card Monte is going because that's

00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,340
the whole point but you've got this

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:59,040
you're terrible everything except

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,190
getting better at everything that's like

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,350
I mean that's what growing up is about

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:07,380
so what you want is you want to play

00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:10,140
video games all day that's what I want I

00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,560
want to be able to play video games all

00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:17,340
day all day long I even said this to my

00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,820
CEO I said Doug don't play video games

00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,560
all day

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,620
he's like why would I pay you to play

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,030
video games all day I'm like well

00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,610
technically speaking everything's great

00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,390
and he goes yeah but why would I pay you

00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,590
and I'm like you think they got that way

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,050
so that's what I want I want to play

00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,640
video games all day and I only want to

00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,480
be bothered with anything if there's

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,710
something that's actually wrong and

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,260
under those circumstances I think that's

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,810
pretty reasonable I want automated stuff

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,880
I want my deployments automated I want

00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,710
my bills automated I want my testing

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,920
automated and I don't see a reason I

00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,590
have yet to find a reason no compelling

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,100
reasons that I cannot stop on the ground

00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:03,030
and destroy for not doing that it's too

00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,869
hard oh remember discipline and skill

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,240
from the

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:09,150
beginning of the talk I get enough of

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,490
that it's not that hard anymore who here

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:16,289
knows how much of their code is actually

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:18,089
tested this ballpark it zero ok that's

00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:21,930
knowing right you know the number is

00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:25,170
zero great but these two folks seem to

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,519
think and is it zero ok ok so zero all

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,210
right so you're in the zero group that's

00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:32,880
not the same thing that's like cheating

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:36,809
ok but some sometimes you know right you

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:41,190
know I kind of know right but if your

00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:43,950
process says well if you don't know and

00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:48,569
more importantly when you know if it's

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:49,890
not enough fail and you go but but we

00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:50,940
got to get stuff in production oh my go

00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:54,450
you'd better get your damn tests up

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,339
brother you know you you I'm looking for

00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,650
some continuous improvement in your life

00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:00,630
you're the developer you are you're the

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,519
tester or you're the devops nerd or

00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,210
whatever you are and you're gonna keep

00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:10,109
producing increased and better outcomes

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,730
or I'm gonna know why and that is the

00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:14,369
part where we go back to that place

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:17,970
where I said my default feeling is that

00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:19,799
I don't want you to be happy but if I

00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:23,599
want you to be sad I can assure you I

00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:27,299
know how to make people sad I'm like

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,220
super good at it and so if you're gonna

00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:32,549
show up and be like I don't give a

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,299
about this testing stuff oh man me

00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:36,930
either

00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:38,910
oh no I totally do could you like move

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,170
along please you're gonna want to update

00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,210
a LinkedIn profile or something like

00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,239
that that thing matters

00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:48,390
I want automated maintenance of those

00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:50,249
deployments I wanna know what I kind of

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,859
want them to be self-healing that's a

00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:55,680
little harder but honestly it's just one

00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:57,720
level up of deterministic it just stays

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,670
the way I want it to be it stays the way

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,430
it's working now I want documentation I

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:08,730
want to know that you know and that you

00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:10,380
are able to tell me what success looks

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,680
like what the criteria is really going

00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,589
to be I want reliability in that system

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,610
in the delivery system I want to be able

00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:20,880
to do Lorelei

00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:24,030
on you because I wanna wait for it play

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,710
video games all day and so under the

00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,270
circumstances if it's not repeatable and

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,770
reliable I'm not gonna be able to do

00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,170
games in it and that's gonna make it so

00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,990
that I need to make you sad and so I

00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,540
don't want to do that I want I just want

00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:38,940
it to work and I want other people to be

00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,630
able to think that it works too in my

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,220
business

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:44,580
in my business for years now

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,170
auditability is just key and the coolest

00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,730
thing about all of this is if you have

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,590
automated deployments automated bills

00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:52,140
automated releases automated testing

00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,280
you also get outputs from all those

00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,790
things that are typically very

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,710
consistent and incredibly auditable like

00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,910
what is your what well why should have

00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,960
want to look it looks like that

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,520
terraform script right there it's like

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,010
well about what is that I'm like it's

00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,170
not terrifying right there what are your

00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,430
well how do you know that your security

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,020
rules are being enforced well that's

00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,020
that big pile of inspectors right there

00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:18,930
sorcery you get some you get some

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,620
old-school crusty you know ten thousand

00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:24,930
year old security walk who's like raw

00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:28,500
sorcery burn the witch and you're like

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:30,540
dude come on this is I'm trying to help

00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,970
you here I got a test and it says a

00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,770
thing and like you can read it like no

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,810
you have to have the checklist in the

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,390
excel file I'm like why don't you set

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:43,340
yourself on fire and he goes because I'm

00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:43,340
in charge of you and I'm like oh really

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:53,760
um do I have a say in that

00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:55,260
No you have a boss you talk about this

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,050
let's talk about whether your ways

00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,200
better than my way whether I can produce

00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:04,140
auditability you can't you're a liar you

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,980
have a drug habit you're a drunk you're

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:11,730
careless you have dyslexia uu transpose

00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:15,060
the words true and refrigerator I don't

00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:17,610
know whatever it is you're human my

00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,730
machine man that thing runs like a

00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:25,290
machine and that machine produces

00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:27,510
reliable auditable output so we're

00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,550
frequently desperately seeking these I

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,700
think I should probably put that in some

00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:33,970
sort of online proof

00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:36,160
or whatever but the point is is that we

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,320
want predictable deterministic in our

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,030
case means predictable I'm gonna do a

00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,350
thing in the expected output is this

00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,770
thing and if it isn't that thing then

00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:47,350
it's like well something's wrong if it's

00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,660
not predictable then the Delta state is

00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:52,390
something's wrong

00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,250
so the other part is that well okay yeah

00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:56,650
anyways how I'm using predictable it

00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:59,500
means reasonably predictable too that's

00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:00,670
not like I'm gonna this is gonna sound

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,020
kind of funny coming from me for people

00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:06,490
who know me but you don't have to be an

00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:08,440
 about it you don't have to you

00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:11,110
can be like well it failed this time

00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,320
it's like oh well what happened well I'm

00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:16,450
really sure I might okay you can't blame

00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,450
people for failure that just makes them

00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:21,100
hide stuff if you don't if you don't

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,450
know that then you should read us a

00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,280
couple of books about blameless

00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:27,460
blamelessness and blameless cultures

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,740
those are real you know me blaming a

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,590
person for a thing do they help you at

00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,720
all resolve the thing and make it so

00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,090
it's harder to do the problem do the

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,460
wrong thing next time that is way better

00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:41,200
my way is just better than yours if you

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,150
were into play if you want to if if you

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,520
have a CEO comes down and pounds tables

00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:48,100
and ass who's head needs to roll my way

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,010
is better my way psychologically test

00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,410
ibly provably better than firing

00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,000
somebody because they made a mistake if

00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,350
you're firing somebody because they make

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,480
this doesn't make a mistake person I

00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,310
think you're an and I'm

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,240
perfectly happy to tell you that to your

00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:08,380
face I don't I I can get another job

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,890
comma totally if you are the

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:14,230
sort of person who places blame it's

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,420
somebody's fault of course it is they

00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:19,480
did something did you think they were

00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,880
trying to bring a company down maybe

00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,680
you're the it's ridiculous

00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,840
nobody comes to work every day and goes

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,560
today IBM stock goes into the toilet

00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,060
nobody does that

00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,770
why would they do that there's no

00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,260
there's practically no with that shoot

00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:38,750
there's a lot of value on that in there

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:41,390
hmm I have to change this talk

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,050
but there are constraints on

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,680
reasonability

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,310
and those constraints ought to be a

00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:52,510
predictability and those constraints

00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:55,180
ought to be very reasonable yes sir on

00:44:52,510 --> 00:45:00,590
yes

00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:01,280
hey if I can remember it's red hey yeah

00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,440
that's it

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,150
also the field guide to understanding

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,640
human error if you have not read this

00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,099
book you should read that book dr.

00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,440
Sidney Decker is a genius he studies

00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:14,480
airplane crashes and if you don't think

00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,180
airplane crashes have the same kinds of

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,320
behaviors that software failures do well

00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,119
then you should probably read that book

00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,770
and you will come away from it going huh

00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:29,260
bad deploys are like airplane crashes

00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:31,430
with fewer dead people hopefully so

00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,560
reasonably predictable is pretty darn

00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:36,490
good but actual determinism is

00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,490
impossible yes sir

00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:46,790
yeah well we or or at least you don't

00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:51,130
build um at least you don't build

00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:54,349
preemie baby monitors so is that right

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:56,240
so how do we do this we're trying to

00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:58,160
solve an impossible problem and produce

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,740
an impossible result with deficient

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,980
tools and an often unreasonable standard

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,720
and you approach it well I use source

00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,599
code control to handle everything

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,599
I treat everything like it was a build

00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:15,260
problem and the build fails if it is not

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,589
right now you may not do that you may

00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:20,330
not want to do that a you ain't know and

00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:26,000
a shove everything to the left that far

00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:28,670
I have a 1,000 batting rack epic record

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,109
on this I've literally never failed when

00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:36,560
I did this not ever I am 42 I'm 42 years

00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:39,320
into my career I've been doing this

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:43,359
since I was 10 years old and every time

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:47,030
I do that I have had a full unqualified

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:49,240
unequivocal success so who in here can

00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,349
say they've added a thousand at anything

00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,220
you've added a thousand at not having

00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:55,220
tests

00:46:52,220 --> 00:47:00,440
congratulations way to go but every time

00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:01,849
I do this it works the way you expect it

00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,030
to now granted I'm changing the rules

00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:07,070
every single time right I'm my rules are

00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,690
the way that I know it works as I looked

00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,369
at the output and is the output I expect

00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,990
it and you're like well what if you just

00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:15,020
expected crappy output into them like if

00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:17,000
I got it I succeeded if your

00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:20,380
expectations are low and you get low

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,670
outcomes you succeeded

00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:27,920
does anybody know when this is supposed

00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:29,270
to be over is it now okay laughter I was

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,800
like I'm hoping I'm hoping am i eating

00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:33,050
three minutes of somebody's time at this

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,160
point if you know how many slides were

00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,550
left in this deck he would be worried

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,840
about that

00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:42,320
so I go to source control I use it and

00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:44,200
if you do not I I'm not gonna call you

00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,730
an but at least you're a fool

00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,290
you need to learn to do margins properly

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,760
if you don't know how to do mergers

00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,560
properly that's and you're a software

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:56,300
engineer of any sort including the kind

00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,950
that writes infrastructure is code you

00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,500
have a new you have a new homework task

00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:10,220
yes sir you know how do you sort of

00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:11,390
emerges properly Jason I everybody say

00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,390
goodbye to Jason cause I'm killing him

00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,890
after all this

00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:18,650
you establish yourself a good workflow

00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:20,680
and the tool you use is way less

00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,420
important than the workflow you use

00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,300
subversion is a perfectly valid source

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:28,190
code control system RCS is a perfectly

00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,280
valid but super crappy source code

00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:34,280
control system

00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:36,560
CVS is a great pharmacy and a perfectly

00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,430
valid and not so terrible but not that

00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:46,130
great source code control system pardon

00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:49,130
fossils great fossil is a great source

00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:52,430
code control system get is a it's a

00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,870
great it is now but it hasn't been great

00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,660
for the whole time everybody said it was

00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:58,760
so flippin great the tooling sucked for

00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,560
years who thought that anybody thought

00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,870
that didn't wasn't true anybody was like

00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,730
I started using it the day that Lynch

00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:07,460
put down has been awesome since then

00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,510
with you're a liar it sucked for years

00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,970
you're a liar

00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:16,250
or stupid or delusional or or shut up

00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,630
so you want immutability source pig

00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,340
control can help you with immutability

00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,600
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,650
say that there are a lot of ways to

00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,340
handle them and some of them are better

00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:27,170
than others and for variances on the

00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,770
word better and your mileage may vary on

00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:32,720
all of that but immutable outcomes

00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,550
stored in a place that you can fetch

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:43,460
them by some identifier that is

00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:45,560
consistent never fail never and can I

00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,380
fail at that yes I could stop doing all

00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,880
the kind of national socialistic crazy

00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,980
stuff that I do to people one of their

00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,690
circumstances like the part where I go I

00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,250
am never deleting an item from this

00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,240
repository once it gets in there through

00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,530
the release process they're like well

00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,290
what if it's wrong I said then give me

00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:01,250
another one but what if it's got

00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,750
passwords in it and I go you should go

00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:10,190
change those right now cuz it's not

00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:14,600
coming out ever not ever pardon we'll

00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:15,890
let you do what well you can do all

00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,090
kinds of ways to trace them from get

00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,120
home I'm talking about an artifact

00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:23,120
repository source code control is a is a

00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,530
calculated lie who here is written

00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,830
history written history in a source

00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:30,010
coded system who is not

00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:31,870
that's what I thought you can do it in

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,640
almost any source code manager you can

00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,350
it's hunt it's actually harder to

00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:39,850
rewrite history and subversion but you

00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:42,070
could totally do it totally so the

00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:45,040
source code control is a calculated lie

00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:46,840
your artifact your outcome the place you

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,390
put that that thing needs to be

00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,340
immutable there are a couple of these

00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:54,010
there too a double handful of them there

00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:56,110
are - there's artifactory in some and

00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:59,590
Nexus and then there's all the rest of

00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:03,130
the trash Jim in a box that's a real one

00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:05,290
it's trash go get a go go get a real one

00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:07,600
that lets you decide whether it's

00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:09,160
possible to override an artifact it's

00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,070
like got a little click box and you say

00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,920
allows redeploy and you go nope

00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:16,810
and then when you write one you'll never

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,150
write it again because that thing will

00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:21,700
be like nope no it's backed by a source

00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,560
code or by storage and in a database and

00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,060
all that stuff sure if you have the keys

00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,790
to the kingdom and the capacity to do so

00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,610
you could certainly go remove it don't

00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:35,290
do that so tags are a pretty easy way to

00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:37,810
talk about things they're volatile and

00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:40,720
get and mercurial but not necessarily so

00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:43,090
much in subversion they let you talk

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,360
about specific points in time and they

00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,040
people who don't talk tagged their code

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,720
neatest firm talking-to in my opinion

00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,030
especially if you've decided you made a

00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,970
release maybe your release is the tag

00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:57,660
maybe there's no artifact there's an

00:51:54,970 --> 00:52:02,130
artifact but maybe there's not there is

00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:07,200
but at the very least make it tag people

00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:09,580
so you got containers anybody here like

00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,900
living in the 21st century and actually

00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:17,080
use containers at some part of their

00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:21,580
life ever so have a lot of feels about

00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:23,950
those things I I liked them in the

00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,480
beginning I hated them immediately after

00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:29,260
I liked them again and then I hated them

00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,120
again and then now I'm just like now I'm

00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,640
all confused and I'm wondering if maybe

00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:37,190
I'm just like I'm just like I just don't

00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:40,549
know but the truth and pardon

00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:47,619
it's like love or hate which is the same

00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:51,049
thing so containers are this really cool

00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:53,599
artifact you build a container the

00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:55,369
output of that is an artifact who here

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,740
recognizes that their container registry

00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:00,980
is their artifact repository for their

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,740
containers everybody I don't care if you

00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:06,920
didn't now you do so you do that's the

00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,299
thing it's that's what that is they're

00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,829
easily deployed and they're okay to

00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:11,359
figure and they are a giant pain in the

00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:13,880
butt to maintain if you think that's not

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,250
true well I've pity you at certain

00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,869
levels who here actually just takes

00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:21,710
their containers from their developers

00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:23,000
and runs what's given to them stop that

00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,289
crap if that's what you do if you were

00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,710
just too embarrassed to say that which

00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:30,230
you totally should be stop that

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:35,200
right now you go build that thing

00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:37,759
yourself developer I already did that

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,500
who here knows a developer has ever told

00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:44,690
a falsehood to them ever I have I have

00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,940
lied straight-up lied to my operations

00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:50,299
people they're like no I totally around

00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,369
those time so yeah you got to get you

00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:55,220
got to get to the place where you can

00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:57,890
assert things about this deterministic

00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:01,220
outcomes are the things you assert about

00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:04,630
your situation they're getting better

00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:06,829
everybody knows this it's not news

00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,569
kubernetes won the container

00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:10,670
orchestration wars if you aren't aware

00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:12,289
of that it's done it's over

00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:15,259
the conversations verb ask we're going

00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:17,000
on the next conversation if you're in a

00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:18,319
brownfield arrangement managing a

00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,480
deployment can be kind of challenging

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,690
it's getting a lot better

00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,039
and then there's external management

00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,359
systems that you occasionally have to

00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,269
deal with you might have heard of this

00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:30,829
thing that Amazon does called AWS that's

00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:33,650
just an external platform you got to

00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:36,680
deal with sometimes it changes who here

00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:39,740
used to use Google Reader who doesn't

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:42,289
who loses Google Reader now why is that

00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,539
because Google does not love you but

00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:46,759
they're their cloud that was pretty damn

00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:48,890
good and they don't just snatch stuff

00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:50,299
away from it so there's things you can

00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,020
use under these circumstances cloud

00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:53,750
formations

00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,790
great tool Torah forms great tool these

00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,260
are like marriage though you they tend

00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,880
to be once you start using cloud

00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,370
formations you don't you don't get away

00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,380
from it too hard it's like it's a little

00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,590
bit like you start getting legally bound

00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:13,850
to them you could also do your own this

00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:16,520
is what I did and it always works for

00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,110
you you can guarantee it because you

00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,080
just changed the criteria for success

00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:23,330
remember I didn't I I succeed 100% of

00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:28,040
the time by changing the definition of

00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:31,070
success and now it's like marriage

00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:35,870
except for this one thing you are

00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:39,770
married to a monster never do this do

00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:43,310
not under any circumstances start

00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:45,230
building an external management system

00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:47,290
for your artifact man if you're for your

00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,940
artifact deploys please don't do that

00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:51,350
and I do I write a bunch of tools for

00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,050
building things like images and

00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:55,670
containers and packages of stuff that's

00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:57,650
a little different it's not exactly

00:55:55,670 --> 00:56:00,500
different because it's a monster and

00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:02,600
once a human being uses it they now own

00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:05,660
your time a little bit and if that human

00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,550
being is you you got nobody to blame so

00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,200
you don't want the responsibility or the

00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:10,760
authority and the business always wants

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,760
the accountability and say you take it

00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,160
away and you give it to a robot who here

00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:20,450
has an automated release cycle where

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:23,990
they can say I want you mr. robot mr.

00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:25,820
Roboto domo arigato I want you to

00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:29,660
release this hash of this source code

00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:31,460
repository who has that 1 2 3 4

00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:36,620
does it work every time the same way

00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:39,230
every time well then you don't if the

00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,750
answer is no you don't if the variances

00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:43,580
are things like whoopsie you know you

00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:45,170
had a developer the hose something up

00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,570
yeah that's different I'm talking about

00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:49,310
under the happy path is not the same

00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,050
every time then you really don't have

00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:54,950
that you got something close and it's

00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:58,610
better than nothing but man once I had

00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:01,430
that see above INRI I've had a thousand

00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:03,290
on that because I just say hey you're

00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,970
gonna run the the release process is

00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:06,710
going to be fed through that robot

00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:10,250
no you can't touch it while it's running

00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:12,620
if it fails what you failed figure out

00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:15,290
why it failed well you should probably

00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:18,920
do that differently then yeah you can

00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:21,350
submit it again yeah absolutely

00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,240
I'll help you with that but you're gonna

00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:26,270
do it the way the robot wants it and the

00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:30,310
robot can't be ultimately flexible

00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:33,800
who here has more than one build

00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:35,900
workflow for in the same team if a team

00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,330
they build like eleven things and they

00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:41,810
have like three build tools for the same

00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:43,400
type of thing in a room this size with

00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:46,790
this many people the answer is always at

00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,120
least one why oh the developers want to

00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:51,890
do that well who cares what they want

00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,350
their job is to deliver value to the

00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:56,300
customer that's their whole job and the

00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:57,890
best way to do that is kind of

00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,450
Conformity oh well their tool is a

00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:01,190
little better for them I can take care

00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:03,170
of that much so when you hand

00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:06,320
responsibility over it to the to a

00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:08,810
critter you get to sit you get to just

00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:11,840
pass that off oh lease process just told

00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:14,960
you no sorry bro just didn't work yeah

00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,610
that's sad who's that so they get

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,140
developed like code definitely anything

00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,580
else so remember your robot is basically

00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:23,420
the same as the rest of your code now

00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,150
stagnation is not what immutability

00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,100
means it's just repeatable over time and

00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,500
the results are always acquirable patent

00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,820
from the past into the future you got to

00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,230
make it stable it if it needs to change

00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,000
guy replace it but you replace it with

00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:38,420
version of the thing the next version of

00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,010
the thing so as you replace old versions

00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,120
you of the new version and use semantic

00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:44,180
versions because you're not an animal

00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,920
and the namespaces work as a view into

00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,420
the functionality so if I know that

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,580
semantic version works and I know you're

00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,010
replacing 102 with one two three I know

00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,480
I can just do that because everything

00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:55,430
that depended on one dodo 2 is by

00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,790
definition of the merging binary

00:58:55,430 --> 00:59:01,780
compatible so give yourself good

00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,780
