Title: Mykel Alvis - Developing for Deterministic Deliveries, the live version

The craft of producing quality software doesnâ€™t happen accidentally. Decades of engineering efforts, primarily in the manufacturing arena, have given us advice on producing repeatable, reliable outcomes.

The practice of engineering the processes of a development effort are often ad hoc. While that can clearly work well for trivial things, it tends to be under-clubbed for larger efforts. Likewise, intense process with constant updates and schedules is equally impossible to deal with. This talk will demonstrate an execution of the results of years of effort toward producing a workable middle ground, with smoother and more repeatable delivery.  

Note that some percentage of this talk will be live demonstration. So...no nets and  conference wifi.
