Teaser:
 Your managers dream has finally come true: Rancher kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD, configuration management, microservices dev cluster, on demo hardware, all without a single consultant.... in a container the size of two shoes, for less than a few pairs of Air Jordans.

Synopsis:
 Cheap DevOps CI/CD Kubernetes cluster in a box (or two) on your desk. Based on cost effective ARM single board computers that can be easily extended on the cheap. This development cluster allows an organization on a small hardware procurement (cheaper than a laptop) to have their multi-agent cluster without the need of a data center or monthly cloud provider bill.
 Buzz words will abound, but this real world solution will be live and replicable without a PhD in hybrid network convergent clusterological automated cloud development operations with immediate angelic ROI. A manager will now have a real world thing to point to when an organization says DevOps while trying to define it. An engineer can get hands on with bare metal that can help with deploying to local or cloud data centers. A team will actually understand the systems behind the magic of microservice development, deployment, and infrastructure to be developed in a supported air-gap capable environment. 
 For companies with an existing kubernetes deployment, this BuzzCrate can allow benchmarking of solutions to ensure strategies deployed elsewhere perform as expected, and their providers.  Every part of a deployment from development, benchmarking, QA, general architecture, ingress, and security can be done on separately for a cost less than what is required for capital expenditure.
