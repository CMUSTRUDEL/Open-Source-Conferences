Title: Dave Stokes - How Do You Get Your Book Published?

Description: 
	SouthEast Linux Fest 2019
So you want to write a book about an open source topic? Seeking fame, fortune, groupies, or something else? Well, buddy, you picked the wrong alternative universe.  This talk is about how I wrote the highly popular but not exactly profitable 'MySQL & JSON - A Practical Programming Guide', the mistakes I made, the mistakes the editor made (idempotent != impotent), the process I used to write the book, the process a sane person should use to write a book, and how the results leave me with a less than Kardashian Level Life style.  So if you have the urge to write a technical book or just want to laugh at me, this is your opportunity.

I've been writing for longer than that

00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,950
but I want to talk about the first book

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,360
I actually got printed out in some sort

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,980
of a covered form and I'm mainly gonna

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,890
be talking today about technical books

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,020
hopefully on open source software if you

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,150
want to talk about mystery novels I have

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,740
one that I have 80% done that I'm trying

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,630
to finish if you want to talk about

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,400
romance novels I have a contact for you

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,560
I have a friend in grad school who as a

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,890
jokes in the book into Harlequin and

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,180
ended up with a five book series and has

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,550
gone on from there and hasn't looked

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,579
back so as I said earlier this is a book

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,800
on getting a something you're interested

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,660
in the open source community into some

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,280
sort of book format and getting it out

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,440
into the hands of others this is

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,180
wonderful the open source community

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,969
because we need to share information we

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,850
don't really have any big corporate

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,270
sugar daddies for the most part pushing

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,309
open source and how to use it easily and

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:07,830
this is a way to spread your information

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:10,110
that you have so why write a book well

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,450
no better way to find out how much you

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,170
do not know about a subject than trying

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,170
to write about it

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,490
writing is teaching by the way the only

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,080
person I know who does fairly well on

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,360
publishing technical books is Rasmus Lew

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,450
Dorf why because he wrote the original

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,119
PHP book or at least on the contract it

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,920
said for every time the book is

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,189
translated into their language you get a

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,110
X thousand dollar check by the way or

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,759
Riley has changed their there's their

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,790
standards in their contract on that I

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,149
think the PHP books been translated 23

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,770
24 different languages so and you

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,329
something what they let the fabled

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,020
number is it's really not that big of a

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,119
paycheck but it's rather nice to know

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,149
that some folks do get some money also

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,009
it's a a little bit of Fame your family

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,090
will be impressed I was very shocked at

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,399
my sister actually went out and bought

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,629
my book off the Amazon

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,790
there's no groupies unfortunately so I

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,350
know it's gonna be a devious plan rather

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,390
it's also very impressive

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,640
- on your resume that you wrote a book

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,900
that you actually have something I've

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,220
also been warned that you'll go on an

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,810
interview and someone argue about your

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,040
technology are talking about and they

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,360
will have a copy of your book on the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,400
shelf and they'll tell you that this guy

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,100
who wrote this book knows everything and

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,340
you know nothing Jon Snow okay the idea

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,260
what are you writing about two years ago

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,480
I was sending an airport and looking at

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,490
the documentation the MySQL had on one

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,140
of our new features and was obviously

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,090
the documentation was lifted from the

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,860
engineers work logs I don't know how

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,470
many of you read engineer work logs for

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,460
major software projects but there is

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,290
about as comprehensible as VCR

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,600
instruction is that you got with VCRs

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,370
from Japan in the 1970s before they

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,020
really actually hired people to who had

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,960
English writing skills to actually tell

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,060
you how to use your VCR there wasn't as

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,180
concise didn't have a lot of examples

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,280
and I thought our our stuff was lacking

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,280
so I decided to start writing notes and

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,440
it turned into a book now you basically

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,360
have two options the first one is go

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,600
ahead plunge in start writing your own

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,510
book that's what I did was my first book

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,310
and it's not what I recommend why did I

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,080
do that I did it that way because I

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,740
wasn't sure I had an imperial for a book

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:40,530
and as my book ended up fairly thin at

00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:42,780
just over 120 pages you could also write

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,600
a book proposal there are lots of

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,370
publishers out there looking for content

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,870
I won't mention all of them but I'm

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,470
going to mention a couple that I like

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,030
and there's other ones out there that

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,230
may have different reputations may have

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,330
slightly better deals but it's all

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,520
roughly the same process so you

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,150
basically have two options and

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,220
ironically if you do decide to write the

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,670
book first I recommend that you do go

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,620
through and write your own book proposal

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:14,550
all reputable publishers will have some

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,150
sort of guide that they want and it's a

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,380
good way to make sure that you have a

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,810
checklist to get everything you want

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,700
done done and if you are following

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,280
a the guide for a publisher make sure

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,810
you read it make sure you follow it got

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,060
a remember these folks aren't usually

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,860
highly technical but they know they're

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,380
English so they will catch spelling

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,470
mistakes make sure your gerund phrases

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:41,680
match they will catch grammar mistakes

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,600
which is good and bad a lot of times

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,950
they'll correct them for you so if your

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,250
English skills are not all that

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,200
wonderful they could help you out there

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:55,090
but they don't know your tech and they

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:58,900
can't help you there now a pressbooks

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,419
I'm going to use them an example I don't

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,120
write it for them I've talked to writing

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:06,460
for them but I like their process they

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,020
actually have a guide out there and they

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:13,419
say okay in your in your submission to

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,390
us what's the main title of your book is

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:22,630
there a subtitle they and to do

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,610
introducing or master or expert and then

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,900
they lo on a tag line and I'll pass this

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,470
one around if anyone wants a copy this

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,669
book dr. Bella's has graciously

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,780
dedicated but they have a tag line that

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:42,039
they want to use on the bottom of the

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:43,120
book author data dater dater data every

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,289
author if you're running with someone

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,850
else you're going to want to submit this

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,650
for them they won't know who you are

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,460
what your background is you don't have

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,910
to have an extensive background

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,860
sometimes you'll find out that someone

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,560
who has two years as kubernetes has been

00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,110
added a long time someone who's been

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,190
writing C four for 15 years might still

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:05,530
be a relative newcomer so make sure you

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,940
give your detail and make sure you give

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,910
them your full name your mailing address

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,340
phone number and email address I have a

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,130
friend who's a screenwriter in Hollywood

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:18,640
best script he ever saw I wanted option

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:22,930
it no return address on the envelope no

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,270
name no title but it was a great script

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,789
and they had no one offered to so they

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,169
had to throw it away

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,780
next they want a description they're

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,390
gonna want three to four paragraphs on

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,369
what the book does why are you writing

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,869
this who's the audience

00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:39,869
why does this matter

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,189
share everything you think would be

00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:47,709
helpful like if you're writing a book on

00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,939
kubernetes they don't know the text so

00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,639
you have to tell them what kubernetes is

00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:57,069
what it does what it's replacing how it

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,959
helps people unique selling points what

00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,359
is unique about your book what is the

00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,249
gotcha that someone walking through a

00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:08,949
bookstore or looking through Amazon will

00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:10,689
say AHA that's why I need this book what

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,679
readers will learn what are you trying

00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:16,779
to teach in this book if you're doing a

00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:20,439
intro to bash shell you're not going to

00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:22,329
set up a entire section on DevOps and

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,979
how to keep your CI system working

00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:26,739
you're going to do more basics more

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,479
concepts if you're doing a book on

00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:31,749
advanced DevOps you probably don't want

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,089
to do a lot of bash scripting source

00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:35,979
code does your book contain source code

00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,199
or other ancillary materials useful to

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:40,329
reader are you going to have a github

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,979
repository where can download samples

00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:46,839
where they can get the code I also

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,539
mentioned something later if you have

00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,949
code in your book make sure you keep a

00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,989
separate copy somewhere often a github

00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,489
repository or Dropbox I like that

00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:56,739
because you'll have a technical editor

00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,509
it will need to proof your code and it's

00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,789
much nicer to keep them from cutting and

00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:05,739
pasting from the source or from your

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:08,349
source document your manual audience who

00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:10,599
are you writing this book for are you

00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:12,789
running for someone who's learning the

00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,129
program someone who's been developing

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,479
over two to three years someone who's

00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,809
very experienced but doesn't know

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,879
whatever you're teaching about helps to

00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:23,860
have a specific audience and it helps to

00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,219
have an idea rightly roughly when you're

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,509
writing who's gonna be reading the book

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,339
earlier this year I taught an intro to

00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,269
MySQL class to a bunch of young ladies

00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,990
for Austin

00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:37,449
Austin's chick tech a bunch of 14 year

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,879
old 18 year old females have a lot

00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:42,550
different perspective and knowledge base

00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,589
than you folks I can talk about database

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,389
normalization or data normalization and

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,879
I expect a fair amount of you will have

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:50,060
a rough idea what that is they had no

00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,490
idea what I meant

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,070
between integers and alphanumeric so I

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,270
had to scale back my presentation to

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,560
cover that level of information also if

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,920
you can have a secondary audience the

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,630
tertiary audience put that in there

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,210
oh by the way I just learned the

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,770
Department of Education is going off and

00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:15,440
using Gentoo Linux so right there

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,390
there's 40,000 extra million copies that

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,440
you could sell to that audience and I

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,730
don't know if that's true about the

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,570
Department of Education or anything like

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:28,100
that but make up some like that

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:29,360
competition what other books on the

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,710
subject matter you're running are out

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,020
there others you know that's coming out

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,120
there if you're writing a book on pearl

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:42,440
house you compared to what Larry wall is

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,970
put out in the past if you're if you're

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,610
basically covering the same territory

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,180
that another author has covered for that

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,470
publisher they may not want it I wanted

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,110
to write a book on common table

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,730
expressions and a present to touch it

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,520
because they already had a book on

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,839
common table expressions what if I would

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,839
it would much better but oh well

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,720
estimated page count or word count how

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,220
big do you expect this book to be got I

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,080
remember at one point for most these

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,030
books we are killing trees and they want

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,450
to make sure that you know there's an

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,100
investment there that it it does okay

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,580
estimated schedule and this is where

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,660
everyone blows it on their first book

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,370
can you give us an idea when you expect

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,200
to be completed first two chapters of

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,790
the book oh you did the first two

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,470
chapters in a month and it's gonna be 20

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,020
chapters long so let's see that's 10

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,400
months to write no no it doesn't work

00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,170
that way

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,610
first two chapters of a book are usually

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,430
the easiest because you're doing

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,589
introductions material you're you're

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,480
kind of doing a synopsis of what's going

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:46,430
to come on that's the easiest stuff to

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,770
write things get more technical things

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:53,740
bogged down they get slower and you run

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,760
into other problems rough out the book a

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,330
press says go ahead and put out the

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,870
chapter name chapter content goal first

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,580
level heading and then

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,610
go chapter goal subheading subheading

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,960
subheading and fill in that there are

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,490
other guides out there that will tell

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,860
you to outline everything in your book

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,480
and then go back and take the major

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,370
bullet points for all the outlines and

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,950
make those your chapters and fill in

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:25,010
from there I don't know a lot of folks

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:27,140
who write that way I tend to write two

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,150
or three subheadings and then write the

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,650
the major heading above that and then

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,290
put in filler material and the next day

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,340
I know I have 20 pages for a chapter

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:38,870
everyone has their own separate writing

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,760
style now manning publications is

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,360
similar to a press where they want you

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,040
to define what are the minimum minimum

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,480
qualifications for someone to buy your

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,910
book read it and understand and be able

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,130
to use it this means you have to have a

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,110
rough idea what your audience is like by

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,130
the way shows like this you're talking

00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:00,290
to folks and you're yah

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,650
what you're doing is a great way to kind

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:06,620
of test proof level for your book so if

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:09,140
you're here talking like Jim might be

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,700
talking about fire bombing your hardware

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,500
to make sure that it's appropriate how

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,600
you run those tests and all that that

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,740
would be a wonderful book but if he

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,960
doesn't know how many people in the

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,730
audience know the basis of how he's

00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,990
doing that he can kind of get a good

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,900
judge of it by talking to folks also

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,110
they want you to be fairly specific is

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,010
it general knowledge or is that some of

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,530
no hands-on

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,600
do they have programming skills of some

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,100
level what if they have programming

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,960
skills but nothing in functional program

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:43,550
they don't understand all that lambda

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,680
calculus stuff who's your audience also

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,230
what's the typical job role for your

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,690
primary reader four years experience as

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:55,250
a front-end engineer entry level system

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,630
admin or why does someone want to buy

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,040
this book do they want to learn

00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,940
kubernetes because they here's the hot

00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,300
thing and they're looking for another

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,630
job

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:06,500
how do you find your audience and how do

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:09,040
you shoehorn them into your book next

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,630
thing if you are not self-employed you

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,560
have to check with your boss what are

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,510
the writing rules what do they expect

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,850
do they have to review everything does

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,410
your boss have to review it when your

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,260
senior engineers have to review it and

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,930
then legal gets a pass at it

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,190
it depends what are the writing rules

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,370
are you allowed to use your equipment

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:36,490
from work are you allowed to do this on

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:38,980
work time also they might want a bit of

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,860
the very tiny bit of pie that you're

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,450
going to get maybe they want to share

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,000
your royalties but you have to have that

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,510
all dedicated up in front now I work for

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,649
Oracle and as you all are well aware

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:54,070
Oracle believes in hiring as many

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,450
lawyers as they can so we have a process

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,029
where you tell them what you're doing

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,560
and who you're doing it for I was lucky

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:04,839
I was writing for the Oracle press which

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:08,230
was at them a printer for a major

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,270
publishing house they've since changed

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,279
that but they had a process where they

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:16,360
can go through and say okay you can use

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,709
the logo you can use the trademark we'll

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,810
do a little bit promotion here you

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,550
little bit of motion there but they had

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:28,060
it all sussed out so they know who is

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:29,800
doing went into whom so once you get

00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,650
your proposal written up what I

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,850
recommend you do is go out someplace

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,200
where no one will hear you with a hard

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,260
copy of it and read it out loud to

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,700
yourself when you got done cringing go

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,900
back and rewrite the stuff that made you

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,370
cringe print it again and try it again

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,870
to get to a point where it doesn't

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,339
actually make you crawl it just if you

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:55,180
haven't done the surfing before it's

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:56,829
very easy to to frustrate yourself but

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
once you get to where you'll really like

00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,520
it

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,760
spellcheck it have someone else in your

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,230
family or a friend who at least passed

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,800
an English class sometime in their life

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,529
read through it and then you're going to

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,320
send your your proposal off to the

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,209
company and make sure you CC yourself

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,820
with a copy one is it gives you a time

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:23,680
stamp and B it also lets you remember

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,640
later what you actually promised now I

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,950
recommend that you

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,730
the book proposal route even if you're

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,870
gonna go with the self-publishing mainly

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,010
because it helps you layout the book

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:39,030
helps you not verbalize but actually lay

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:42,550
out what you want to do with it

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:44,830
now you can't self publish now the

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,370
caveat here is that in the past there's

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,270
been a lot of vanity publishers that

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,100
basically took your money and gave you a

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,390
marriage and if whatever you wrote and

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,610
they went happily along the way and

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,880
you've got a lot of money

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,860
also if you self publish from then on a

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,440
lot of the major publishing houses won't

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,770
trust you there oh he self-published

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,620
he's kind of slipped we really don't

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,650
want him on our imprint sure we he's a

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,030
self publisher he's not a serious author

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,710
they're all out folks out there if you

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,020
know Chris hearts just from the PHP

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,670
world he self publishers a lot of his

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,580
books and claims that's how he's paying

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:27,600
for his BMW but there are ways to do

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:29,830
that so many options this way you can

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,540
make your own PDFs from whatever you

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,390
want their vanity publishers out there

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,630
as I'm an amazon has Kindle direct

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,460
publishing where they will only take 30

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,110
percent of your royalties and let you

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,540
sell the rest for whatever you think the

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,510
market will bear they have their own

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:49,240
authoring software so you can download

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,560
that and use that the only thing they

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,230
want to know is your social security

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,870
number and the routing number and bank

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,840
account for your checking account so

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,150
very easy low entry barrier there if you

00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,329
want to do that and of course there's

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:06,760
other options out there there are other

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,610
minor publishers that will let you

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,770
self-publish but I'm trying to stick to

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:15,640
the the mainstream with the main

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,720
publishers actual writing yeah you still

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,360
have to do that after you written the

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:24,550
proposal if you're still not sick of the

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:28,800
idea you actually start writing so I use

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:31,810
an outline as a guide I like to go from

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,790
first line of the first chapter to the

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,330
last line of the rough chapter in kind

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,730
of a rough format and slug it out and

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,710
try to get down

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,260
85% of the ideas and then I go back and

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,299
tune and that is my my first draft I

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,549
know other folks who will actually do

00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,770
one complete perfect chapter before

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:54,850
going on to the next chapter that's not

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,620
me it might be you set up a a regular

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,899
place and a regular time and a regular

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,520
routine to do that one of my college

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:02,710
professors would get up every morning at

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,380
five o'clock and write for an hour why

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,940
is that well he was kind of an early

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,380
bird he'd been in the Marine Corps and

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
didn't really think that sleeping past

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,950
five o'clock was healthy for you and

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,840
also he had little children that woke up

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:19,659
promptly at 6:30 so set up a routine now

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,090
some days you're going to have better

00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,460
results than others it's like coding you

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,020
know some days you're hot and you're

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,460
you're coding away and it goes great

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,230
next thing you know it's 10:30 at night

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,510
and you've missed dinner but you're

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,820
happy because you've done it other days

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:38,350
you stare at the screen and go why did I

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:41,649
stop being a music major writings just

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,659
like that also do not self edit too much

00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:46,899
on the first pass get the main ideas out

00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:48,490
there rough it out lay down the the

00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:52,570
basic tracks and come back and add the

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,299
fills later as I mentioned earlier if

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,740
you have source code keep a separate

00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,149
copy it out there for your technical

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:04,289
editor I'll tell you what a technic

00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:06,250
letter is later Jeff setting software

00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,600
99% of the folks out there will tell you

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,909
they don't matter they don't care what

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,740
you use for text editing software as

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:16,450
long as it's Microsoft Word I wish I had

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,909
a better answer here I wish that they

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:24,909
use LibreOffice or anything else but

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:26,799
word is the default format and by the

00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:28,990
way if you're doing this for a book and

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,450
you're hoping to get some income it is a

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:37,990
tax write-off for you so keep that

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:39,730
receipt first-pass try to do a stream of

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,350
consciousness do your James Joyce best

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,340
put everything out there you think you

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,870
can do and more just let it all hang out

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,210
don't worry about typos if you're a bad

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,220
typist like I am just get it all out of

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,180
you make it a catharsis get everything

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:58,060
you can

00:19:52,180 --> 00:20:01,510
on that page second pass do obvious

00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,280
things hey I'm I'm I'm running about C

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,490
programming but why do I have all this

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,020
Python code in here can't do that make

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,600
sure you're what you're writing kind of

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,290
matches as close as you can to your

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:17,320
outline if you have doubts about the

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,590
readability read things out loud

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,140
there are rules and English that none of

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,590
us can verbalize but it's the proper way

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:29,950
of placing adverbs and adjectives before

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,270
a noun that you hear but you may not see

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,280
when you write it down without listening

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,580
to yourself if you don't speak a lot

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,700
while you type and as you're doing your

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,650
second pass this is we're gonna go yeah

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,020
but I forget to mention this section so

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,950
you start hammering more and more stuff

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:52,450
in there keep going keep adding to it

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:54,150
keep trying to bulk it up and after the

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,110
first pass may second pass

00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,750
double-checked your chapters follow the

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,220
outline did you need to update the

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,880
outline by the way that's an important

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,070
thing to do

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,900
so if you suddenly discover there's a

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,030
new version of your software it has five

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,190
new features put that in your outline

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,290
and write down information with five new

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,300
cheats features did you cover everything

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:16,810
in the proposal if you're writing a book

00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:19,510
for novice Java developers and you're

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:24,220
into the swing framework know you've

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:27,640
over scoped do your examples max match

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,890
the test text by the way it's the more

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,420
you have they're in this little more

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,280
redundancy you have and the more

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:38,020
examples you have to the point of being

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,570
painful the better that's what you have

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,360
on the page look right does it make

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,490
sense and then go out and do the grammar

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,060
checks do the spelling checks and go

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:52,120
once again read it out loud and

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,710
basically take a look at it does it look

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,480
right does it do what you want to do

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,480
does it say roughly what you want to say

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:05,460
now at some time you might actually want

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:08,240
to go out and hire a professional editor

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,820
they're doing the piworld my no Kyra

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,250
Sedgwick Ferguson she's now working for

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,350
PHP architect she made her living it

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,040
still makes her living as a professional

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,610
editor they will greatly improve what

00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,110
you write but they don't know your tech

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,210
so if you have something that you think

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,190
is technically proficient but it reads

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,080
like the back of a cereal box under

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,560
monosodium glutamate and all the other

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:37,980
preservatives hire an editor to smooth

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,990
out what you're writing now every editor

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,030
is different they might have different

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:46,260
processes they might want to see a

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:48,810
chapter up front they may not they want

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,280
to see the entire book if they happen to

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,680
know your subject matter even

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,450
tangentially or their husband's cousin

00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,760
actually touched a computer five years

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:00,900
before that helps it's a little bit of a

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,840
in with them they may do things like add

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,900
indexes or reformat your stuff but they

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,940
want your source code and make sure that

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,580
you discuss with them upfront what their

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:16,890
rate is per board per hour per page or

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:18,390
per project and get a contract and they

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,410
may want to see a running sample upfront

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:25,800
or they might want to see the entire

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:27,750
book upfront now the big publishing

00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,490
houses when you get ready to go to

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,040
auction assign you to editors one's

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,650
gonna be the person who does the chores

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,380
I saw there earlier where they go

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,500
through and make sure that the thing is

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,560
a cohesive compilation of your thoughts

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,710
that it's well formatted and well

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,790
spelled but for a technical book that

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,920
should give you a technical editor

00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,450
usually you can refer a friend of yours

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,150
hopefully it's someone who knows your

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,470
tech in my case I got my counterpart

00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:02,280
from Europe to go through all my

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:03,690
examples have them check your code ask

00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,350
them to run through whatever lint

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,240
program you have available for your code

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:12,930
once again keep it a separate copy for

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,130
for them to a cut and paste and it's one

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,560
of those things where they might come

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,130
back and say you notice an example here

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,560
doesn't really type

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,090
I doesn't cut it the way I think you

00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,430
should do it it would be better if you

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,020
do it this way they are trying to help

00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,260
you make a better product don't keep

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,910
your ego in front of your goal make sure

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,830
that they if they give you to give good

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,680
constructive stuff to use it it's very

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,310
valuable and Manik Lee it's very cheap

00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,620
ok once again

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:44,290
you're your editor your folks at the

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,080
publishing company they don't know a

00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:50,680
kubernetes from a Python from a Java

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,950
Script they know books they know English

00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,630
usually and they know spelling and often

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,490
they're very anal about that so double

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:02,110
check always double check your line

00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:04,590
language and spelling and what the

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,470
problems with technical subjects is

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,700
you'll be good way through and a new

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,490
feature will come out or a new version

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,620
will come out and something might be

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,410
deprecated or more cases something's

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,510
added to it and you'll have to adjust

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:37,660
some cases you're going to have to talk

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:39,100
to your editor about yeah yeah yes good

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,350
good I caught that just as it came up

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,520
but thank you for catching it too it's

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,350
one of the things we're we're in a

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,880
community where all everything under our

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:52,500
feet is constantly shifting so make sure

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:56,110
that you're you're up on your tech so

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,480
you finally have everything finished you

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:01,120
think you've got the final version out

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,770
to the editors they're coming back and

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,230
they're fairly happy too they're making

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,520
minor revisions and they're doing a

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,650
little grammar checks and coming back

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,060
you with double check this paragraph

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,800
does this read the way you want and

00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:17,440
sometimes it does and sometimes you want

00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:19,690
to change it and this is where the hard

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,000
work yes this is your on the finish line

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,970
but it's all uphill into the snow past

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,980
Mount Everest you have to review

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,540
everything chapter by chapter go through

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,600
all the illustrations go through all the

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,820
source code

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,820
and it is tedious but you're almost

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:38,900
there so final editor will probably

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,240
you'll probably pair with someone who

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,340
knows the company's processes they know

00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,470
how to get things from what you plan to

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,190
them into pre-press actually under the

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,270
printing press and into the warehouse

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,460
they probably work with a lot of authors

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,830
they probably have 32 working on any one

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,300
time if not more and they're in a hurry

00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,240
and they may not have a lot of time to

00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,000
spend with you so do not abuse their

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,720
time and take any suggestions they have

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,870
hardly also they once again have no clue

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,890
on your subject so they don't know your

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:16,210
tech and by the way double check their

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,210
work I didn't do that

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:25,520
I was using the word idempotent to say

00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,300
that if you want a string of data to

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,650
come out in the same format you put in

00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,480
rather than using the MySQL JSON

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:36,470
document type which will organize it and

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,390
sort it by the key value pair use the

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,340
string so it goes in the same way it

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:45,980
comes out item potent guess what word

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:50,680
bingo and that was the big hit I'm the

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,680
MySQL Twitter feed for a couple of days

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,920
yep

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,930
it was special and that was kind of

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,820
embarrassing and since the publishing

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,920
house has changed for the Oracle press

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,510
there's no way I'm going to do a second

00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,600
edition or be able to go back and revise

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:10,250
that in future editions so whatever

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,080
civilization digs of our civilization

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,910
twenty thousand years from now they're

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,150
gonna read that book and go did he

00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:21,620
really mean to stay idempotent instead

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:24,350
of important once again Technic letter

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,640
you may be assigned one hopefully

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,070
they'll ask you if you have a friend who

00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,590
can do it I was lucky that Fred to shot

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,900
my counterpart from Brussels was able to

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:36,590
do that and I don't know how much they

00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,240
paid him but it was probably a couple

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,330
hundred bucks at most and he put in a

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,460
lot of work and once again if they're

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,660
anal retentive

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,140
really helps and they will have

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:50,860
suggestions that will help your book so

00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,090
final hand off you have electronic forms

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,770
you probably sign saying you know this

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,370
is this is the book as promised it's

00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,780
finally delivered boom in your contract

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:03,790
you will have written out what your

00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:05,050
rights are in you've probably all heard

00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,630
the stories about the rock stars in the

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:10,270
50s or Solomon Lindo who wrote the lion

00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,920
sleeps tonight who basically got ripped

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,750
off of millions if not billions of

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,460
dollars because the contracts were

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,620
changed they were moved around all that

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,000
and he wasn't really promised any

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,560
publishing rights your contract will say

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,990
after you hand it off how soon they have

00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,690
to have it out they might have a down

00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,670
payment on royalties or a draw on

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,640
royalties they'll send you and you'll

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,110
have a rough idea contractually after

00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,700
you turn it off how soon you'll be able

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:41,920
to see your book by the way major

00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,050
publisher will go out and get an ISBN

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,520
number you can actually get these

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,720
yourself but it helps to have the

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,770
publisher do that because they go out

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,810
and get a whole block of them and

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,340
they're east to doing it the paperwork

00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,320
is not that onerous but if you're a

00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:58,330
techie it's something you don't used to

00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,670
doing logos once again MySQL has a logo

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,170
that's trademarked by Oracle and I had

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,030
to have that double-checked

00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,280
I helped him have me working for the

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,430
Oracle press double-checked the graphics

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,540
if you have graphs and charts you want

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,160
to make sure you have the right graphs

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,450
and charts at the right time in the

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:18,160
right place and then copyrights make

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,820
sure your book is copyrighted if it's

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,560
not someone makes one change to it

00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:27,720
becomes a derivative work and now they

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:30,880
basically own your work it's real nasty

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,970
so I started writing this book while

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,470
sitting in airports waiting for flights

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,350
during flight cancellations because I

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,360
didn't like the documentation we had and

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:43,300
a little bit after a year ice after I

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:48,100
started I got a box from mcgraw-hill

00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:50,200
with 20 copies of my book and I was very

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,330
excited to see it pop up on Amazon and

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,790
you see little notices on Amazon almost

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,980
out of stock order yours today being

00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:02,039
reordered

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:03,269
back in stock very exciting and now 20

00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,139
years ago you could go blip Barnes and

00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,549
Noble's and they had a big computer

00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:07,320
section you can see your book very

00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:09,090
rarely do you now see Tec new technical

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,779
books at Barnes Noble so I know I'll

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:15,380
never see that but it's also very fun to

00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:17,820
actually have your real copy in hand and

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,169
it's also real fun to be able to tell

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:24,059
your friends oh yeah you can download my

00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:26,190
book at Amazon by the way I'll be giving

00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,620
away a copy of my book at 4 o'clock on a

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,539
talk on the masculine JSON data type for

00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:36,620
those who are interested and with that

00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:36,620
what inputs do you all have yes sir

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,680
yeah your your editors will tell you

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,810
what they want and also have you sign a

00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,460
release for every photograph claim where

00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,470
you claim that that is my original work

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,870
that's my photograph I'm not cribbing it

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,510
from somebody else the folks I know

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,490
who've done stuff with pictures say it's

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,530
fairly straightforward major publishing

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,550
houses have worked for doing that if

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,960
you're self-publishing

00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,370
I would document when you took the

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,140
picture where and how with what

00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:15,090
equipment and note that down someplace

00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,140
in your book notes so that if someone

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:20,750
ever comes back to you and said hey

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:23,340
that's actually my picture right now in

00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,140
Texas there's a nasty lawsuit there's a

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,690
gentleman who took a picture of downtown

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,080
Houston and put his watermark on there

00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,210
University of Houston took his watermark

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,430
off the picture and used it on their

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:40,470
their recruitment posters and their

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:42,450
catalogs and he sued and right as of

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:44,610
last week he was told by the state

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,260
judges that you'd have no rights to your

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,610
own work so it's going to Supreme Court

00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm sure the Supreme Court is going to

00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:54,210
reverse that so save yourself heartache

00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,650
and effort make sure it's original photo

00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,330
make sure you document it when you took

00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,470
it and how you took it and keep that in

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:06,960
your notes just in case it ever

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:09,650
boomerangs on you okay

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,650
great thing

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,320
yeah and I've been told the worst thing

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,820
you can have happen is have your

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,900
photograph turn into a meme that comes

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,300
extremely popular

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,970
that's scatological about someone that

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:40,270
you really don't care about and you keep

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:40,270
getting it sent to you yes sir yeah

00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,380
your book may have nothing to do with

00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,150
your work but guess what

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,670
your employment contract may say that

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,400
every output from you is belongs to your

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,680
boss years ago I was working you for

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,630
defense contractor I wrote my contract

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,430
that I have several projects on the side

00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,260
I was working in bands I was writing on

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,600
a movie script and I said I want these

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,880
excluded from the contract and they

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,030
almost didn't hire me they hadn't been

00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,409
in dire need of some Linux help or a

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,240
UNIX help they wouldn't have hired me

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:19,419
but some of those things were they can

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,250
actually claim you're our employee your

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:23,820
contract with us says that we own all

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,820
your output

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,950
yeah yeah I see stuff like that puttin

00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,170
cookbooks I've also seen I've also seen

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,910
websites for a guy says you know for my

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,260
25 years of playing with see these are

00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:03,160
the things I found and here's my referee

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:05,780
point points forum the other thing is I

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,579
have a friend who routinely has

00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,660
bookmarks that I would give my right arm

00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:10,099
for and I say okay what are you

00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,750
discovering the past six months because

00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:17,390
he finds all these wonderful crazy

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:20,000
little things out there that one was

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,619
actually a piece of Postgres trivia that

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,030
was very valuable for me because I was

00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,950
working on something that when my skill

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,030
was doing in that arena and it's one of

00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,770
those things where I knew we had the

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,799
bookmark but he had to go through like

00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,059
5,000 bookmarks to find that one so it

00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:33,530
helps to have your own little web page

00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,849
even if it's on your own server where

00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,000
you know that is and then try to share

00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:37,000
that

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,299
you know we'll have the value of a show

00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,460
like this it's the hallway track someone

00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:01,680
will say hey I don't know how I'm doing

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,910
this but it how does anyone else do it

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,260
someone else member brilliant idea and

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,750
I'll say no that's rubbish what you want

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,130
is you want this and they'll hand you a

00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:32,760
drive with their code on there and it

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:34,410
does work and it's so information you

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,829
can write that in a media with the

00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:42,750
instance you can also if you prefer you

00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:45,059
can go to stack exchange and just go

00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,730
through everything step by step with

00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:49,710
screenshots the tools are there it's

00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,730
definitely changed to make it really

00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,230
really good you know beginning to end

00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,849
all the things you'd be like this is my

00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,339
question and I'm answering my question

00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:01,380
I'm done with that you can get karma at

00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:05,029
Stack Exchange for that or like I said

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,029
you just go to the media wiki instance

00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,950
well you do get out of it if you do you

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,140
know throw Commedia with the incidence

00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,250
on your own server or you know answer a

00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,560
ton of questions on Stack Exchange

00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:32,440
whether it's an Seng answering ones that

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,210
people ask or whether it's answering

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,369
your home to ask questions to get the

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,530
good thing out there either way if you

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:40,180
do it right you tie your real name to it

00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:42,010
and eventually that does start a bear

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,740
fruit you get people contacting you and

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:48,340
wanting consulting you know you can put

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:51,190
up a patreon link and give that like

00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:54,100
this is what I did starting about 10 or

00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:56,770
15 years ago I made freebsd wiki and

00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,720
then went to wiki and neither one paid

00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,430
being done directly but that's all been

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,040
part of the process to get me the point

00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:06,130
where when you google Jim Salter right

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,440
now I'd like the top 3 results despite

00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,609
there being an AP reporter whose crap

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,040
it's published in the newspaper

00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:14,410
every single day also named Jim Salter

00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,330
and that eventually turns into you know

00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,730
you can actually take your career that

00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,710
the other option is I don't know how

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,830
many you know Adam Colt used to work for

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,859
rogue wave with the Zen framework and he

00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:29,140
runs sunshine PHP he started doing a

00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,300
little YouTube videos on running

00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,910
Composer with PHP and other little

00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,350
things and he was looking for another

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,990
job it helped get him a job as a

00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,970
developer relations specialist and it's

00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:44,430
one of those things were maybe two

00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:46,450
minutes on YouTube here wiki page here

00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:49,090
like he said go out to Stack Exchange

00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:54,550
not stock / Stack Overflow please Stack

00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:56,440
Overflow is a nut house and having some

00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,410
crazy relatives I can tell you I do know

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,270
my knot houses but it's one of those

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:03,430
things if you're on share it put it on a

00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,650
webpage you run across them with answers

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,670
that oh this is over on here and the

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,900
great thing is you'll find someone who

00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,590
will argue with you actually have

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,310
something better you can put out there

00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:26,430
yes sir

00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:37,170
and we reluctantly yes I've seen I've

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:39,060
seen ya I've seen several of those I've

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,760
tried a couple of my didn't like them

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,440
mcgraw-hill had their own little plugins

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,470
they wanted to use that weren't too

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,530
obtrusive I have a friend who wrote two

00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:51,690
textbooks in tech that were English

00:40:49,530 --> 00:41:00,060
literature textbook so whatever you want

00:40:51,690 --> 00:41:01,830
to use you can use what I'll go here to

00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,180
the chapter where I I know I left off

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,880
and said okay what's the next bullet

00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,680
point I want to cover oh that reminds me

00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,450
I need to go back here and I need to do

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:16,910
this I have a very ADHD scattershot

00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:16,910
nothing didn't source for me

00:41:36,110 --> 00:42:23,220
yeah yeah they'll have their own

00:41:38,700 --> 00:42:24,510
invention yeah

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,680
and something I'm gonna go off the

00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,400
microphone around this so it won't get

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,400
on the recording

00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,380
not a hundred percent

00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:47,160
the problem usually is that people make

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:49,870
really sloppy what you really need to do

00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,780
you say all right my tools are I have

00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:55,780
heading 1 heading 2 heading 3 you know I

00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:58,810
used that consistently for check for

00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:01,240
head titles you know for subtitles

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,490
whatever those are basically the only

00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:07,590
three things I use and maybe I'll bold

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,590
or italicize something manually you know

00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:15,880
you can swap that format format you can

00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,280
do HTML you can do WordPress markup you

00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:33,370
can do Libre Office you can do Microsoft

00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:35,260
Word and it will come up fine for theirs

00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,000
in the history lookup sgml which is the

00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,860
process of HTML because they had all

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,090
these government contractors writing

00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,500
documentation they're all running

00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,330
different chapters the idea is if you

00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,250
keep to a heading one when we put

00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:49,560
everything back together we'll figure

00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,560
out what a heading one is so yes sir

00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:59,920
having worked for in a computer

00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,350
department run by mathematicians I can

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:21,490
concur that yeah it's not as glamorous

00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:25,150
as you make it sound yeah oh yeah maybe

00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:27,160
a couple academic presses Donald Knuth

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:31,390
would probably appreciate it but the

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,950
trouble is 99.999% no word they love

00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:36,970
word they're gonna want you to use word

00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:41,230
so as much as I love other program word

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:45,660
processing software it's kind of you're

00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,660
stuck that way yes sir

00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:19,420
yeah well that's that's that's where you

00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:22,390
go that's we're gonna work with your

00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:25,180
editor and you're cutting your your copy

00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:28,630
editor do you work with the UX design

00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,980
folks at all I I used to do I mainly did

00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:32,230
full stack stuff and then I started

00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,880
doing the lower half of the stack if you

00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,160
work with really good UX folks they'll

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,420
tell you code your page this way and

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,700
I'll make it look pretty I'll do all the

00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,260
CSS I'll do that just put it in this div

00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,140
and name it this and have this field all

00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:47,500
there don't worry what it looks like and

00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:48,609
it looks yeah and when the stuff that

00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,019
you used to debug looks absolutely

00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:51,849
nothing like the finished product and

00:46:50,019 --> 00:47:00,880
usually hopefully it looks better a few

00:46:51,849 --> 00:47:03,549
times it doesn't but yeah I've talked to

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,190
their vendors to buy books but I didn't

00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:08,650
go approach them about submitting a book

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,720
I was kind of lucky that I was working

00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,160
and still in working for Oracle the

00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,990
Oracle press folks were very receptive

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,460
to me I talked to them at Oracle

00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,809
OpenWorld and said I have this book it's

00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,549
half written would you be interested in

00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:21,190
seeing it I got a contact name sent it

00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:23,650
to her and surprisingly ten days later

00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:28,410
said yeah send us on more we really want

00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:28,410
to publish this so yes sir

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,190
yeah the to be honest with you I've

00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:48,600
talked to a press

00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:51,600
I talked to to someone who does the

00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,020
Kindle publishing stuff but I haven't

00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:58,620
talked to Manning I haven't talked to

00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:59,760
I'm tryin remember the other one yeah

00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,540
there's a whole bunch of them out there

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,530
that let me get the screen back up the

00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,060
good news is there's a whole bunch of

00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,060
folks out there looking for content and

00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,330
if you can start off with the biggest

00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:20,870
house possible it's probably better for

00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:20,870
your reputation but yes sir

00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:34,350
I stand up comic and I used to have

00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:36,090
right between 20 and 150 jokes a day

00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,000
that's writing mainly for other

00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:42,120
comedians and it's one of those things

00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,700
where if you're on if you're on that

00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,820
pace you just do it good better and

00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,500
different you just crank them out if

00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,870
you're a Stephen King and you have

00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,940
burnout you never get saw yourself in

00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:56,460
your mansion or your your speedboat or

00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,380
do we have something like this the folks

00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,080
I talked to who write technical books if

00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,330
you get burned out walk away from it for

00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,830
a day or two and then remind yourself

00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:07,920
you're a professional programmer you've

00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,780
written worst code sit down and start

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:17,120
writing and eventually something will

00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:17,120
get on the page and away you go sir

00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:50,140
most of the time when you get burned out

00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:54,550
it's because you're not put something

00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,900
down you know okay well I guess I can

00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:59,460
write this paragraph right now that

00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,460
doesn't seem too bad next thing you know

00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:16,210
professional writer I know before

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,380
tackling a major project they tend to

00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,360
write a lot histories there are a lot of

00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,640
detail a lot of research they'll do five

00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,680
years of research before writing the

00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,240
first paragraph of the book one of the

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,310
writing exercises they'll take something

00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,750
like a children's fairy tale and spend a

00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,950
half a day crafting it from the other

00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,750
side

00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:40,960
Goldilocks as a spy Little Red Riding

00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:42,790
Hood as a potential self suicide victim

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,990
wanting to kill herself but not having

00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,440
the guts to and trying to attract the

00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:49,300
wolf Hansel and Gretel as you know not

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,040
really the children being taken of the

00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,350
old lady they want to take over the

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,850
whole is down something just twisted and

00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,160
weird totally different from what they

00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,290
do and they'll spend a half-hour or half

00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,610
a day writing this just to get all the

00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:03,220
little weird flakiness out of there and

00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,720
they go back to the project and say okay

00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,100
this is what I want to do I've got all

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,480
the weird stuff out I've had this little

00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,480
red eye writing exercise there we go

00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:56,059
well what what we're growing up there

00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,849
are things Oh get your book published

00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:02,170
spend $5,000 get 50 copies of this book

00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:04,430
from the such-and-such vanity press and

00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:05,869
it's something where you do that you

00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,849
hand it out to your grandparents and

00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:12,740
everyone be happy but everyone knew that

00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:14,390
was kind of a pay-to-play book today

00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:17,569
with the online stuff there's a lot more

00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:20,299
options like the what the Kindle the

00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:22,250
Kindle publishing is I've known folks

00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:24,140
who have done art books buddy of mine

00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:27,799
published a scuba-diving photography art

00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,119
book each addition each copy was 500

00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:30,140
bucks and cost him close to half a

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,529
million dollars to have all the books

00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:36,140
printed and it was basically a exercise

00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:37,579
and love for him and for him was worth

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,869
selling his house to get his photographs

00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:41,690
off to people he knew would really

00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:43,010
appreciate it I don't know if you're

00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,940
probably not in that position but it's

00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,450
one of those things where if you have

00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:50,000
these photographs there's a book called

00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:52,490
a photographer's market go to that and

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,079
see they have guides on which photo

00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:55,880
editors are looking for photos which

00:52:54,079 --> 00:53:00,069
ones are writing books and how to

00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,069
assemble your own photo book so

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,069
yeah well this guy actually had the rice

00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,390
paper picked out and actually bought the

00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:33,740
rice paper before he went to the

00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,480
publishing house and said this is what I

00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,710
want this is the type of leather binding

00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,000
I want by the way I have the cows

00:53:36,710 --> 00:54:22,010
already picked out and yeah but he had

00:53:41,000 --> 00:54:23,809
more money than since there's a lot of

00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,760
color publishing done for the high-end

00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:27,500
graphic stuff I know an Aikido sensei

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,200
who was working with the Japanese

00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,420
publisher and when his demands got too

00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,859
much they sent him right to China and he

00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,780
made several ships of Shanghai to look

00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:37,250
at these amazing offset presses they

00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,410
have there to print off this book but

00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,760
it's very expensive and like I said he

00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:43,869
had a couple trips to China to go over

00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,869
to proof stuff so

00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,780
let's go refresh hole photographer knee

00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,550
is trying to be have his own show off

00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,460
but kind of his own his own I love me

00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,930
wall and it's one of those things for

00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,890
him the cost was exactly one because he

00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:38,140
knew what exactly what the color

00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:39,730
saturation he wanted he knew the Pantone

00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,830
colors he wanted for the highlights he

00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:44,140
had everything sussed out so basically

00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:46,000
he had it all assembled in his mind had

00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,200
all the instructions laid out before he

00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,920
actually wants the people who actually

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:56,980
just did the printing so ya get the

00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,550
photographers market 2019 or 2020 and

00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,550
see what they say

00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:52,950
yes I just returned something Dave said

00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,079
earlier about you know check with your

00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,700
employer before you write something

00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,290
because you know you may have your

00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,010
contract may state that your reporter

00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:10,290
owns everything a he's not kidding

00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:12,450
doesn't only you lock stock and barrel

00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:14,970
you don't have to agree to that bring a

00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:18,950
red pen whack out the sections you don't

00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:18,950
want they'll usually just say okay

00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:29,750
redline and initial it

00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,120
yeah

00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,700
make sure your boss knows make sure you

00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,380
have an accompanying company letterhead

00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:28,030
Tom Schultz who had the band Boston that

00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:31,990
was very popular when I was much much

00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:33,970
much younger supposedly his employers at

00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:35,620
Polaroid said you're getting a lot of

00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:41,200
money from these records we'd like some

00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:44,350
and supposedly his his contract with

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,460
them he had that laid out but if he

00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:48,610
hadn't if you hadn't had something on a

00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:49,720
piece of letterhead I can sure that you

00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,710
know it would have been Tom Schultz in

00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,710
