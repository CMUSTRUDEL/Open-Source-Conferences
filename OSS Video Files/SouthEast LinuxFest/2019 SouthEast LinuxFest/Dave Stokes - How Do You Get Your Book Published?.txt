So you want to write a book about an open source topic? Seeking fame, fortune, groupies, or something else? Well, buddy, you picked the wrong alternative universe.  This talk is about how I wrote the highly popular but not exactly profitable 'MySQL & JSON - A Practical Programming Guide', the mistakes I made, the mistakes the editor made (idempotent != impotent), the process I used to write the book, the process a sane person should use to write a book, and how the results leave me with a less than Kardashian Level Life style.  So if you have the urge to write a technical book or just want to laugh at me, this is your opportunity.
