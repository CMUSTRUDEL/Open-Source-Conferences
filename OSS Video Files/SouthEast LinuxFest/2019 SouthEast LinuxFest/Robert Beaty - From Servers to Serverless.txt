This is our journey from a traditional server based infrastructure to serverless. As a small company with an even smaller DevOps team supporting 200+ mobile apps with hundreds of thousands of users, we needed a better way to scale and support highly variable workloads. We will look at how we are solving this problem using a host of serverless and managed services, including Lambda, S3, Cloudfront, DynamoDB, API Gateway, SNS, React and more. Specific examples of the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM templates are included.
