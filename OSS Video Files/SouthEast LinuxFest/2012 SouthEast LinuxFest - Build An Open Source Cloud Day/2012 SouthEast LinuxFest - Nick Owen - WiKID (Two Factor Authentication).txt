the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,410

more information about the southeast

linux fest visit www.lend expense org

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,859
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,750
possible for them to do it the other

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,219
thing I would say is kudos to cloudflare

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,070
they have a blog post on this whole

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,410
attack they've been very open about it

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,149
which is very refreshing because a lot

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,550
of people just prefer to shove it under

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,899
the table if they can and that doesn't

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,809
really help the rest of us learn how

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,250
these things occur so you know for us

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,260
what we focused on is driving down the

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,610
costs of two factor authentication and

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,860
we've got an open source version I think

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,879
it's better than that ease of use is a

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,690
big one what we find is that people that

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,549
like like Linux and insecurity tend to

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,710
like to have control and so they don't

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,290
want to outsource the the keys to the

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,520
kingdom we also like to explore the

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,090
trade-offs between security and

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,409
usability because one of the reasons why

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,750
password still work is because they're

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,159
so usable for the end user and if we can

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,000
make them if we can make a system that's

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,409
easy enough for the end user to use as a

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,409
password that would be an incredibly

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,850
powerful situation so I'm gonna so this

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,500
is all new material for me I spent some

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,990
time with cloudstack and some of the

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,450
other systems and what I want to bring

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,479
here is kind of a broad brush look at

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,520
how we how authentication is treated

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,110
some of the some of the key points where

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,159
you should lock it down and then how to

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,700
do that yeah one thing I noticed was

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,200
that if you look at all of the

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,790
cloudstack managers there's there's a

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,710
consistent message so I spent the most

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,149
time with cloudstack mostly

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,560
alphabetically but I appreciate their

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,170
sponsorship of the room today and no

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,000
itself how about self is this whose

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,140
whose they been to self before who's the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
new people did you come because it was

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,819
in charl

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,590
or did you just hear about it would you

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:22,319
have gone to spark at spartansburg if

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,849
your if it is your first year did you

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,170
did you just find out about it this year

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:37,230
or did you come because of the new

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:41,790
location I think this is my third maybe

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,170
time speaking it's a good show all right

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,930
so I spent a lot of time with CloudStack

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:50,160
and out of the box they support an md5

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,860
hash password and an ldap to talk to

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,709
active directory to customize it they

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,630
have you basically take their md5 jar

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,450
file and override it okay so we actually

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,120
did that and we created a wicked user

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,349
Authenticator jar for cloudstack so you

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,989
can log into cloudstack with wicked and

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:13,470
it was pretty easy to do you basically

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,569
you know you write the jar build the jar

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,870
and then in the component XML file you

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:22,470
tell it to use that jar for the wicked

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,970
network client to use our API it needs

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,030
to know which wicked server to talk to

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:31,170
so you tell the IP address the port any

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,790
wicked Network client needs a p12 file

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,720
to talk to the wicked server so we do

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,920
client-based ssl and a domain and i'll

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,310
go through some more the wicked stuff

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,880
later on when i talk about that side of

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,130
it you have to turn off the md5 hashing

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,510
on the user interface and that's really

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,010
it on the cloud stack side so

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,639
integration with cloudstack was pretty

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,450
easy for us on the wicked side so just

00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,180
you know so wicked you know users groups

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,819
are you can group users and return

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,549
different radius attributes on that

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:08,069
domains is where we keep the users and

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,170
certain security parameters and it's how

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,970
the tokens actually find the server

00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,549
right so our tokens actually talk to the

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,539
server and that's via zero padded IP

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,609
address alright pin length passcode

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,380
lifetime max bad pen attempts max pad

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,530
passcode attempts are all admin

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,180
configurable by domain

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:33,160
so then you create a network client for

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:35,440
the CloudStack server and tell its IP

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,450
address and you create that certificate

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,730
that we saw and that's really all you

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,500
need from then on the users can use a

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,730
wicked token they generate the type in

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,920
their pin and get back a one-time

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,290
passcode and they can log into the cloud

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,050
stack administrator with wicked

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,820
two-factor authentication that's the

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,530
only one really had time for but we

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,320
looked at the OpenStack stuff and their

00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,810
Keystone API and that also looks pretty

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,040
easily extendable you know they've got

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:05,170
examples for Pam and a couple other

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,270
options they also have built in sport

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,450
for ldap and active directory so I think

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,740
we're seeing a theme here eucalyptus I

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,720
talked to some of the eucalyptus guys

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,910
online and Adam today with i think is

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
speaking later they support ldap and

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,560
active directory and they support

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,160
basically the ec2 api so part of their

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,740
thing is that they are really helping

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,990
you work with ec2 and so they're kind of

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,060
limited in their options so I haven't

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,580
quite figured out whether it's possible

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,740
for you to use a different

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,290
authentication mechanism of what Amazon

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,450
provides which could be a Caribbean I

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,730
think that's probably one of those

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,260
things where if you're using eucalyptus

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,990
you're in bed with Amazon and you're

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,280
going that way OpenStack and cloudstack

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,220
appear to be more like if you doing a

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,919
private cloud infrastructure and may

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,610
want to keep more stuff at home so

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:02,230
that's the stack managers the other key

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,950
piece here is host authentication right

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,050
so if you've got a and this also applies

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,120
to actually the cloud sax server at the

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,550
OS level and the hypervisor server at

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,419
the OS level but if you've got hosts

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,650
that are running in virtual environments

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:21,880
how do you do authentication to those so

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,980
for linux this means pam the pluggable

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,400
authentication module and for windows it

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:32,230
means something else which typically

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:36,240
would be our DP or VNC the the trick

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:39,040
here is to look at free and X which is a

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,410
you know a remote access tool that's

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,310
pretty cool it's extremely fast so we'll

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,180
delve into this and this is Pam how many

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,460
of y'all have played with Pam and

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,680
understand how it works or have played

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,240
with Pam and got it to work yeah that's

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,710
that's gotten the way it is right it's

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,220
working now copied everywhere don't

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,900
touch anything it is really in each in

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,310
each OS flavor does a little bit

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,040
differently which is also kind of

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,940
annoying but once you get it you get so

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:10,540
much everything you know SSH to do login

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:14,140
all the key processes and Linux to use

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,880
pam and I've had postgresql will support

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,910
Pam right so if you think about those

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,590
attackers who get on your box and then

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,530
want to get into postgres you know

00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,790
that's a key lock down area I've set up

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:32,770
a jabber IM server that supported pam

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:36,160
just as a proof of concept so for Pam

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,650
radius which you know I'm going to start

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,680
talking a lot about radius radius is a

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,140
great protocol it is for your land right

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,290
it's only encoded it's not encrypted but

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,350
it is it's a really standard standard

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,780
which is really nice and all you need to

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:56,490
set it up pretty much is an IP address

00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:00,070
and a shared secret right so in your

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,510
configuration file which is at c-rad DB

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,360
server although it might have moved

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:07,210
recently to etsy radius calm and it may

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,740
again depend on your OS flavor you tell

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,230
it where the server IP where the server

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,050
is and the shared secret then in your

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,240
service file for example sshd which an

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,350
entirely looks like this you tell it

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,380
that it can use radius for

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:24,370
authentication note that you still have

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:30,010
to do system off somehow which could be

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:32,020
an account on the box or via ldap so

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,789
what I would recommend can you know and

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,650
again this depends on your deployment

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,690
what you're trying to do but what I

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,169
recommend to people is they use an SSH

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,760
gateway box that is locked down with two

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,770
factor authentication and from there you

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,050
perform commands across all your hosts

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:52,310
or across or have

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:55,459
have ssh keys to get in so why would you

00:08:52,310 --> 00:09:04,459
if you have ssh keys also need a

00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:06,800
one-time password yes but many would

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,649
argue that having the ssh key is to

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,110
factor if it's protected by a password

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,820
so the add the answer is compliance

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,310
because for compliance you might need to

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,110
prove how long that password is you

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,810
might need but maybe might need to be

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,850
able to regen keys you know and so

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,620
you've got all those issues which ssh is

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,050
a great product but even though the

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,899
newer versions now can require our

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,890
client to have a password on their key

00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,140
you don't know that someone just didn't

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,300
recompile you know the program to say it

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,980
has a password so there's compliance

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,589
issues around that the other thing that

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,870
I like to point out is it from a

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:44,060
Enterprise standpoint it's good to have

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,170
all the puppies in a box right which

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,000
means that you've got all your

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,160
authentication and authorization going

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,640
through one process so if you've got an

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,589
assistant in who's got ssh keys and land

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,779
access through LDAP or Active Directory

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,420
and whatever else it's good to have that

00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:01,220
all through one process and Pam and

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,950
radius will do that which will will dig

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,709
into and if you want to be paranoid

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,510
because sue do is a separate process you

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:11,899
can have soo do require a one-time

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:15,709
passcode I just love the flexibility of

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:17,060
Linux the other way to lock down a

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,100
virtual environment would be at the

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,930
network layer it could be on your you

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,440
know how to get into your network or it

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,730
could be on the virtual network and

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,310
again radius is quite simple for this

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,959
deal with pfsense all you need to do is

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,660
you know tell it to use radius IP

00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,790
address and server with the openvpn AS

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,100
server the commercial version against

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:41,000
web interface IP address shared secret

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,380
with the with the community version you

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,149
need to create a service file for

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,010
openvpn it would literally pie just have

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,190
that one line the authentication line in

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,800
it and tell the client to prompt for a

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,829
username and password and on the server

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,360
side tell it to use the pam

00:10:54,829 --> 00:11:00,660
authentication module and point it to

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,360
the service file you created in step one

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,980
the end how many people use a openvpn

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,270
it's it's a very good product the

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,650
interesting thing about this setup is

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,260
that if you're using a separate

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,900
authentication mechanism you don't have

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,850
to do individual search for each user

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,860
because the search are only doing

00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:24,430
encryption so it makes your diploma a

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:25,840
little bit easier it starts or pain so

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,580
remote desktop you know we have we have

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,930
one customer that's using you know

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,310
they've got pretty much Linux everywhere

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,620
except for their credit card processing

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,830
boxes which are in which are in windows

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:40,630
so they virtualized them and then access

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:42,670
them via free and x 3 and x NX is the

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,350
protocol no machine is the company that

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,630
created it they also have a commercial

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,300
version free and X is a little bit long

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,350
in the tooth in terms of the package you

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,970
know bug fixes there's a couple of new

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,500
projects out their tac-x and need X

00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,130
which is actually backed by Google which

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,430
is kind of interesting it's very

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,880
powerful program you get remote X VNC

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,230
rdp it's all tunneled through ssh so

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,120
there's a client you download from no

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,980
machine tunnels everything to rest this

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,440
H the server on that side does

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,260
authentication be a Pam and then routes

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,000
out the VNC and rdp traffic it is

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,390
actually I think faster than doing

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,280
unencrypted VNC so it's quite innocent

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,790
ass so much I mean have you ever tried

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:30,220
to set up VNC through ssh just god-awful

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:34,540
this is a very clean and easy to use

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:37,900
process very fast alright so that's the

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,810
host that's the stack managers the third

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,640
piece maybe depending on your needs the

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,280
application and i'm not talking about

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,900
Angry Birds typically what you're seeing

00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,750
I think these days was going to be some

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,250
type of web application and you know we

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,450
have we do have an API we've got

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:58,020
packages for Python Java PHP Ruby and

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,760
c-sharp so if you want to embed

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,640
two-factor authentication into your

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,820
application those are lgpl packages so

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,380
fruit have at it but Apache is if you

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,780
can if you can you know Apache so

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,350
flexible and so powerful that this is a

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,380
great way to set things up and

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,440
you get all your your web apps if they

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,670
support HP off CMS is webmail WordPress

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,960
all that stuff so how does that look on

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,180
a boon to you can actually apt-get

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,900
install the lib the liberators package

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,520
in the HP comp file again you give it

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,760
the server IP address and the shared

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,000
secret you have to set a cookie if you

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,590
don't you're you know if you've got for

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,030
each request you go and hit the one time

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,280
password server that one time password

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:47,630
server is going to fail after one time

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,480
so you do need the cookie then you can

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,490
protect any section any location

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,340
location match directory virtual server

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,260
with radius and so that's a very easy

00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,860
way to add two factor authentication to

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,750
any web app for example your WordPress

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,460
admin you know you might not want to

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,390
press you you might want to lock you

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,750
might not want to lock down your

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:10,640
WordPress site but your admin you may

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,290
want to lock down and you can do that by

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:18,200
protecting that area and I think the

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:21,110
login PHP site okay so where are we what

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,850
does it look like so as I've noted all

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,920
of the CloudStack manager software

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,590
packages are supporting active directory

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,870
why is that because everybody you know

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,850
not everybody's not everybody in this

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,280
conference but most of the world has

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,480
their users in active directory and but

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,640
what does it end up looking like you

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,680
know okay well we can do w off here we

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,000
can do ldap here we could do radius here

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,890
but there's is kind of a gap right and

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:53,600
if you're an enterprise deployment you

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:56,420
want to fix that why usually this it's a

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,490
security feature right you want to be

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,590
able to disable a user in one place and

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:04,460
have the right person do that and have

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,620
it to be effective everywhere and it

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,000
also allows you to you know replace the

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,850
parts more easily you can start off with

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,860
a with like by the highest and the

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,050
highest in net gearbox which is a pretty

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,210
low piece of crap will support radius

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,100
and allow you to set this up you can

00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,260
then switch in a pfsense a cisco

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,060
whatever else all you're doing is going

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,010
and set it up saying okay talk radius to

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,800
this and it's done you can switch from

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,870
you know whatever type of authentication

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,490
server you want you can do more than one

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,960
authentication server right so you can

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,700
have a certain group of users that go to

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,410
an RSA server a certain group that go to

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,000
wicked you can have a certain group that

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,680
stop and just do passwords in another

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,650
group that goes in and do and does to

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,320
factor I also like the concept that you

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,690
can have a PFC pfsense bsd base firewall

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,850
talking to windows talking to linux all

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:54,990
via standard protocol i mean who would

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,390
have thought so that's kind of what it

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,980
looks like if you're using radius you

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,540
can't really do this with ldap or

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,720
Kerberos and and it's really not that

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,380
bad to set up except if you're using

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,060
Windows that's where it gets complex so

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,710
I'll step you through this is a little

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,980
bit i have a page on this on our website

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:19,350
on how to setup this is NPS this is the

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:24,720
windows radius plug in the network

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:26,610
policy server and it's it's funny you

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,100
know we do a lot of pre-sales

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,140
engineering and but almost all of the

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,090
discussions around okay if so I've got

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,100
the wicked server setup now how do I get

00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,270
it to talk to my cisco box how do I

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,460
going to talk to my win you know how do

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,370
I do this and so we're always doing

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,870
support for juniper and cisco and and if

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,640
when people get testy with me i'm like

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,560
well why don't you go to pound microsoft

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,300
and see and see how they're you know

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,350
IRSC support is usually keep so again

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,030
what we're doing is we're going to set

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,120
up the this is the radius client right

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,760
so your VPN your cloudstack manager your

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,020
web app would be the client you give it

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,640
the shared secret then you go in and

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,050
create a server this would be the wicked

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,820
server or your two-factor authentication

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:14,000
server you give it a shared secret some

00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:17,100
of these things like the you know the

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,500
authenticator attribute things like that

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,980
can be specific to each two-factor

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,320
authentication server then you create a

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,400
connection request policy alright so

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,640
basically what we're going to say is

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,100
that everything that comes in on that IP

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,770
address should go to the wicked server

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:38,130
and that's kind of it so you can also

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,000
specify it via incoming IP address right

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,010
so you can have everybody that's going

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,710
into a

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,870
the hypervisor host needs to have two

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,390
factor authentication ever news logging

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,150
into the web app just needs this needs

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,549
an active directory I credit credentials

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,990
and yes of course you can do this with

00:17:53,549 --> 00:18:01,289
freeradius an ldap openldap as well it's

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:05,730
you know it's doable it's not it's not

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:09,179
excessively complex but so I'll talk a

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,929
little bit about single sign-on you know

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,429
we do have a number of customers not

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,580
necessary doing single sign-on so much

00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,860
but doing Google Apps and Salesforce and

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,090
we support google apps out of the box we

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,490
don't support sales force out of the box

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,220
but this is an interesting thing how is

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,960
anyone any CloudStack or OpenStack

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,730
developers here are people from those

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,529
companies are you so you contributors so

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,690
y'all are y'all y'all are Enterprise

00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:40,370
people you would be deploying this stuff

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,720
you're looking at deploying it okay so

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,970
this is probably called jaw so the java

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,770
open sores single sign-on project it's

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,409
from a company called a talk or I'll

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,270
this is I looked at a lot of these myla

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:52,320
to a couple of tea and looked at three

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,330
or four of these guys there's another

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,330
one called open am that used to be the

00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,159
son product the two that I was able to

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,940
do with two of the more simple ones to

00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:05,190
set up ja so is pretty cool you

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,490
basically can all in this graphic

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,830
interface go in and design out your

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,510
identified entity system they have

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:18,120
support for pledges something going

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:19,950
extra loud they have support for the

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,559
wicked open source version so they're

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,440
using our wapi you drop a little wicked

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,929
icon in there click on it and give it

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,700
the same parameters as in the cloud

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,190
stack example the certificate the

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,870
passphrase the IP address and it will

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,179
route all the authentications through

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,470
the wicked then you drop in like a in

00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,909
this example I'll just use a tomcat

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,230
connector drop that in and and set it up

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:45,390
and it's good to go and then you hit

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,340
publish and it spits out all the code

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,620
which is pretty cool I mean the other

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,180
one that I looked at was Kass

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:57,460
which is kind of a maven based java

00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,020
system it builds out war files yet you

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,300
go in and you basically say okay I want

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,630
to build it with radius and here are my

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,020
radius parameters and so from that

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,880
sample one you can get any any casa fide

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:14,370
application which includes tomcat jboss

00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:17,920
all that other stuff can route

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,780
authentications through radius so that

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:27,640
is I thought that was worth discussing

00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:28,870
about okay so to wrap up beer early you

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,570
know I think the I think the key thing

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,550
to think about is risk management when

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,980
you look at how the attacks occur how

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,610
they start in one place and head to the

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,990
other there's sort of two things one is

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,210
you gotta lock down from the script

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,610
kiddies which means you know the

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,790
blocking and tackling of changing the

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,910
default credentials making sure that

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,890
users are using strong passwords but if

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,140
it's going to be a determined attacker

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,910
they're going to get in they're gonna

00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,380
they're going to find some way to get in

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,660
you need to make sure they can't

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,850
actually do damage before you catch them

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,880
and I think that's where two-factor

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,440
authentication can really play a role

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,120
you know that maybe your CloudStack

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,809
manager which certainly if you're you

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,460
know if you're which is a high-risk area

00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:18,340
in terms of them being able to get all

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,980
your information and control your

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,650
systems it could be those the hypervisor

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,400
host the cloud psych major host it could

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,170
actually be the virtual machines and you

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,900
know then think about the roles too is

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,610
it just a user is it a route you know

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,670
what's the what's the authorization that

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:40,870
they have and how important is that to

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:41,559
your enterprise you know two-factor

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,440
authentication I mean I think

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:47,080
historically people think of it as just

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,630
an expensive hassle and I think that's

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,360
rapidly changing whether you're going to

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,580
use a service that you know you know

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,630
send you pass codes or you're going to

00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,640
do something where you deploy it

00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:02,050
yourself it's really not that bad so I

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,429
think that's about it I don't hopefully

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,970
it'll be some questions otherwise we can

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:16,080
all go and

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:16,080
hit the booth yes now

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:27,500
yeah so um so the question is about duos

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:30,050
do a security and you know they are it's

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,730
in it's an interesting product it's it's

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:38,750
a service right you you get there you

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,510
get a plug-in from them right and it

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,720
sits on your network your users contact

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:47,120
them they support you know I think one

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:53,000
thing is that they support like dial

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,220
back SMS as well as software tokens so

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,640
there's a couple things one is you know

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,290
you're relying on them as a service and

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,910
that Mayor you know that may be that may

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,530
be more secure than what you could

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,880
provide yourself and I think this is

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,170
where people you know people in Finnish

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,160
skirt is like oh it's on the cloud it's

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,570
never you know it's never gonna be

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,520
secure than that but they're often in

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,530
their bubble of information security at

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,410
large companies or their you know their

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,060
the industry analysts if you're going to

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,130
hire an industry analysts you're already

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,030
in a different market right so you know

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,740
for most people you know you most most

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,990
particular this is a linux college most

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,680
windows admin cannot secure an exchange

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:35,480
server right and you know they should be

00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,360
on google apps you know it's and so so

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,900
running it as a service may make risk

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,310
management sense for your enterprise

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,930
what what i don't understand i guess

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,060
from their standpoint is you know what

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:50,030
what control do you have over user

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,280
enable and disable meant what's the

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,570
recessed what's the reset process you

00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,580
know how are they going to get attacked

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,860
who would have thought that google's

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,150
two-factor authentication would be

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,020
successfully attacked right i mean

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:06,430
google does it pretty well i would also

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,920
say i think that a lot of those services

00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,880
have a you know it's kind of like back

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,530
in the days when you didn't have

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,180
unlimited data and you went over it all

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,390
of a sudden you know it's like you've

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:20,210
been making international calls because

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:23,750
they start off as being you know three

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,490
bucks a month and but when you go over a

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,770
certain number of authentications or

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,740
dial ins or dial backs or SMS text

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:34,370
messages it hits you up so with wicked

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,880
our pricing is very simple it's it

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,040
starts at twenty-four dollars per user

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,929
per year we've got a tent a 10-seat

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,130
minimum so it's two hundred forty bucks

00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:48,290
I think they started out as 10 free or

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,600
five free and then go to three bucks a

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,150
month so it may just depend on where

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,950
your user base is those guys are in

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,630
Strix are about that you see did you see

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,350
that their app was taking down the

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,990
android market so they did it they did I

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,580
have sort of looked at the video but I

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,880
was kind of working on this presentation

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,920
about something called doorbuster or

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,770
something like that that was a way to

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,020
try and break the security of the

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,370
android market so they were they were

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,590
actually kicked out of the developer

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,940
program but they got five million

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:24,530
dollars in venture funding from google

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,420
so you know I like those guys they're

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,280
pretty funny we ran in at we're an an ad

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,020
on reddit in net sec and one of them

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,120
Hopton says hey you know plug for duo

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,320
and I'm like okay well next time you run

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,620
an ad i'm going to do a plug for wicked

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,850
he's like that's cool but there are you

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,460
know it's the same with phone factor

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,990
it's a service you know it really

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,940
depends on your risk management

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,429
tolerance and what you want to do and

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,230
whether you want the keys of the kingdom

00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:51,190
at home or whether you're more

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,190
comfortable hug them out there

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,580
yes

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:23,220
oh oh yeah yeah yeah so I mean our

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,740
server would sit behind a pfsense

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,120
firewall and essentially what the

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,800
traffic flow would be you know our

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,300
tokens actually use port 80 right so

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,940
we're using a symmetric encryption so we

00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,650
don't need for 43 so that token traffic

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,809
needs to go to the server everything

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,500
else would be internal and we've got

00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:44,570
customers that have set up wicked have

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,570
set up pfsense to talk to wicked and

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:54,570
okay yeah well that's a good question I

00:26:51,030 --> 00:27:03,590
don't know about that specifically how's

00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:03,590
authentication done in pf okay

00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:16,560
yeah I what I would say is that I think

00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,840
I mean I would say it's doable I mean

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,240
there's really you know in bsd in linux

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,190
it's everything is doable I think it's

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:30,180
just a matter of what the configuration

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:34,800
options are well we support radius and

00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:37,200
ldap and tax and you know we rarely see

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,000
tax it's usually only for people that

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,490
have a lot of Cisco switches in their

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,190
environment and need to do authorization

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:49,260
embedded with authentication radius is

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,590
just really simple and gets you that

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,200
directory integration and proxying so

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,630
that's typically what we see but there's

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,250
no reason if you know particularly for

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,780
smaller organizations organizations

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,550
where there's enough automation where

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,010
you can maybe you know you can you can

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,780
design a system to kill a user here here

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:10,350
and here if you have the discipline to

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:14,100
use it and and it works you know out of

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:16,140
the box so it could be that you have you

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,570
know SSH to here and then to factor

00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,130
there I think I think it's doable I just

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,750
don't know enough about PF to make to

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,750
make a decision or a recommendation

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:32,060
right I would think I mean if it's a I

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,060
can't imagine it wouldn't work

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,890
you

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,959
and you need to and you're concerned

00:28:55,409 --> 00:29:08,609
about the files being you're concerned

00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:10,169
about authentication okay yeah yeah yeah

00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:16,379
so the question is around sort of a

00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:22,609
shared working space that it secured

00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:25,979
ad-hoc sharing how do they do it now

00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:31,229
they don't okay okay so there's no no ad

00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:33,629
hoc sharing right now think about that

00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:35,099
so the question is we was what

00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:36,539
application you would use that would

00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:38,659
work I mean I could think of that would

00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:44,759
be a pretty simple content management

00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:49,489
system and you know like we use plone on

00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:52,199
our web server and it has a lot of

00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:55,859
functionality and we have a plone plug

00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:57,509
into but it also supports HTTP off so

00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:59,279
you could easily do two-factor

00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:01,729
authentication and then just choose the

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,769
right content management system to allow

00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:09,989
users to easily drop in and share

00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:13,039
content and files and you know just

00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:13,039
delete it all at the end

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,210
ok

00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,870
yeah I mean it's sort of it's sort of

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,340
really two things right it's the and I

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,400
guess the response about Shibboleth and

00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,380
shibboleths to me seems to be a you know

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,130
it's a single sign-on type of

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,809
application that handles the

00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,210
authorization and the authentication

00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:58,490
right when you do that is the Shibboleth

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,440
at your location or these people coming

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:11,770
from or is it are you tapping back into

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:11,770
the university over there entities yes

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,580
yes okay so chipola is something that

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,960
will do that entity the entity trust

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:32,990
model but you still have to to to

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,040
provision users so I don't know the I

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,450
don't necessarily know the answer that I

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:40,700
can tell you what we what we have the

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:41,870
capability of doing is VR API it the

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,850
multi-tenancy the content of

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,620
multi-tenancy is built in so you can you

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,960
can put up you can pop up a little web

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:52,790
app that has our our API and has a the

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,590
p12 file to trust relationship back to

00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:58,190
the wicked server that could be at

00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:01,100
University a and university a could

00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:03,410
protect that or have an admin run that

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,420
or protect it via their active directory

00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:07,910
credentials and so they could say okay

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,720
every you know every everyone is going

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:15,590
to be involved in project be register

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,240
your wicked token here and they would

00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,750
get their two-factor authentication set

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,760
up there to login over here at the end

00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:28,040
of the project you can kill that

00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:31,520
certificate and they're all gone does

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,350
that make sense so it pushes control of

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,900
the users and user provisioning down to

00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,400
where the users live but you maintain

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,380
control of the entire relationship and

00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,190
also you maintain control of users here

00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,190
at the wicked server level

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:56,470
yeah we have so all first of all of our

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:59,170
pricing is online I hate it when you go

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,480
someplace and it's like caught you know

00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,790
free up to here then call sales people

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,730
you know who wants to do that so all of

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,470
our pricing is online our first price

00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,560
break is like it 500 users and then it

00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,780
just drops down and you know we're very

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,280
so here's what if you have if you come

00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,110
to me and say hey these guys are cheaper

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,030
than you and I'll evaluate it I will

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,490
lower everyone's price I don't we don't

00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,470
give any special deals it always amazing

00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,970
people like we have to call you and talk

00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,680
to you eight times to see if we can get

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:31,030
a lower price how does that lower my

00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,520
costs so we're pretty staunch about that

00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,680
but very open on pricing and it drops

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,330
down to I don't know I don't know how

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,490
low it goes we haven't reached that

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,830
level yet we actually I was talking to

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,420
someone about you know they have a

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:48,430
freemium model for their cloud

00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:50,230
application and you know I know they can

00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,720
go get our open source solution and set

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,980
it up and run it for free so I want to

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,320
upsell them and we're like maybe we

00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:59,170
could do an unlimited license you know

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,710
you pay us so much per month and you

00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,710
just get it

00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,929
use the same seat license right so they

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,760
so you would have a wicked server and

00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,089
you would have 100 seats and no matter

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,770
who the people are we don't care and you

00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:26,940
know we don't have a concept of session

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,819
or any like that because that's always

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,359
at the firewall or app but it's just

00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:34,889
seat licenses and in that we get that a

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,690
lot where people people that use a lot

00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,280
of contractors because getting the

00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,190
hardware back from contractors is

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,179
impossible so we see that a lot the

00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,190
other thing is you can have multiple

00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,720
each user can have multiple tokens so

00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,369
you can have one of your pc and one of

00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,470
your iphone and one of your ipad and

00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:53,339
that's what we find is the that's the

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:55,319
that's the c-suite solution is you just

00:34:53,339 --> 00:35:00,329
give them tokens everywhere so they

00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:06,390
never have to be without yeah so that's

00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:07,589
another good question anything else well

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:10,770
good our questions kind of brought us up

00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:12,599
to sort of where we need to be I'm at a

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,430
booth over there if you want the

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,970
cocktail shaker you probably get 12 digs

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:20,910
I'm running low i'll also be in the bar

00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:25,309
tomorrow night watching the belmont so

00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,309
come see me then thanks very much

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:40,720
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,880
way to better utilize all your resources

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,330
and it makes managing all your resources

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,160
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:53,680
happening in open source the

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,480
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,400
of the community and the speed at which

00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,590
these are these you know these

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,930
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:04,510
discovered and then fixed is it I think

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:07,150
that really shows the power of the you

00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,830
know of the open source community it is

00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:13,030
global and it's definitely because of

00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:19,360
the users community people are extremely

00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:21,130
friendly and almost ready to help if you

00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,720
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,670
these guys helping each other out and

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,580
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,410
manner the product is transparent for

00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,610
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:35,650
base everyone can see how close darkest

00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:41,500
is being built nothing nothing is

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:44,140
proprietary everything is open in many

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:48,340
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:52,120
ongoing health cloudstack the most

00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:55,950
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:58,680
was our first developer boot camp

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:01,320
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:05,280
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:09,450
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,300
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,820
chairs in the room twice everything

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,060
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:21,150
is open source and so I don't think that

00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,890
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,920
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:28,470
computing and so i think it's i think

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,000
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,110
about cloud computing you're really

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,660
talking about open source cloud

00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:39,810
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,210
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:46,110
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:48,780
each data centers these hardware is

00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:52,260
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:54,990
to handle number one that mass scale

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,140
number two it's designed to handle the

00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:00,690
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:05,220
deployments started working on cloud

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:08,460
tech over four years ago and it was the

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,260
original set of people working on it had

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,370
a background of delivering software

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:18,600
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:22,230
lots of users actually using it high

00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:25,290
availability is the key feature multiple

00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,480
hypervisors support different network

00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,480
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,250
better while step management server can

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,940
be deployed in different physical

00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,590
machines it definitely has a huge

00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:42,600
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:45,180
there's a major movie studio that they

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,480
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,460
to transcode video and i thought that

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,080
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,350
more fascinating is what they did during

00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,140
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:59,310
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,140
lunch was over they would this

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:05,280
all the instances and go back to doing

00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,900
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,970
so many different aspects and there's no

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,370
one person that's kind of like a master

00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:15,480
of all those realms I think cloudstack

00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:17,700
as a project is going to be one of the

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,750
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:27,180
most feature fallen and and robust

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:30,110
platforms out they were I don't senior

00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,110
living through the clouds dag

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,740
you

00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,029
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,979
ago we could not have imagined that

00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:28,170
asterisk would not only become the most

00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:30,329
widely adopted open source communication

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,369
software on the planet but that it would

00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:34,890
impact the entire industry in the way

00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:36,869
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,479
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:41,460
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:43,529
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,940
transition of power from the hands of

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:47,219
the traditional proprietary phone

00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,619
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:51,539
administrators of phone systems using

00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,769
this power our customers have created

00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:54,719
all sorts of business changing

00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:56,579
applications from small office phone

00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,069
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,690
the international carrier networks in

00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:02,489
fact there's even an entire country

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,859
those communications infrastructure runs

00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:06,989
on esters the gym has always been about

00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:08,700
creating technology that expands

00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:10,890
communications capabilities in ways that

00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,089
we could never have imagined and that's

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,819
part of what's game-changing about

00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:17,160
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:19,259
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,390
IP phones that extends control of the

00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:23,130
user all the way to the desktop the

00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,839
launch of these new products represents

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,940
the next phase in Digium history of

00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:29,339
innovation these are the first and only

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,690
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,369
power of esther's when we first

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,599
discussed our expectations for building

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,489
a family of phones for use with

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,710
asterisks our requirements were pretty

00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:39,059
simple we asked the team to build the

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,369
phones such that they were easy to

00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,559
install integrate provision and use I

00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:45,630
think you'll soon agree our engineers

00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,430
have delivered on that goal user

00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,049
feedback is validating that when it

00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,479
comes to operation with astro space

00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:53,430
systems including our own Switchvox

00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:56,099
based product these are the easiest to

00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,440
use best integrated most interoperable

00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,119
products on the market today the Digium

00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,549
family of phones will initially include

00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,769
three IP desk phones uniquely designed

00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:06,630
to complement any asterisk or Switchvox

00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:08,729
based solution these phones are

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,920
different for a number of reasons first

00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:13,200
there is clue sively designed for use

00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,819
with esters secondly we've made it

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,279
really easy to autodiscover and

00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:18,390
provision the phones next we've made it

00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:20,910
easy for the phones to access

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,940
information inside of asterisks allowing

00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,640
tight coupling between an application

00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,800
the phone additionally we've created an

00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,930
applications engine that allows users

00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,510
and developers to create and run their

00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,579
own apps on the following and finally

00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,650
we've done all of this at a very

00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:38,329
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,099
always thinking of ways to give our

00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,500
customers the best value in business

00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,359
phone systems and also give them the

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,520
power to create their own solutions or

00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,319
eating communications challenge well

00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,089
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,130
to make astros cooler bastard more

00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,750
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,240
asterisk and what communications even

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:59,349
easier and together we'll change the way

00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,349
