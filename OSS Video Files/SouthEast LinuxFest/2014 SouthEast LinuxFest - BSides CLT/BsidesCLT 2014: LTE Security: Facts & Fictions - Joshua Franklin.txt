	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
I saw the submission come through I

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,730
started geeking out and asking everybody

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:16,350
who is this county so I'm looking

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:20,820
forward to the stock so a little bit of

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,010
a quick story when I so submitted here i

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,170
thought that i was submitting to a town

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,170
that's about to annette hours from DC

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:37,590
Jefferson's house and it yeah so I

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,540
showed my my my girlfriend you know hey

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,790
I got accepted here and she's like

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:49,170
that's kind of a long drive I was like

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:52,350
oh what no no yes Charlotte which is not

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,489
sure what's built so so that's kind of

00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:04,260
how I got here when I'm super excited to

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:07,430
be a Jame so so today we are going to

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,430
talk a little bit about

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:17,860
okay so today we are we are going to

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,070
talk about LTE security um there is a

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:26,950
much longer date our class I have

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:31,149
developed up about GSM UMTS and LTE and

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:35,740
LTE but this is basically a small and

00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:38,740
quick dirty intro to LTE networks and

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,250
LTE security and we are really going to

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,539
look at it from a standards-based

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:49,869
perspective you see a lot of different

00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:51,520
security claims about about LTE and

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,520
there was one that was really really

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,640
bothering me and that was the this whole

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,370
notion

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:04,760
and to end LTE security people were

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:08,750
basically saying that you know LTE is is

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,920
is encrypted from start to imagine so I

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:16,760
want to show some of the standards later

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,250
and show why that's probably not true

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,439
and you can make your own judgments but

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,230
I'm just showing you these the standards

00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:29,420
and basically providing some evidence

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:31,760
about my security claims so we are we

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,150
are going to talk about different so

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,970
there are standards and importance other

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,650
concepts LTE network architectures the

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,190
security architecture and then I'll

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,340
provide some stuff for some further so

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:56,060
further reading so I have Josh Franklin

00:02:46,340 --> 00:03:00,650
from DC 27 a totally 63 so yeah I do i

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:03,230
do work at a nest I I focus in public

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:11,379
safety networks mobile security hardware

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:11,379
roots of trust and electronic voting so

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:20,860
so what is LT LT LTE that is the long

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,610
term evolution that is the fourth I

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:28,930
could say for its 4G whatever whatever

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:33,460
that means it's basically be deployed

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,960
worldwide it's really really nice that

00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,570
we're starting to have it a nice

00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,100
worldwide send their standard before

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,080
it's kind of fractured you have gsm cdma

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,790
you're really really focusing on one us

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,230
sort of having our own little fight

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,270
without one and then we had whatever

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:55,160
Japan was doing

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:57,230
yeah so uh a LTE super super cool it's

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,070
probably here to stay for a long time so

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:04,490
it's it's definitely worth your time in

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:08,120
picking up some LTE knowledge here LTE

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:12,470
is is basically always evolving there's

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,080
a standards group called 3gpp that that

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,110
actually develops these of standards and

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,810
they drop of new releases which is

00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,840
basically we have you know 400 documents

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,840
and worship stop adding the stop stop

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:33,680
editing them now and that's called a of

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:36,490
fries or a release and so LTE release 12

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,920
is actually coming on in December 2014

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,010
but you know there's going to be you

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,639
know lte-advanced and then what does it

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:52,430
LTE be as what I hear three of three

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,430
to basically every new drop as

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,889
standards 3gpp is the standards body

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,319
that is that is actually developing

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:22,699
these standards the same standards

00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:27,199
bonded both gsm and UMTS caesar come

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:29,300
completely open and viewable standards

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,880
it's not like it's not like I saw where

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,449
you have pain or forty five francs your

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,520
Swiss francs to look at mobile or

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,620
whatever it is 3gpp is actually made of

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,530
six different standards development

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,509
organizations that are basically from

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:49,400
different parts of the whole world you

00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:52,370
see erith there Addis is the North

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,030
America's you see XE here also and

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,550
that's Europe's and Etsy does a lot of

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,750
the crypto standards so a lot of the the

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,750
base of the coin

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,810
there are other organ of organizations

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:13,380
3gpp2 which is the most confusing in the

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,740
whole world develops cma and their hold

00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:22,860
their whole why and there's also the OBO

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:26,760
MX form which day Belvoir max 3gpp2 just

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,560
at a quick note was developing a cdma

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,520
variant

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,800
4G and it was called UMB and thankfully

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,060
they ate a stock and so America's all

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,270
moving towards the same technology there

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,970
ain't no long on it on bottle of this

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,889
3gpp has technical reports which kind of

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,200
more like book reports and you know

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,380
analyses and then there's there's actual

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,790
technical specifications which are

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,550
requirements documents you'll probably

00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:01,500
have to read both cellar standards use

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:05,190
lots of jargon and and abbreviations

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,860
frequently nested acronyms are common

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:12,419
and this is one of the fun things I have

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,370
found a 3 a 3 depth nested acronym I was

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,290
you know I'm really really curious if

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,960
anyone else has seen any you know

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,710
anything that goes further so for

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,080
instance G ran stands for GPRS evolution

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,330
radio access network and GPRS stands for

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,360
like a general packet after i forget

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,100
what GPRS technically stands for so i've

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,380
seen four of those though and so you

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,400
know let me know if you find anything

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:42,150
deeper open challenge open challenge so

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,030
packets and circuits previously any

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,820
voice tect like basically any voice

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,740
technology was basically using a circuit

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,979
fork for communication which is

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:57,030
basically fixed fixed bandwidth you know

00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,720
guaranteed bandwidth and you know that

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:04,770
that actually happened with the PSTN and

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,110
and it happened with gsm and and um TS

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,330
and so basically if you wanted data you

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,440
had to have distinct data networks and

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:15,690
so you had a gsm talking sorry a gsm

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,690
voice traffic going to the core network

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,669
and then you had a distinct GPRS packet

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,950
switched Network that had to converge on

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,350
the core network and so LTE is really

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,030
really different their LTE is completely

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,690
packet-based which is really really

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:35,330
interesting it there is volte which is

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:37,770
voice over LTE sorry voice over LTE

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,080
which is another that's the third that's

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,080
a third level nesib acronym right anyway

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,400
so so a VoIP is but is but one way of

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,850
doing voiceover over LTE there are a

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:57,110
bunch of others right now if you do make

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,870
a call on LT on LTE you are most likely

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,890
falling falling back to either CD cdma

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:08,360
gsm or um TS so it's not actually

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:10,730
implemented nationwide yet so the big

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,270
lesson here is LTE is completely

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,390
ip-based which actually means that a

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:20,570
once you like you can do a lot more with

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,430
with LTE networks now but it like now

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,610
that all the the different offensive

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,350
tools you know are all tcp/ip you know

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,110
you know packet based basically whereas

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,910
it's very very different in the past the

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,860
cellular standards this is how I think

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:38,540
of it you have 3gpp circuit-switched

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,530
which you see the the the gsm 2g tech

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,560
and you see the the UMTS 3g tech there

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:50,830
in that one column you have the 3gpp

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,580
packet-switched which is GPRS EDGE HSPA

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:57,200
family there's up there's a bunch of

00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:01,670
those and then LTE 3gpp2 has cdma 12

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:06,500
thousand evdo the now dead um B&Y faxes

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:08,930
wife XY max is quickly dying and because

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,250
basically sprint invested heavily in

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,760
that upfront and they are now

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,200
transitioning to to LTE these are the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,110
primary documents that you should

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
basically be aware of and i would just

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,760
recommend reading the first three if

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,010
you're interested it's not too difficult

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,230
that's probably 200 pages you know you

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,680
probably read longer books and 9th grade

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,840
right yeah yeah so these are you know

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,880
this is just a quick little collection

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,790
here we're going to zoom in here and

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,370
mostly we're going to be discussing 33

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:43,730
dot 401 and that is the specific version

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,130
that i use for this presentation this is

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,130
the primary LTE security architecture

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:53,600
document and you can for the most part

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,680
read the first 20 pages without much

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,710
difficulty and that's

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:01,190
where the most important portion is so

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,430
you know give it a quick look it's

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,420
really confusing to to to download these

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,270
standards FYI they're going to be

00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,070
downloaded in a's a zip file and that's

00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,630
the only way answer then double click on

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,760
that and then open it up it's super

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,860
awful so just FYI with some instructions

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,660
so here's the big picture in case you

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,230
you like really haven't looked at

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,930
cellular networks before so mobile

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,470
devices connect to a base station which

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:33,140
is those giant and and and antennas in

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:36,589
the sky which connects to a core network

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,020
which is basically run by verizon AT&T

00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,839
sprint which then you know connects to

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,980
the internet or or other cellular

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:51,279
networks or or the the public switched

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:54,500
telephone network the portion between

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,589
just the base stations is called the

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,910
radio access network the iran and you're

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:02,650
going to see that term kind of be

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:07,310
evolved there is a G ran a you Tran and

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:09,260
EU Tran and so r and you know just just

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,430
just be be aware of that that is a a

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,260
collection of basically base stations as

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,529
we said base stations are permanent

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,610
cellular sites often times they are

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,440
disguised which is kind of funny when

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,370
you find one of one of those they

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,080
sometimes look like rocks or like they

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,360
like put trees around them so you don't

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,520
really know that they're there sometimes

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,560
they can you know run off of gas like

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,520
gasoline if they're like like way high

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,100
up in the the the mountains it's just

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,800
you know interesting when you when you

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,690
come across one next time you do take

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,360
you know take a look and just you know

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:51,610
look at the different types of locks and

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,839
just be aware so base stations sometimes

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:59,600
co-locate different carriers on the same

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,600
base station so you might have 80 AT&T

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,610
buying time from Sprint or a buying time

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,700
or space from

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:10,010
of verizon so a base station doesn't

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,470
necessarily have to be just one one

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,540
company and base stations are often well

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,029
base stations are connected back to the

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,250
the core network via a link called the

00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,440
backhaul kind of pointed to it there and

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,079
that backhaul interface sometimes is a

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,279
fiber sometimes it's satellite sometimes

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:32,630
it's microwave it all depends on what

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,790
sorry most definitely t1 yep it's it's

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,200
basically however we can get the

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,130
information from the base station back

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:43,640
to the core network mobile devices your

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,589
your typical mobile device and whenever

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,300
someone talks about mobile devices they

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,070
want to take out there a phone and show

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,540
you right and I really want to right now

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,680
for some reason I know you all know what

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,870
a freaking phone looks like so my my

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,220
mobile device has anywhere from like

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:05,120
four to six different radios in it you

00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,880
know Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth you know

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,360
possibly a bunch of different cellular

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:17,029
radios and so just just kind of be be

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:22,100
aware of that um in in LTE terms bless

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:26,779
you a phone is called a ue a user

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:31,519
equipment and this this user equipment

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:36,250
has a a UIC see which is often thought

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:39,440
of as a semi am a sim card this this

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,800
this a UICC is actually running an

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,760
application on top of it called the the

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,980
the the you sim and so that's just sort

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,329
of a big difference from a couple years

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,190
back sim and um are kind of used

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:58,209
interchangeably but they are very very

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,589
different nowadays subscriber identity

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,360
MC you've probably heard this when

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:06,320
you're basically hearing about stingrays

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,649
or you know MC catchers MC is basically

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,690
you're on the cellular network it is

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:17,680
your personal identity it defines who

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:20,680
you are it is a 15 digit number

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,370
stored on the the sim card or you sim

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,339
card whatever it consists of three of

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:30,029
values mcc MNC msi n we'll take a look

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:33,850
at that in a moment a lot of times

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:35,110
carriers try not to send the mcs over

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,540
the over the air if they don't if they

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,410
don't have to and so they'll use a

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,459
temporary identity called a guti I don't

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,510
know if that's how it's said that's how

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:49,180
I say it in my head a globally unique

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,830
uuue identity or a Tim see again I'm not

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,120
sure if that's how it's said temporary

00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:56,380
mobile subscriber identity and these are

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,730
all different from your actual phone

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,770
number right your actual msisdn this is

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,410
what an AMC looks like and how its kind

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:08,890
of broken up it's just interesting to

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,899
note that a Europe may use a two digit

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:15,520
value for the second thing there for the

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:18,070
the second range yeah this is what the

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:23,290
you know just this is what all the fuss

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:25,959
is about hum but I have anyway so ue

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:30,130
identity your actual phone has its own

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:33,089
identity called the actual imei the

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:36,790
International Mobile Equipment Identity

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:39,580
it is a 16-digit number you can actually

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,400
look at it right now by doing pound hash

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:46,209
06 hash on your phone and it'll it'll

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,810
probably pop right up for our our sorry

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:53,050
sorry star hash 06 hash my bad don't

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,990
want to confuse our British friends and

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:59,260
the actual imei is often used most often

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,650
used to to blacklist phones from a

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:06,400
cellular network so so if someone steals

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:08,500
your phone they can blacklist AT&T can

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,160
can can blacklist that phone from

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,890
getting on their network it is um it is

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,650
illegal to change a phone's IMEI and

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:22,150
many in many countries for that reason I

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,970
don't know about our country you sim

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,160
cards these are basically and if if what

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,260
if what I read is true this is the

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,940
single most popular smart card and the

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,190
whole were

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,899
old / 7 over 7 billion in circulation

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,669
they actually store cryptographic keys I

00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:39,929
mean that's their primary duty here

00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:43,679
right is they are long-term

00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:47,340
cryptographic key storage in a secure

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,750
area they do house a processor that

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:54,090
actually runs an operating system and

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,809
and on on top of this operating system

00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,840
there is a stripped stripped-down mobile

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:05,519
mobile version of the the Java Virtual

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,409
Machine that is used and and and and it

00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,899
can actually run apps like you can run

00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:12,720
games off your s ehre your sim card

00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:18,870
which is kind of cool and will totally

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,460
not be misused by anyone ever yeah and

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,529
like we were sent here sims are

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,490
deprecated the modern term is used sim

00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:29,610
so you may remember cdma did so

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,710
basically a verizon used a soft sim they

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,960
have now basically you know made this

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,559
huge change in their a network and they

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,750
are now using a you know hard Sims now

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,759
and Sprint is changing from my mac

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,470
stealthy already went over that here's

00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,419
what the sim card looks like there are a

00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,460
bunch of different types right um we're

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,279
really just removing plastic for them

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,220
for the most part here in this picture

00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:55,860
the the the yeah remove plastic I don't

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,590
know what that means um so the actual

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:02,179
metal part is more or less the same the

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:08,159
contacts are a little bit different oh I

00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:09,809
Sims if you if you roll in Android you

00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,029
are probably using a micro sim if you

00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:14,549
roll and iPhone you're probably using a

00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:18,240
nano-sim makes it real hard to go back

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,620
and forth so LTE networking here's

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,309
here's what we're really here for

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,470
remember it's a 4G data and voice tech

00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:27,769
technology it's basically split into

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,690
three different portions any LTE network

00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:36,240
the actual radio network which is called

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,009
the ve yu Tran I don't want to try and

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,759
go for that giant acronym the actual

00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:43,210
core network the the evolved packet core

00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:48,940
and the the

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:50,830
the IP multi multimedia subsystem we're

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,600
not going to talk about the IMS because

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,149
it's kind of confusing and we don't have

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,230
enough time here and if anyone has any

00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:01,929
questions you know stop me let me know

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,640
so we're we are really going to focus on

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:06,279
the interaction between the the actual

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,529
phone and a base station I know this

00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,270
looks awful and horrible let's talk

00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:11,950
about it for a moment and then we'll go

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:16,480
into a nice pretty picture I promise

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:21,039
okay so the actual ue is the LTE device

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:24,419
in LTE parlance base stations are called

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:28,510
evolved node bees which is an awful name

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,740
so i know'd bees or eaten bees you will

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,360
see it written three or four different

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,740
different ways just just just know

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,380
anything with a be on the end it's

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,350
probably a base station that's just you

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,289
know so the the mobility management

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,299
entity Mme this is a really important

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:47,380
box on the core network it is it is a

00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:49,570
server that is um that is basically

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,760
doing all of the authentication

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,890
functions and all of the Kindle like all

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,169
the different control signaling allowing

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,390
you on the the network saying you know

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:02,620
you can go here can't go there the

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:06,070
serving the serving gateway is the it's

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,140
it's basically the main route that user

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:12,190
data passes through it's just it's just

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:16,000
another server on the network it does do

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:19,500
handoff between other 3gpp networks and

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,169
so if you're going from AT&T LTE to

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,090
verizon LTE then if if there was a

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:27,190
handoff that had to be done because

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,659
you're going down a highway at 60 miles

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,880
an hour and you have to switch from this

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,820
from this base station to this base

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,429
station then that actual handoff would

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,669
would occur at the SD as the serving

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:42,159
gateway the the packet gateway the p

00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,710
gateway allocates IP addresses and so

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,980
yeah all your phones have have nice IP

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:52,000
addresses now that none now that you're

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,820
on LTE the p gateway does handoff

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,070
between LTE oh sorry between 3gpp

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,169
networks and non 3gpp network

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:03,190
so if you were trimmed like if you were

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:06,460
handing off from AT&T LTE to verizon

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:09,100
cdma then that actual handoff would

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,169
occur from from the P gateway the home

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,630
subscriber server and the authentication

00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:16,659
center the difference between these are

00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,769
very minut I don't even talk about it I

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:21,490
just kind of mentioned them in the same

00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:24,669
thing they actually reside on the the

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,399
enemy and they they actually hold your

00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:30,580
long term cryptographic key k well we'll

00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:32,860
get into that and the actual MC and then

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,259
I ms which is kind of confusing we're

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,929
not going to talk about that so here you

00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:39,309
can see we have the the phone and

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:41,889
through some awesome lightning bolt

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,500
graphic there it goes to the the base

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:47,470
station from the the base station

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,649
control signaling is routed from the

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,610
base station to the enemy and as like

00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,649
this is where all your all your

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,750
authentication information is stored at

00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:59,889
and the serving gateway is where all

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,570
your user data is is put through and so

00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:07,029
from here we would go out to the

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:09,850
internet or the the PSTN and this is

00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:12,250
just a really basic LTE network was not

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,240
really mini you know there's not much to

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:20,259
know here which is which is nice right

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:24,190
so for communication between the phone

00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:26,019
and the and the and the e node B and

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,509
then the core there are there are

00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:31,149
cellular specific protocols as you might

00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:32,980
as you might as you might imagine it

00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:36,789
it's it's a cellular version of tcp/ip

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:40,240
right and in reality tcp/ip actually is

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:43,149
no runs on on top of all of all of this

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,200
which is which is which is nice um so

00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:46,299
we're going to we're going to take a

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,950
look at some of these protocols here

00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:53,320
let's zoom in on the far left side so

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,389
LTE uses different communica munications

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,320
planes prime primarily you should just

00:23:55,389 --> 00:24:02,559
think of three you have a communica

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,139
munications plane for user data my phone

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,970
to the base station to the court to the

00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:09,250
core to the core network that could be

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,880
voice or whatever you're looking at

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,610
there is control

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,370
signaling between your phone and the

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,140
base station right because the base

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,330
station has to know where your your

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,760
phone is it has they get tracking area

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,880
updates it has to you know do all that

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,800
authentication it has to say hey you're

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,490
being a little bit loud simmer down

00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,560
right um and you know there's actual

00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,390
control signaling for that and then

00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:40,280
there has to be control signaling from

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:42,610
your phone to the core network and so

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:49,040
there's that's basically three distinct

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:52,540
planes here cool uh so we're going to

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,050
look at for a moment these three bottom

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:58,550
these three bottom ones so our RC

00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,190
basically provides control signaling

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,680
between the phone and the e node B the

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:07,520
PDC p protocol packet data convergence

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,820
protocol does encryption and and it

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,830
actually gets like a it basically takes

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,690
all these the signaling above it and

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,230
then encapsulate sand then frankly just

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:24,890
you know encrypts it or or or integrity

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:26,570
protects it the the the RLC it actually

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,580
readies readies packets to be

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,830
transferred over the air interface and

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,630
then the actual Mac layer does

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:36,310
multiplexing and quality of service and

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:39,640
then physical you actually have you know

00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:42,080
electronic bless you electronic

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,920
transmissions you know gallivanting over

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,410
the airwaves so here are the control

00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,110
protocols and and and a lot of these

00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,730
protocols are sort of repeated here and

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,760
that's and that's fine it's just how the

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,250
standards documents explain it so you

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,520
have the the control protocols which is

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:04,610
an ass security which is the which is a

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,000
non access stratum super confusing name

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,160
it connects you're like this is that a

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,770
control signaling plane from your phone

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,720
back to the core network and then you

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,700
see our RC there which is control

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,280
signaling from your phone to the actual

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,830
base station and then simply simplified

00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,980
much more is where is what your your

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:28,090
data would would traverses

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,850
these four protocols here interfaces

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,190
that nice diagram that we had earlier

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,110
every single thing like every single

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,210
interface every single connection

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:44,470
between between a server or a network

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,330
component has its own unique identifier

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:51,179
basically and here are the main ones

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:53,679
that I want you to know for LTE so in

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,350
requirements will say things like the

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,080
actual yeah it'll say the x2 interface

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,210
which is between between two base

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,850
stations the x2 interface has to you

00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,370
know has to have this much encryption or

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,860
you know has to be protected by these by

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,270
these means and so what you really need

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,460
to pay attention to is what's going to

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:18,549
confuse you is the is the s-1 interface

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,870
has to has two separate interfaces I

00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:23,559
don't want it they just didn't call them

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:27,419
two different s 1 and s 2 so the actual

00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:30,190
s 1 mm II is the the control plane

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:32,290
signaling interface and then the s1 you

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,250
is the user plane inner is the user

00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:38,679
plane information in an interface

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:41,410
security what we're all here for so

00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,890
there are a couple of different security

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:47,460
mechanisms in use here the actual um

00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:50,410
token right the actual hardware token

00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,929
authentication and key agreement which

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,730
is how your phone gets gets

00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:57,220
authenticated onto the the the network

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,919
and that's really what what what a lot

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,809
of um a lot of people that say black hat

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,150
and DEF CON have been you know breaking

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:08,080
over over years passed and then we have

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,610
crypto LTE you know has its own like

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,080
basically has its own encryption and

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:16,169
integrity cryptographic algorithms so

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,760
we're gonna talk a little bit about that

00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:20,830
high level threats to LTE there is a

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,419
document and it's one of those TRS and

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,190
you should probably go take a look at it

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:27,010
and just just sort of talks about stuff

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,530
we are worried about it was the the LTE

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:32,130
designers and so these are some of the

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,900
things here right tracking tracking

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,929
identity physical physical attacks on

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:42,700
base stations manipulating country

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:45,039
plain or user plane data threats to like

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,320
basically how there are like downgrade

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,809
attacks in SSL there are you know

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,240
downgrade attacks exist in cellular

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,730
networks as well Tino push you into

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,820
using a week or cipher and then you know

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,279
jamming it is you know an open an open

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,409
interface and so on it's interesting to

00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,039
note that jamming is not within the

00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:10,119
threat model of LTE and you can you can

00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:12,850
basically acquire jammers for like 40 40

00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,299
bucks on ebay from you know they'll have

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,190
some Russian characters on the packages

00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:19,990
but uh yeah so it's just interesting to

00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,909
know that they are not trying to prove

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,539
protect against this and mentally it's a

00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:28,149
really hard hard hard problem so low

00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:31,960
level threats right i mean basically

00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:35,139
since it is open there is a sorry

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,090
because the the air interface is open

00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,309
there are um like you can basically

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,369
sniff the the traffic possibly or do

00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:44,950
jamming attacks sim cloning this used to

00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,749
be a way bigger problem where you would

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,309
either steal someone's phone and copy

00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:51,999
their sim their sim card and then

00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:54,419
basically use their their their account

00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:58,059
to make long-distance phone calls right

00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:02,049
and nowadays more of an issue is really

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:05,889
people people cloning their their their

00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:07,480
own phone and then and then using like

00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:09,279
using using that to spread out their

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,690
wireless service to multiple to multiple

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,490
people basically have want to have one

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,779
accountant you know ten different 10

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,899
different 10 different lines basically

00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:18,100
right and I really even that I like even

00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,929
that I don't leave it like I don't see

00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,230
that much of that happening threats to a

00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:24,850
privacy by design I mean your phone

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,139
knows where you are at all times or at

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:32,529
the very at the very least if you are

00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:34,299
like your relation like your location in

00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:36,309
relation to a base station right i mean

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,200
if if your phone can talk to a base

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,690
station you're within some minimum some

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,210
minimum distance between a unique base

00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,539
station and as we're saying now like

00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:48,879
basically sprint and AT&T and Verizon

00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,619
they have to operate this massive IP

00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:51,590
based network now with you know

00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,659
basically servers all

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,159
on the internet that's going to be a

00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:59,179
little bit a little bit different from

00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:03,200
from from before so the actual hardware

00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:06,320
token you sim UICC it is more or less

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,720
identical to what it was in um TS which

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,770
is 33 g it actually points to the same

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:16,340
standard so just as hey look that way it

00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:21,049
uses an l sorry LTE uses a new hardware

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:23,380
protected 128-bit key called k and k is

00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:26,110
just really really like really really

00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:29,679
important you need to look into k um

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:33,500
basically all keys are derived from k

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:37,970
session Keys long term keys whatever and

00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:40,370
K never leaves your phone ever k k is is

00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:43,340
basically instantiated or sorry k is

00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,500
derived or you know generated and then

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,440
it is basically stored in the core

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,350
network at the enemy and inside of a sim

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:58,700
card and other than that it is it is

00:31:51,350 --> 00:32:01,010
never it is never released so um a at a

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:05,840
nice segue okay yeah so one of the main

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:07,700
points of this key k is for aka aka you

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,500
know authentication and key and key

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,630
agreement this is how subscribers are

00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:15,679
authenticated to to a cellular network

00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,929
so it's basically a crypt a

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,590
cryptographic protocol it's originally

00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:25,399
specified and that standard previous

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,559
versions of of AKA did not do mutual

00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:29,360
often often it off an authentication and

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,240
that's the big deal here is that is that

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,059
LTE actually ties the name of the

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,640
serving network so it ties the name of

00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,860
basically verizon's network into the AKA

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,460
protocol and so you are actually

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:47,960
authenticating both sides you're yeah

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,370
yeah an aka again this is confusing

00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,760
we'll just talk about it for a second of

00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,140
a look at the diagram AKA uses

00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,260
authentication vectors it's basically

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,530
the main primitive inside of a ka and

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,730
it's just a bunch of different a bunch

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:07,030
of different security parameters

00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:09,400
uh there's a baby a bunch of them but

00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,410
basically and an authentic

00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,230
authentication vector consists of a

00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:16,840
response and aut in I don't know how

00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:22,530
people say that authentication out in a

00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:25,060
nonce a random number and then a local a

00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:29,410
session master key is how we will call

00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:31,990
that and that is qasmi or k as me so

00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:33,490
it's actually not too bad though this is

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,220
a simplified version it doesn't have any

00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:38,170
of the of the error mechanism sink in

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,020
case things go wrong in it but basically

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:44,440
you have your phone with the with the UM

00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:46,540
on the left and on the right you have

00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,970
the core network which which has access

00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,010
to the HSS and and often often an

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:54,040
authentication center you can see at the

00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:56,710
top at the top left and top right both

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,830
sides have access to the M C and K and

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:02,290
so what really goes on is that your

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,690
phone sends either a temporary identity

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,480
or or the MC over over the air interface

00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,610
to the core network that's the the top

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,450
thing there the second step is that the

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:15,460
enemy receives that information looks it

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:18,670
up and sins and sends that information

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,820
to the to the authentication center

00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:25,240
cryptographic magic happens we're

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,370
basically on the the MC and K and the

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,800
serving network ID all basically

00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:32,370
generate a couple of different cryptid

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,550
crypto cryptographic parameters

00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:39,520
specifically these the the the reefs

00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:43,060
priests response and the end the session

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,080
key and only that information sorry this

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,030
whole authentic authentic authentic

00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,900
Asian vector is sent to to the enemy and

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:52,600
then only the the nonce and the and the

00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,960
authentic often an authentication token

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,720
I still forget what what a what a what a

00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,490
you t n stands for that is all sent to

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,130
your SIM card your SIM card does

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,560
basically a very very similar process as

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:10,000
what as what goes on here to to

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,370
basically generate a signed response and

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,200
that signed response is then sent over

00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,540
to the enemy at the core network and if

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,590
this and at this and if this expected

00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,150
response

00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,400
is equivalent to the signed response

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:48,190
then someone is authenticated to the

00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:50,950
network yes sir they definitely do so it

00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:53,860
that uh so I'm just because I it's

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,590
confusing how networks are laid out but

00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:59,320
but uh basically it's not it's not all

00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:02,320
your eggs in one in one basket there are

00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,270
there are yeah there are basically

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,400
multiple baskets I'm not exactly sure

00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:12,070
how say you know AT&T lays out it's it's

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,460
a it's often often occasion centers but

00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,500
I would assume this is a complete josh

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,990
assumption here that there is basically

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,890
you know maybe a North Carolina

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,590
authentication center and there's a

00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:26,470
Washington DC and then there's a new New

00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:29,230
Jersey I have no idea um I just don't

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:32,890
have access to that into to that

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,020
information but but basically yes if it

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,590
is all in one in one and one basket and

00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,590
there's a leak

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,960
yeah yeah I've actually I've actually

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,080
wondered about that myself and this is

00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,860
just a another Josh thought maybe they

00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:07,410
are like maybe it was just because the

00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,200
network was built in you know late late

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,390
late late 80s Early 90s and they used

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,850
symmetric crypto up up front or maybe

00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,860
phones have to basically authenticate a

00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,760
lot and you know asymmetric cryptos much

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,960
more sorry is you know not not very

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,790
efficient um again that's just like

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,970
that's just a guess on my part that's a

00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:29,190
good observation um um so yeah that's

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,980
how that's how you know your phone gets

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:34,220
onto its network and earlier versions of

00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,720
this are like they look basically

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,910
similar to this it's just some of the

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,810
the acronyms are different and that uh

00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:46,710
that uh that s nid and that nonce might

00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,119
not be there so we don't have time to go

00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,040
over this i'm running a little bit slow

00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,750
but there is this is the the

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,840
cryptographic operation that is that is

00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:57,990
used to generate the the authentic

00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,170
authentication vectors it is a

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:04,140
standardized algorithm but it but of the

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:06,630
3gpp standards don't say that you have

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,240
to actually use it because someone like

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,740
because verizon actually owns basically

00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,990
your SIM card and they owned the core

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,690
network they can actually use we know

00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:18,000
whatever key generation and key their

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,560
rate derivation algorithms they want to

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,330
because they on both sides and so as

00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,340
long as it works with him then their

00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,950
their their network it's not a big big

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,080
deal and this standardized algorithm is

00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,030
french is called Mila Nagy I hope I'm

00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,790
not hurting that you know hurting

00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:34,980
someones ears real real bad and this is

00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:37,350
what this is the actual um verification

00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,609
I mainly made these diagrams because the

00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,990
ones inside of these standards were

00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:42,150
super ugly and these ones you can just

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:45,930
take and do whatever you want with with

00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,900
them your yourself so yeah the power

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:52,340
point is all is all is completely

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,600
available so LTE crypto cryptographic

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,150
algorithms used for you used for

00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,600
basically a conf conf confidentiality

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,290
and integrity protection this was

00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,300
there's like a

00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:07,620
like a long super fun history here right

00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:10,830
like basically originally with gsm

00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:13,440
networks trying to trying to remember

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:17,640
exactly how how it went it was going to

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,590
be 64 bits was how far the original like

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,320
how long the original GSN key was going

00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,390
to be but then the West Germans were

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,490
really were really worried about the

00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:30,210
East Germans and Britain's didn't trust

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:33,060
anyone's sorry anyone and it eventually

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:35,610
kind of got nerfed and the this the same

00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,610
way des did and so it's a GSM had a 56

00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:42,330
bit key basically with like eight eight

00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:47,220
eight eight bits of padding but in LTE

00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:49,410
we do have 128 bit and 256-bit keys and

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,640
these are these are fairly robust

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,410
algorithms they are standardized

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,390
algorithms you can go and look in and

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:57,990
see exactly how they are they are they

00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,670
are being employed affined not how they

00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,730
are implemented these are all open

00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:04,920
standards basically have e EA which is

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,650
in you know encryption algorithm one and

00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,990
then EIA which is you know integrity

00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:13,260
algorithm one and they're a bit they're

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:16,710
both based on snow 3 3g which is a UMTS

00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,600
algorithm and then the the US and you

00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,500
know be me being from NIST and you know

00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:25,580
our history with AES and all that the

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,490
u.s. uses like the u.s. basically got a

00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:31,950
AES inside of the 3gpp standard so

00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:35,610
basically you have e ee a 2 in E I a two

00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:41,250
are basically a esnc CTR mode and then

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:43,170
you know AES cbc-mac and then China was

00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,210
kind of perturbed about this and so they

00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,040
decided that they that they that they

00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,540
wanted their own corrupt you know their

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,150
own a girl gorillas meeeeee and so now

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,760
zouk is currently being standardized and

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,350
it should be to my knowledge it's not

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,790
implemented but that doesn't mean much

00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:59,000
because i don't know i don't know

00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:03,720
anything about LTE networks in china um

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,110
yeah so I just I just don't and if I did

00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:11,070
that would probably not be safe so right

00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:15,420
now most keys in LTE are 256 bits bits

00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:19,470
long but unfortunately only one

00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:21,569
like there's basically 128 bits of zeros

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,390
and a lot of them but that is being

00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:26,400
quickly changed and you know everyone's

00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:30,569
being proactive about that just you know

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,770
FYI so here's what I kind of promised

00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:33,780
right we're going to dip into the

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,900
standards and I'm really going slow I

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,760
thought anyway um so these are the three

00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,549
different standardized algorithms and

00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,460
what it says here is that um is that a

00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:49,740
es and snow 3g have to be sub sub

00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:51,690
supported but zouk is you know you don't

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,400
actually have to support zouk which is

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,589
which is interesting i don't know if

00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,230
that's going to change in the future if

00:41:55,589 --> 00:42:00,480
you know basically verizon an 80 if a

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:09,180
verizon and AT&T will have to support a

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:13,020
chinese cipher sorry yeah it might be

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,079
built in right yeah so the key the key

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,329
hierarchy and LTE it's a little bit

00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:20,460
confusing but um basically you have K

00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:22,470
which again is only stored in core

00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,770
network and Sam and you have ck and I k

00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:28,230
which are basically derived from from k

00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:31,230
and they are basically stored in in the

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,549
HSS and then the phone itself but then

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:36,780
you get into the actual meat of it with

00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:39,510
kaz me and k a sm e and this is the this

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,950
is the the the local master key and so

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,960
basically all these other keys are

00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,990
derived from Academy for the for the

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,150
most part and there's there's so many

00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,670
it's crazy I should have put a picture

00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,440
of what the the the standard looks like

00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,059
it looks like the most confusing circuit

00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,700
diagram you've ever seen if you're

00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:59,549
looking at how up like it what the the

00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,020
Kia hierarchy looks at looks like you

00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:02,910
should actually go in and look at it it

00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,710
is very very comical and what you're

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,000
what you what you see here is that you

00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,000
have different keys for different

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,319
purposes which is great but then you

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,420
start to have different keys for

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,140
different protocols which is even cooler

00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:19,380
you have KRR siento i'm just do if KR

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,640
zie end here and the KRC in encryption

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,040
here so you have a different key for

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,829
both encryption and and integrity and

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,410
you have the the same thing here for an

00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:30,030
ass

00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:33,069
the non access stratum control signaling

00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:35,650
here's a sweet little chart I found

00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:38,230
online and i reproved pro who produced

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,030
and I totally cited them but um I really

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,950
like this because it just shows all of

00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,609
the different main keys and their

00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:48,160
strengths real real fast so signaling

00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:52,960
protection what it's actually encrypted

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,609
inside of LTE so as we were saying you

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,410
know different different community

00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:58,510
communication paths have their own have

00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:00,940
their own keys and a common claim and

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:04,930
this is what really perturbed me i will

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:06,670
say that word um is that a LTE is fully

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,760
encrypted I've seen this in like I

00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,250
Triple E articles I've seen this on on

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,280
just like all all across the internet

00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:17,710
and that may be true but it is not

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,630
mandated by the standards and so you're

00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,579
basically you're putting your faith in

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,950
what AT&T and Verizon and Sprint do and

00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:26,619
they may vary it like they may very well

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:32,289
encrypt everything I don't I don't know

00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:33,849
I yet but uh just I just I just like to

00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:35,799
you know say you know I camera this

00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:37,390
point this point this point home and

00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:39,670
this is just a cool little diagram shows

00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:42,220
you know which Keys different different

00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,380
different layers of the the protocol

00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,650
stacker actually are actually protected

00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,880
by so we talked about NASA security I'm

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,799
going to speed up a little bit we talked

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,010
about NASA circus security here being

00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:56,049
the the signaling beats between of the

00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,260
actual phone and the court the core the

00:44:56,049 --> 00:45:02,470
core network and and so that's called

00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:05,640
the non access stratum the green part is

00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:07,900
called the actual access stratum and

00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:12,220
they get protected with different with

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:17,140
different keys and then nds IP network

00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:19,210
domain system and / IP this is basically

00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,829
using IPSec in the court in the core the

00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,329
core network that's the standard if you

00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:24,819
want to read up on it that's like a five

00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:27,700
page standard it basically says you can

00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:32,920
use IPSec in a certain in a certain mode

00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:34,180
and then you can put security gateways

00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,819
which are just basically hardware

00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,950
hardware ipsec appliances on your your

00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:42,849
network of various points

00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:45,869
and this is not required either but to

00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:49,270
prove that here we go so NASA

00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:52,690
requirements so you see Nass signaling

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:56,230
confidentiality is an operator option so

00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,730
the control signaling is fairly

00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,990
important i would have I would have at

00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,579
least suspected that the that the

00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:04,329
control signaling would have been would

00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:07,089
have been encrypted and it says there

00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:08,320
you know note one rrc and a signaling

00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:11,680
confidentiality protection is

00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,240
recommended and a big a big reason for

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,339
this might be is that 3gpp standards

00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,869
have to be deployed worldwide right a

00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,880
minute they have to work in all in all

00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:22,119
countries and it all says such

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:28,720
situations rrc signaling confidentiality

00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:31,030
is an operator option and yeah the only

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,000
thing that's really mandated here in

00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:37,240
terms of cryptographic protection is in

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,010
is integrity so integrity protection and

00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,099
replay protection shall be provided to

00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:44,680
NASA IRC signaling which is interesting

00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:47,880
and yeah yeah so basically you can think

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,290
of it as the minimum and confidentiality

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,589
protection it and and there is there is

00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:57,060
a caveat that says that if you

00:46:53,589 --> 00:47:00,369
physically like if you don't physically

00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:03,520
protect your network devices then then

00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:05,200
you have to encrypt I haven't found much

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,140
about what physically protecting your

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,990
network devices means but if you want to

00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:13,180
go look at these these are the the like

00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:18,579
this is the standard and where you can

00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:20,380
find it before I wrap up home homie node

00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:21,609
B's I just wanted to let you guys know

00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,960
that these things exist that these are

00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:27,369
basically femtocells or or a doe cells

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,900
like these are just basically base

00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:34,780
stations in your your your your house MC

00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:38,290
MC catchers are typically some sort of

00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:40,900
femme toast femtocell what's interesting

00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:43,869
about the actual homie node b standard

00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,940
is that it says that uh that like that

00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:47,290
you have to have roots of trust and so

00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,970
basically you have to have you know like

00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,520
long-term cryptographic key storage

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:54,250
protected by a hardware on

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,860
as part of the home Nov no duh be and

00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,800
that secure boot must be done which is

00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,660
which is really really great yeah it's

00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,250
just interesting and then lawful

00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,230
interception just wanted to put this out

00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,030
there too I haven't fully investigated

00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,860
this yet but there are three different

00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,990
lawful interception standards that I'm

00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,150
aware of they're actually built into the

00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:17,340
the LTE standard sends basically as you

00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:19,690
can imagine so you know law law law

00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,090
enforcement bodies can you know get

00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:26,190
access to the the keys that were that

00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:30,520
were used to come to to encrypt

00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:32,470
someone's traffic hopefully this is

00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,190
being this is being done to UM to make

00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:39,040
it so it's it's it's done in the most

00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:41,350
secure way as possible one would hope

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,060
that like you wouldn't want lawful

00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,600
interception to basically make it to

00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:49,720
where it was really you know like the

00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:53,590
rest of the key structure was weak or or

00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:56,770
you know reduce the size of a a key so

00:48:53,590 --> 00:49:00,090
that's basically all I got LTE security

00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:02,440
is imperfect and crazy complicated and

00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:07,150
complicated things are all like always

00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:09,460
really really secure right so uh in

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:11,200
general integrity and replay protection

00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:14,770
are mandated not confidentiality

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,480
protection and just remember remember

00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,670
that standards provide the bare minimum

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,960
level of security that must be achieved

00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:26,590
um telcos may voluntary may Valen Valen

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,130
tara lee raise the their security it's

00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:32,380
hard to tell so thanks for having me

00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:34,510
here's some further reading if you want

00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,820
go to open security training got info

00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:40,960
and i just tweeted these slides with the

00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:42,070
with the b-sides CL CL CL t hashtag if

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,730
you want to take a look take a look at

00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,730
