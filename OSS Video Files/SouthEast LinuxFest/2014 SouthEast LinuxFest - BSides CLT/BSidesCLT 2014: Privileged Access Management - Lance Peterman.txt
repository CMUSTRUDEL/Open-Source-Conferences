testing testing okay sorry about that

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:13,679
anyway several elements of their talk I

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,970
think you'll find salient in here I hope

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,480
so I just give you a little bit about me

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,430
been an IT for about 21 years now so my

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,779
IT experience can officially drink

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,490
alcohol the last ten really have been an

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,980
infosec I would make an argument that it

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,260
was actually longer than that but not

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,710
really worth arguing focusing especially

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,510
in identity and access management

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,219
currently I'm the lead I am I say

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,719
evangelist I'll tell you why in a second

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,760
it's kind of a wishy-washy name but

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,760
there's a reason behind it for a fortune

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,980
100 pharma company you look me up on

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,390
LinkedIn you'll figure out who but I'm

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,430
also a volunteer high school speech and

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,110
debate coach don't read anything into

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,649
that that offers no warranty or

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,480
guarantee of my performance and of

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,340
course related to my company the

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,970
opinions expressed here or entirely my

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,729
own but the reason I call it an

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,490
evangelist is you know my job for my

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,590
company is to craft the strategy with an

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,000
identity and access management but it's

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,710
also to hopefully make people at my

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,840
company care about identity and access

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,220
management and hopefully by the end of

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,729
this presentation you'll be carrying as

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,159
well so a funny thing happened on the

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,140
way to this presentation I was sitting

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
in allen hicks keynote speech this

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,960
morning on data privacy when I receive a

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:39,270
text alert from bank of america my debit

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,790
card has been compromised funny you

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,979
should say that because that's the first

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,009
thing I thought was oh that's ironic

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,710
then I realized no it isn't it's a funny

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,570
coincidence but it wasn't ironic so

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,070
anyway I just thought i would share that

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,290
because i realized on my way out to the

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,390
car before i spent 30 minutes talking to

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,310
bank of america about it they found my

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,420
number on somebody's computer they don't

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,469
even know who the merchant is yet

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,659
because I haven't pulled my business

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,250
from them yet but you know they lock

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,680
down the car to everything's cool you

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,250
know but you know it it was certainly a

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,250
fitting a segue to and also give me an

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,550
introduction to this story so

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,430
so we're going to talk about what Pam is

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,440
why it's necessary talk about some

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,210
recent events and certainly the Gotham

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,280
guys have really done a nice job of

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,350
setting some of that I'm going to dive

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,300
into a little bit of some of the key

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,990
breaches related to privileged access

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,880
and then we'll talk about Pam as a

00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,220
program or a service we'll talk about

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,260
things like the actual practice of

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:46,230
privileged access management and it's a

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,210
very broad term how collaboration is

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,100
critical within that area and then we'll

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,780
look through some use cases and then

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,610
finally we'll look at how do you adopt a

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,480
pan program and some of the keys to

00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,870
success so first what is Pam it's not

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,290
that that's my blunt attempt at a joke

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,140
during most of this so privileged access

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,880
management is a broad spectrum sometimes

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,890
that term is interchange with privileged

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,900
identity management or privileged

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,520
account management I like privileged

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,530
access management because it's a little

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,410
bit more holistic and especially as a

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,360
practitioner depending upon the size of

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,160
the company that you're in you may look

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
at different opportunities within that

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,750
spectrum to leverage privileged access

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,250
management that may not necessarily rely

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,860
on tooling and I'll talk a little bit

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,790
more about that later but I'm not going

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,010
to read you guys these definitions

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,990
because I gotta slide full of you know

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,490
but basically we're looking at three

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,340
components to this privileged access

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,660
which is the elevated condition within a

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,520
system that lets you do the cool things

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,380
on a system the privileged account

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,510
obviously is the enabler behind that and

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,370
then the use of privileged accounts

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,160
should absolutely be managed within your

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,160
organization and some consultants out

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,930
there I am NOT one of them will tell you

00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,100
that really when you're doing identity

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,810
management you should wait a while

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,150
before you start tackling privileged

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,990
accounts as the Gotham data security

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,990
guys you know Sciences sorry explained

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,580
you should be doing it now and it

00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,950
doesn't mean that you have to boil the

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,880
ocean and try and do everything but you

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,340
should be trying to manage those

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,100
accounts today and just to give you an

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,419
example from a personal perspective how

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,360
many of you have a network router at

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,830
home hopefully everybody probably raises

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,229
their hand

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,849
if you have a computer with an admin

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,680
account at home you now have the

00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,900
authority to have a privileged access

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,129
management program at home just managing

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,530
to account so you probably have a

00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,849
password management tool right you log

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,199
those two accounts you get rid of the

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,539
default password you now have a

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,759
privileged access management program you

00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:45,110
multiply that times 95,000 workstations

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,479
that's a little bit of a different you

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,939
know endeavor but the point being is

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,180
that you can start simple with this and

00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:55,099
I'll reiterate that as we go on the

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,349
reason why this is so important in

00:04:55,099 --> 00:05:01,270
Gotham obviously demonstrated some of it

00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:04,129
is we've seen a bit of a shift in the

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,620
use of the Internet you know with bring

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,949
your own devices in consumerization of

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,909
IT our strategy for security is changing

00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,590
you know we're moving into a new world

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:18,020
the old world was you build a perimeter

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,460
defense you get a really great firewall

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,120
you throw in some nice intrusion

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,529
detection and prevention and you know

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,330
antivirus and whatnot you're good to go

00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:28,879
right most of the people in this room

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,710
probably say no and here's the reason

00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,180
why is that's really what your

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,740
environment looks like you know what

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,370
I'll say with respect to that is you

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,169
know especially with you know mobility

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,960
and bring your own device and things of

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,969
that nature the business whether it's

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,240
your customers whether its internal

00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:53,089
customers whether its users they're all

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,650
asking for access from everywhere so

00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,479
that means that you're having more rules

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,580
come in through those firewalls you're

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,259
getting less promiscuous in terms of

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,029
your intrusion detection in your IPS

00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,259
systems in terms of what you're willing

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,000
to detect because a lot of them would

00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,349
show up as false positives or you're

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,020
having to refine those rules become a

00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:11,080
lot more or less fuzzies so to speak and

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,460
that's the challenge that curtain

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,080
creates this and that's why we say

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,080
identity is the new perimeter I did not

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,440
invite thats it create that invent that

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,589
saying I apologize but I certainly find

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,229
it appropriate so what we're going to

00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,729
take a look at and I'll go through only

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,560
a few of these some of them will hit

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,479
closer to home than others small

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,270
breaches examples of how they tie into

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,560
privileged access management and and

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,750
hopefully what we can do moving forward

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,100
this probably resonates with a lot

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,450
people in this room because I suspect a

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,040
few of you may live in South Carolina

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,140
I'm not going to go into great detail

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,670
about what took place in that breach the

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,010
only thing I'll highlight is one of the

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,200
things that they identified in that

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,330
breach you know it was an apt type

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,890
attack where they SAT there and they

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,480
were promiscuous on the network looking

00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,940
for accounts you know just like the

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,170
Gotham guys talked about they were

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,150
looking for those credentials that were

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,770
easy to find what did they find they

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,860
found something as simple as a backup

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,360
account its sole task was to back up

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,500
data on their respective systems and

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,360
most people would look at that and go

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,230
that's not really a privileged account

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,270
is it yeah it is it gave them access to

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:20,060
37 terabytes worth of gigabytes sorry

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,940
were 70 for two gigabytes worth of data

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,790
that contained the data of all of the

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,070
taxpayers in South Carolina that's all

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,270
that account was so that's one of the

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,560
things that you want to consider when

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,780
you're looking at well what are my

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,010
privileged accounts those are some of

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,090
the ones that you want to take a look at

00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,100
and of course I have a little snarky

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,050
commentary at the end that you know in

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,020
exchange for the you know one of the

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,820
things that I thought was interesting

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,940
the gds guys talked about with respect

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,229
to the data breach investigation report

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,340
you know they estimated the cost of the

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:54,110
breach at one hundred eighty eight

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,910
dollars per person and that's a general

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,710
metric that's being used but what's the

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,200
cost to an individual who has their

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,250
identity stolen it's probably a little

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,050
higher than one hundred eighty eight

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,770
dollars that might buy you some you know

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,080
some identity theft service but you know

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,400
to be fair to the state of South

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,320
Carolina they're going to review whether

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,260
they're going to renew that service at

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,900
the end of the year but I you know

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,180
hopefully they'll let aside to take care

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,180
of their taxpayers Saudi Aramco is

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,680
another interesting example in the sense

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,979
that this is a different type of an

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,100
attack this was an insider attack and

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:33,050
the challenge Saudi Aramco had that a

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,300
lot of enterprises out there have is

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,229
when they build workstations they build

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,310
them all with the same admin password

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,200
somebody inside that company happen to

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,570
know what that password was guess what

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,690
they threw a Trojan on there and was

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:51,709
able to wipe out the disk drives of

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,130
30,000 pcs it's pretty disruptive you

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,230
know

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,580
wasn't as destructive as it was

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,320
originally believed they were able to

00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,540
recover a lot of the data because it was

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,230
on servers as well but it was highly

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,360
disruptive to the workforce and so that

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,340
brings in the idea of you know as I

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,550
mentioned earlier in the talk you know

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,440
look at your local admin passwords you

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,850
know and especially with Linux

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,610
practitioners one of the things you want

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,200
to avoid is using your base account if

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,490
you're sending email with that account

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,080
you shouldn't be elevating the

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,790
permissions of that account to do things

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,500
you should be using other credentials to

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,000
do that and that's one of the things

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,950
that would frustrate a pen tester

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,560
because if I capture my email account

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,630
guess what he's going to be able to do

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,370
it's an email I don't have any privilege

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,350
to access at my company that's native to

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,520
my network account they're all tied to

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,700
privileged accounts that we have a

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,810
system that we use to manage that

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,900
another good example of that for example

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,300
is if you manage an active directory

00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,010
forest at your company if you're using

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,000
your base network credentials that has

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,380
permissions as domain admin you really

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,050
need to consider segregating those

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,250
accounts because if somebody gets access

00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,810
to that account which could be had

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,580
through a basic phishing attack and

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:06,590
phishing attacks are just getting a

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,090
little creepily good you know you can

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,700
compromise your entire network by doing

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,930
that and I promise I'm not going to

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,890
spend the entire talk trying to scare

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,290
you ebay obviously you know we're moving

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,640
into the more recent weeks ebay

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,810
obviously had a breach and that was an

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,570
example of what I just talked about

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,430
where they did spear phishing attack

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,900
very targeted they did not just send it

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,970
out to everybody because what happens

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,190
when you send it up to everybody oh this

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,710
is a phishing attack they sent it out to

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,240
very specific IT users which you would

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,820
hope would be more savvy but they can

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,840
get caught just like anybody else and

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,400
they were able to capture some

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,780
credentials credentials that had

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,250
privileged access and that's how they

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,570
were able to compromise those accounts

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,510
and who knows that may have been how

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,220
they got my credit card number so that's

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,140
just another example now the other thing

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,480
and this is a critique I have a vivir

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,130
ebay actually technically has two factor

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,920
authentication available but it's tied

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,150
to the paypal service not surprising

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
that they want you to do all your

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,680
transactions so they keep your money as

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,690
long as possible but they do have it but

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,390
they don't make it publicly available

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,730
in a fashion that would have if these

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,800
credentials were compromised would have

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,000
allowed you to keep moving forward but

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,850
that's kind of a separate talk about

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,100
two-factor authentication and then

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,490
finally I just thought this one was

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,890
amusing and you guys may have heard

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,290
about this these Canadian teenagers that

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,460
found an old ATM manual online which of

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,490
course the manual says this is the

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,440
default password and shock of shocks a

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,310
bank actually still had the default

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,650
password on some of their ATMs and you

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,630
know that just again you know this I

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,940
guarantee you if that was my bank and I

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:50,330
don't think it was because I don't think

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,680
bank of Americas in Canada but if that

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,510
was my bank I'd be pulling on money out

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,270
of there pretty quick so that's just a

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,680
bad operational practice and that's one

00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,510
of the challenges that I'll talk about

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,450
with respect to the practice of

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,520
privileged access management is this has

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,200
to become part of your DNA this is not

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,940
because this is one of the struggles I

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,640
run into at my company we're rolling

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,140
this project out and they think it's oh

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,090
well I'll just get all my accounts on

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,220
there and I've done that isn't how it

00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,230
works every time because you know okay

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,730
well you're right when are you rolling

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,340
out another server oh I've got 10 on

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,050
order for tomorrow okay all of those

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,160
servers need to be secured in manage see

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,510
it's got to become part of your

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,070
operational practice and I'll talk a

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,170
little bit more about that in a second

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,850
but what is what does all of this tell

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,470
us first of all as you guys will

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:38,480
probably agree the threat landscape is

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,370
changing daily one of the things you

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,290
know that has been noted is that the

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,380
compromise of privileged credentials and

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,110
obviously GDS commented on this as well

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,640
is a key stage in nearly all attacks and

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,930
that came from the cyber sheath or

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,520
fourth day they phrase it a little bit

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,040
differently but they walk through the

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,290
life cycle of an apt and elevation of

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,670
privilege is like the fifth stage in

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,020
that and that's ultimately what you're

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,730
trying to do with respect to privileged

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,140
access management and that's why I call

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,670
it access management as opposed to

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:10,430
identity management because you gain

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:12,080
access through a variety of methods you

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,180
know as I mentioned this is a critical

00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,820
attack vector they've already mentioned

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,110
the verizon debe ir i definitely

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,310
recommend taking a look at it they

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,200
actually improved it concern

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,900
durably this year it was a little harder

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,510
to read in previous years and I think

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,279
they got some creative consultants to

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:31,430
really kind of jazz up and it's a lot

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,930
more readable now one of the things i

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,710
did find interesting and admittedly this

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:39,710
is from two years ago but a company

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,440
called cyber Ark whose one vendor in the

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,589
Panama space did a survey and they found

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,720
that forty-three percent of respondents

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:50,779
either didn't have a pen practice or

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,620
they weren't sure if they did which I

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,900
thought that was interesting if you

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,520
don't know if you have a pan practice

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:59,390
and these were like directors of IT that

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,690
were responding and reevaluate their job

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:06,620
role so let's talk about the practice of

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:08,690
privileged access management and like I

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,060
said a little bit earlier you can run

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,370
the spectrum of how you're doing this at

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,650
a smaller company the idea of going out

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,720
and buying an expensive product to vault

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:20,839
all your passwords may not be practical

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,900
and that's one of the reasons why i call

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,210
it the practice of pam because you can

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,060
do other things to introduce controls

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,980
that aren't real expensive typically

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,630
there's manpower which that may be an

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,070
issue by itself but you know that's

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,290
something you have to manage but

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,110
ultimately pam as a practice is designed

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,330
to answer basic questions who has this

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,940
elevated access to a system when was it

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,070
used where was it used from this is

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,040
especially useful for companies that

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,920
offshore or outsource some of their IT

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,000
services which is a very common practice

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,280
you may want to limit the use of that

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,830
account only to that organization and so

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,900
as part of your controls around that

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,400
account you may ensure that those users

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,800
are the only people that have access to

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,089
that credential and then finally what

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,589
was actually done and that's what we

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,850
call session logging and I'll talk a

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,070
little bit more about that when we get

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,350
to the use cases the other thing i want

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,440
to emphasize and this are a little bit

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,990
earlier the technology or the tooling is

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,050
only one part of the equation you know

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,180
as justin mentioned in the the pen

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,100
testing talk you know one of the things

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,620
that they're constantly doing is looking

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,010
through those nmap logs and adding the

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,750
human intelligence to how they're using

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,250
those services within that particular

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,770
work and that's exactly what a hacker is

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,510
going to do so within your enterprise

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,160
how you use those accounts are going to

00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,570
vary and as a result the controls that

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,090
you introduce are going to vary as well

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,880
and also take into consideration the

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,860
fact that people are also part of that

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,050
process in fact I saw an article last

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,670
night that talked about the human factor

00:15:51,050 --> 00:16:00,320
is the one that usually causes most

00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:02,270
breaches Pam is most assuredly a

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,350
collaborative effort and some of that

00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,180
may seem obvious because obviously

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,630
security has to work with the rest of IT

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,490
in the business to do that so while it

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,430
is self-evident how you interact with

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,960
them is important you know one of the

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,220
you know first you know the goal should

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,840
be to clean up all of your privileged

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,150
accounts but again trying to boil the

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,950
ocean can be a bit of a challenge the

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:29,390
other challenge is I got an email last

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:33,620
week that I appreciated his enthusiasm

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:35,450
but he basically asked me if I could

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,280
tell him all of the privileged accounts

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,020
that were in his division of the company

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,990
division had probably about fifteen

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:45,770
thousand users and probably about 800

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,089
systems and he was asking me if I could

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:51,440
tell him what all of his privileged

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:53,839
accounts for and you know I wind up

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,089
setting up a meeting with him to deliver

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,260
the bad news and that answer was no the

00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,520
good news was there were other people in

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,050
his in his division that we're

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,580
collecting that information but one of

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,850
the key things that comes out of this is

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,000
this is not an IT service where like a

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,350
pen tester type service where i'm going

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,670
to be doing perimeter security and

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,910
seeing if you guys are doing what you're

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,890
doing what I'm enabling as a security

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,680
professional are controls that I need

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,699
you to use and I'm also going to work

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,439
with you in a collaborative fashion

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,390
because I don't know how you use a lot

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,680
of those accounts I don't know how you

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,120
use those systems I don't even know a

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,850
lot of the applications that you are

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,170
using so I'm darn sure not going to know

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,580
what the privileged accounts are in that

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,230
particular area because it could be at

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,600
the application layer it could be at the

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,970
web layer it could be at the OS layer it

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,590
can be at the hardware layer so an

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,620
article the other day this motherboard

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,080
manufacturer apparently stored their

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,120
default passwords in clear text and all

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,710
you had to do to find out what

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,110
password was especially if it was the

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,640
default password was scanned on this

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,530
particular port and pulled this object

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,690
and even if they had done the smart

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,920
thing and changed their password if this

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,050
motherboard hadn't been patched they

00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,750
could very easily have had hardware

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,370
level access to a server and like i said

00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:09,140
i think it was about 30,000 servers that

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:11,000
were potentially compromised by that so

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,280
like i said earlier you know one of the

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,780
keys with respect to this is to make

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
privileged access management part of

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,080
your security DNA and not just within

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,250
your security organization and that's

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,880
where you know i talked about the

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,650
evangelical piece most of my time at

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,740
work is actually spent talking to the

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,240
business and helping them understand how

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,950
important privileged access management

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,900
is how to enable it within your

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,220
organization I'll sit down with them

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,620
with a particular system let's take a

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,390
look at you know each layer within the

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,100
OSI model and potentially how they could

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:46,490
be at risk especially for some of the

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:49,520
more sensitive areas so let's take a

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,480
look at some of the use cases for Pam

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,090
and these are by no means exhaustive but

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,710
these are the two biggest ones that i

00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,570
would encourage people to use especially

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,570
if they have the finances to afford the

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,160
tooling the first one looks at password

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,429
access and basically what i call this is

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,920
the vaulting use case and simply what it

00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:13,460
is is you may have a system that you

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:17,120
cannot you know access or record you

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,260
know either the RDP or telnet or SSH you

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,730
can't record what happens with that

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,740
privileged account a good example is

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,809
like a web application where you may

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,990
have an admin login to the web app and

00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:28,460
you can't record what they do ideally

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,080
and I think some of the vendors are

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,700
moving into this space they are

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,280
increasing the capabilities to do that

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,630
but let's assume that situation exists

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,760
and so this administrator of this

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,320
particular application logs into their

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,120
privileged access service and this is

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,520
designed to be generic there's no

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,690
product specific to this but they're

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,050
going to log into that privileged access

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,600
server they're going to discover okay I

00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,420
have 15 accounts that I have access to

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,620
he's going to check out that account and

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,510
it's going to copy that password into

00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,110
his keyboard buffer it can then go to

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,549
his website in

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,740
do what he needs to do from an

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,270
administrative function and then when he

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,620
closes out that application he goes back

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,600
into the Pam system and checks that

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,000
password back in what should happen in

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,950
that scenario is the Pam system will

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,540
then go out and change that password so

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,429
while he did have the password and his

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,429
keyboard buffer for a period of time

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,720
that password is no longer valid now you

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,400
have to be careful with that obviously

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,230
was like system type accounts because

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,820
you might wind up breaking something but

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,530
if it's specific to an admin user

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,630
account that's this is an effective way

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,160
of achieving some of those controls what

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,809
I'm not crazy about what this one is you

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,070
can't really record what happens you can

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,650
look in the background with respect to

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,200
the logs but it requires a little bit

00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,299
more effort the more elegant solution is

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,480
the one at the bottom related to session

00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,220
access or session recording what happens

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,960
there like it says you're going to log

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,220
into the Pam system again let's say he's

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,669
going to you know administer an essay p

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,440
account on linux back end of a box he's

00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,150
going to log into pam he's going to

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,040
select that system he's going to check

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:06,710
out that system which is going to

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,600
initialize in ssh session and that

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,910
session as soon as it's initialized

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,169
begins recording so you can have every

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,330
single keystroke that's taking place

00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,520
within that system the system will then

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,890
record that session it will basically

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,270
archive it once it completes and ideally

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,490
you keep it for as long as you need to

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,780
to sustain regulatory requirements but

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,820
the great thing about that system is

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,770
it's fully auditable you can know

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,150
exactly what's taking place especially

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,340
if you're offshoring some of those

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,630
capabilities you can know exactly what

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,490
they're doing and this isn't necessarily

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,870
from a security perspective you also

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,730
might find some bad operational

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,220
practices about why how they're moving

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,809
data and things of that nature that

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,549
might assist you in improving up

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:49,490
operationally some of the other Pam use

00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:52,640
cases that can exist one very common one

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:55,000
is script management and larger

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,830
enterprises or shoot even smaller ones

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,169
what happens frequently is you may have

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,270
a script that's designed to execute a

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,770
function and within that script

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,630
unfortunately is stored credentials that

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,200
probably have not been changed from the

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,750
time that they were created some of the

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,410
Pam tools out there and I won't name

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,290
because this is an offender

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,360
recommendation

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,690
some of the tools out there can actually

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,240
manage those credentials for you and how

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,340
they're executed and give you a lot more

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,510
control over that area the other thing

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,680
that you would typically do in that

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:30,720
script function area is lockdown who has

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,330
access to those scripts so again that's

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,400
another you know if you tilt the Pam

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,840
axis on its head you know that's another

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,960
control that you can put in place that

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,510
isn't necessarily related to tooling

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,710
I've already mentioned local workstation

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,630
admin management you know one of the

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,310
things that a lot of larger enterprises

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,470
are trying to do you know especially

00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,690
with Windows 7 and Windows 8 is you can

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:56,130
yank local admin access from the users

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,900
and one of the things that you can do in

00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,670
some cases this might be a little

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,620
expensive for smaller organizations is

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,080
you can put their local admin account on

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,910
the Pam tool and yeah if they need to

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,380
install software that's great you go to

00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,240
this service you check out the account

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,250
you go in you do what you need to do and

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,630
then you come back and check it in and

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,220
it changes the password for you that's

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,970
another way of securing it Saudi Aramco

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,160
would love that service right now

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,440
another you know this is one that you

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,720
can almost do a talk by itself but with

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,130
the move to the cloud and this is a

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,930
challenge for some of the vendors in

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,490
this space is how do you manage

00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,810
privileged accounts out in the cloud if

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,840
you don't necessarily have direct access

00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,220
for them from your network there are

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,500
some vendors that are specializing in

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,080
this space so they might be worthy of

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,210
consideration you know in other use

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,010
cases virtualization platforms so it's

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,540
not just all of the virtual pcs or

00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,330
virtual servers that you have on a host

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,520
you also have the root admin account on

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,830
the ESX devices or whatever

00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,320
virtualization platform you're using and

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,910
as I mentioned at the bottom look at all

00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,700
the hardware platforms you can look at

00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,620
the the routers you know if you're a

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,600
manufacturing company you've got tons of

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,400
skated devices that are probably out

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,010
there a lot of them are still running

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,570
with their default passwords as well

00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,000
hopefully they're air-gapped to prevent

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:14,550
problems but some of them may not be and

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,020
so you know like i said this list is not

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,100
meant to be exhaustive and one of the

00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,140
things that i would encourage you to

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,900
look at if you are working with anybody

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,220
on the this initiative is you know get

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,539
creative in terms of where you think

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,070
those accounts and controls could be

00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:31,679
so with respect to the adoption approach

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,929
it's broken out into two components one

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,980
is the pre engagement phase and this is

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:41,159
what we encourage I say we within my

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,380
operational duties what we try and do is

00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,520
we try and deliver a lot of information

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,650
well crafted for the business owner or

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,659
the application owner so that they can

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,400
begin to gather that information on

00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,220
their own so before they even start to

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,809
talk to us we may orient them with this

00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,190
is what a privileged account kind of

00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,809
looks like but it's a little bit of a

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,559
Jabberwock because it depending upon the

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,760
application it may look different so we

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,059
help them understand how you might look

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,740
for that do an inventory of those things

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:12,029
then do a prioritization because some of

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,980
the systems that you look at depending

00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:15,450
upon the data that's being stored it may

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,789
not be critical to you right now to

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,649
secure that particular system but if

00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:21,330
this contains the financial data of your

00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:25,140
company that's probably going to be one

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,419
of the first ones in line you know if

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,190
there is documentation of current access

00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,649
processes you certainly want to get that

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:35,610
what we have found is a lot of companies

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:36,899
the documentation what documentation so

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,750
you certainly want to encourage them to

00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:41,220
do that when possible take that list of

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,100
candidate systems you begin to

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,820
prioritize them and then hopefully you

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,010
know if they already have existing

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,270
processes you know look at revising them

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,399
because this is the opportunity we're

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,480
now delivering the potential of tooling

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,340
in the instance where it's going to be

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,990
used how can we optimize some of those

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,340
processes so that's getting again back

00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,320
to the idea that this isn't just about

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,480
hey we pushed a tool out you can use it

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,980
now and our secure there's an

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,809
opportunity to adjust those processes

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,309
that hopefully realizes some

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,659
efficiencies because one of the

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:09,630
challenges that you're going to get into

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:12,390
with adoption is if you just drop the

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:15,149
tool in and say use this it's going to

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,090
make their life harder how many IT

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:20,549
people want to make their life harder I

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,419
have yet to meet one the second phase is

00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:26,279
the engagement our onboarding stage

00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:28,080
that's where the security organization

00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,429
will sit down with the customer tell you

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,590
take a look at the inventory and the

00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,350
target systems set up a schedule for

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,899
deployment you know because there's a

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,370
good chance they manage a lot of

00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,460
Independent Systems and then they'll

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,419
start in a test environment

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,730
you certainly don't want to throw this

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,590
into production because you will run the

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,020
risk of breaking systems if you if you

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:49,149
don't do it properly so you know

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,970
definitely when you're acquiring a Pam

00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:54,159
tool set I would encourage you to

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,350
definitely create a test environment and

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,409
actually I what I encourage you to do is

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,909
don't put all of the dev test and

00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:03,700
production systems in your production

00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:05,470
environment put your tests and Devon

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,330
your test environment that way if what

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,679
you're breaking something in test people

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,820
don't tend to get is in as much of a

00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:14,080
panic and then finally once you've done

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,580
all that testing there's a good chance

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,750
you may update some of your processes

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,830
based on your experience with the

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,110
tooling because this is going to be the

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,510
time that the customer is going to get a

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,669
chance to use those tools and they may

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,710
make some suggestions and you may fire

00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:28,929
some suggestions back on how do you add

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,020
additional controls instead of maybe

00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:33,760
using a particular tool or other

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,169
potential updates to the processes and

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,789
then finally you're going to deploy into

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,710
production that's when you're going to

00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,210
get going to want to go into some type

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,049
of hyper care mode to make sure

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,779
everything's running as you expect so

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:48,220
what are the keys to success on this

00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,419
first one I mentioned it should be

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,340
somewhat obvious because one of the

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,470
first questions I get asked when we talk

00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,990
about privileged account management for

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,149
an organization is well where's my you

00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,919
know break the glass and in case of

00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:02,200
emergency because if your systems down I

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,580
can't get into my system it's the first

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,230
question that usually gets asked well

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,100
the answer to that is fault tolerance if

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:10,480
my system is always available and when I

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,090
say always available I'm not talking

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,649
five nines I'm you know if a systems

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,070
down for ten seconds they're going to

00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:20,710
survive because it's just access to that

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:24,899
system that may slow them down but you

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:28,000
must have a highly resilient deployment

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:31,029
the second piece and I cannot stress

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,500
this enough you must have senior

00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,779
leadership support within your company

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,940
and I know that says for a lot of

00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:39,730
different security initiatives but this

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,330
one in particular is extremely salient

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,919
because if you call up the manager of

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,889
your Linux administration team and you

00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,970
say hey Ted I've got this project I'm

00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:50,980
rolling out and we're going to be

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,580
enrolling all of the Linux systems into

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,160
this

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,600
and in the interim it's probably going

00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,280
to make your life a little harder and

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,440
it's going to slow you guys down a

00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,890
little bit he's going to say that's

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,480
great Lance I'm really busy with

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,100
projects right now so i'll probably get

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,020
you get back to you sometime in two

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:13,000
thousand and never in the second

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,620
component of this and this is true of a

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,060
lot of different areas but particularly

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,660
with respect to identity and access

00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:22,660
management if you can tie it policy it

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,190
gives you that cudgel when you walk into

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,450
the meeting if you need to use it

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:30,190
obviously you want to use the carrot

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:31,870
first before you bring the stick if you

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,850
can tie it to policy and have the senior

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:37,810
leadership management it will make your

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,400
adoption rate go up considerably because

00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:44,130
ultimately senior leadership is saying

00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:46,000
guess what this is an optional and then

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,060
you know I've mentioned this before

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,010
focus on the process first have the

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,470
tooling in mind as a component within

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:57,310
the process but you know focus on the

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,930
process first be creative your

00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,550
organization is is different from other

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,680
organizations obviously you have a lot

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,750
of the same pain points but how you use

00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,160
data how you use accounts is going to

00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,480
vary within the organization so be

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,600
creative in terms of how you create

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,910
those controls when you are selecting a

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,680
vendor as i mentioned consider the cloud

00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:18,100
implications challenge them on how

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,570
they're tackling cloud infrastructure to

00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,340
ensure the church you know the service

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,510
that you're acquiring can take that into

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,880
account because if it can't and you're

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,800
leveraging heavily on the cloud you

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,040
might be falling short of the value

00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,540
realized in the product you select i

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,700
also recommend highly eating your own

00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,830
dog food first that's true of most IT

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,470
initiatives but start with your own key

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,430
privileged accounts within your team

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,750
that's one of the things that we did and

00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,150
we've got a lot of things we did like

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,350
about the tool we bought so we went up

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,820
i'm gonna go back to the vendor and go

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,020
you know how do we account for this and

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,630
it required that we start getting

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,040
creative with some of our controls and

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,600
that was knowledge that we could pass on

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,910
to the business when we engage them and

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,460
then finally and i mentioned this a

00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,680
little bit earlier don't think you're

00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,290
too small for this you may be at a

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,050
company of 50 employees and have you

00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,420
know a minimal of IT infrastructure

00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,860
that doesn't mean there are aspects of

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,150
privileged access management you can't

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,100
be doing today to help protect your

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,930
company because I guarantee you there

00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,730
cost for a hit is it going to be a lot

00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,460
bigger than the cost that ebay sustains

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,080
in terms of its impact ebay may be

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,160
saying okay you know we're going to take

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,170
a hit for three hundred million dollars

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,870
well when there are 12 billion dollar

00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:26,850
company that's a drop in the bucket but

00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,190
for a smaller company that maybe is only

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,570
40 million in business you know that's a

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,860
much bigger impact that they could be

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:37,170
taking on I kind of blew through the

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,370
slides a little bit but I definitely

00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,940
wanted to leave a lot of time for

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,940
questions so

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,789
yes sir

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,789
technicians that are out

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,559
there are tools I mean that that's part

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,300
of the vaulting capability that you'll

00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,370
find pretty much across the spectrum

00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,860
with any of the Pam products that are

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,030
out there and they can automatically

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,340
connect as long as they have

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,630
connectivity to that device if its local

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,700
that's where again you have to get

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,140
creative and like one of the things that

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,290
I encourage is if they're deploying

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,400
servers say for example from a template

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,750
obviously it has the same admin account

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,280
every time you deploy that template the

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,910
first thing in your operational manual

00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,520
should be all right I updated this local

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,980
admin password to you know this 64

00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,840
character password and you can make it

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,309
that long because if you go to the Pam

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,450
tool it's just going to copy and paste

00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,330
it and you don't have to worry about it

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,410
that way it's a lot stronger password

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,809
but that's one way that you could

00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,460
achieve that if connectivity isn't

00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,050
available if it is I would encourage you

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,480
know a vaulting solution in that

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,580
scenario and then one of the things that

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,440
can happen is even without that workers

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,179
knowledge that can change that password

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:20,090
periodically and the users none the

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:21,170
wiser that makes sense I think the other

00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,260
thing I wanted I'm sorry you had a

00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,260
question

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:49,320
absolutely and the other piece that most

00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,880
of the Pam tools out there will have as

00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,190
workflow surrounding that so especially

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,840
for more sensitive privileged to count

00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,210
you can put workflow behind it so if you

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,799
do want to reset that password even if

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,120
the notification because they're not

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,120
going to send the password to your email

00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,940
the good news in that scenario is it

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,830
would send you a link to go back to the

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,510
Pam tool and say like say for example I

00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,730
had to go to my boss to get approval to

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,919
reset the password on this server once

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,940
my boss approved it I would then click

00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,440
on the link that would take me into the

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,089
Pam tool I can now check out that

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,889
account again so what we're trying to

00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:24,960
get out of is the business of passwords

00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,440
really all together we know that's not

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,389
realistic so if we can control who knows

00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,609
what that password is at any given point

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:34,440
in time and you know going back through

00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:36,679
the use cases that's where the session

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,820
management is so valuable because

00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,800
they're initiating that session they

00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,899
have no awareness whatsoever of what

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,339
that password is now I'm going to put a

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,500
caveat on this because we are at a

00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,839
hackers conference there are ways to

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,879
figure out what that password is yeah

00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:52,980
because if you're in an rdp session

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,409
where the server is pasting it there's a

00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,730
good chance your client may see what's

00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,580
going on if you're paying attention to

00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,080
the traffic so that's why adding that

00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,330
additional password control especially

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,859
for highly sensitive accounts once the

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:08,400
admin session is done go ahead and

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,830
change the password you know that way

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,400
you know when you're auditing team comes

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:15,510
calling and they will you could say we

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,530
have this control and we have this

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:21,280
control and they're going to walk away

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:32,680
satisfied yes sir

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:35,890
I think its intrinsic to it especially

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,890
given the distributed nature of the

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,890
organization if you're you know

00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,570
outsourcing to you know a company in

00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,970
Ireland who's going to do a lot of your

00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,890
remote administration for you having

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,220
another factor to get into the Pam

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,290
system is extremely valuable and again

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,120
most of the tools out there will do that

00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,920
I wouldn't buy a tool that didn't

00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,990
support it and you can do that through a

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,580
number of functions you could use pki so

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,370
that only managed devices are coming

00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,140
across or you could use tokens things of

00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,130
that nature but I would recommend it

00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,230
especially for the more sensitive

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,230
accounts yes sir

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,700
absolutely I mean any fact I mean here's

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,530
the challenge you want to get into and

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,040
security is always about you know

00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,119
convenience versus security right it

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,190
depends on what you're doing and the

00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,350
data that you're protecting you know if

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,380
you talk to DoD their use of smart cards

00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:35,210
it's been extremely successful for them

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,440
if you talk to a small 50-person company

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,520
whether they want to do biometrics

00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,740
they're probably going to say yeah we're

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,050
not there yet but they might you know

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,320
maybe invest in some RSA tokens you know

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:47,090
something along those lines you know I

00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,920
think it particularly depends on who

00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:52,340
you're collaborating with but you know

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,869
to me if passwords are the only way that

00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,000
you're getting access to a system in

00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:57,440
most use cases you need to look at

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,720
another factor of authentication and go

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,330
with it it's just you can avoid so many

00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:06,110
headaches it's not foolproof I have no

00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:08,470
delusions in that sense but it improves

00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:14,080
your chances of surviving a breach

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:14,080
exponentially yes sir

00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:22,429
well I'm going to briefly do a plug for

00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:26,719
my friend in the back of the room from

00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:27,769
wicked systems they they certainly can

00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:29,059
help you out in that regard there's a

00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:30,619
there's a lot of vendors in that space

00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,390
they have a pretty novel approach to it

00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,369
that I particularly appreciate

00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:38,390
unfortunately my company didn't get

00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:39,709
there fast enough but but you know there

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,929
was a lot of good players out there and

00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:44,419
great opportunity to plug one of our key

00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:47,150
sponsors of b-sides so I didn't want to

00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:52,189
miss that chance and nickel pay you ten

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:58,400
dollars later haha yeah you get a free

00:37:52,189 --> 00:38:00,499
token anybody else I think the one last

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,239
comment i want to make was specific to

00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:03,499
the gds presentation you know they were

00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,549
talking about when you know when they're

00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:09,199
doing pen tests and they're looking at

00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:14,329
servers that have jboss instances or you

00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:16,640
find him a wordpress admin module on one

00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:19,309
of your servers which I wish I didn't

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,719
believe that but I've been in this

00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:25,429
business too long that's the critical

00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,989
piece you know there's one piece that

00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:28,419
has to be remediation and obviously

00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:32,209
their job is to find the vulnerabilities

00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:33,589
but that gets back to you know the ATM

00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:37,519
vendor who's still using the default

00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:39,650
password from 25 years ago that's where

00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,890
that piece and I talked about that

00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,329
collaborative aspect of it if you're in

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,579
a large enough company that uses a

00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:49,519
methodology for systems deployment

00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:52,909
whether it's sdlc ITIL DevOps whatever

00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,949
it is get that aspect into their

00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:58,309
operational profiles so that they're not

00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:59,809
only managing it and enrolling it within

00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:01,609
the system but it's starting at the very

00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:03,289
beginning of that system development

00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,599
life cycle because the more that you can

00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:08,059
achieve at the front end of that and get

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,380
into the beginning of the project it's

00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,880
going to make their lives so much easier

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,919
down the road so some of that

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,569
operational overhead that you get by

00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:17,209
remediating with privileged access

00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:18,439
management actually diminishes over time

00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:21,949
because it's already built into the

00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:24,519
process for deploying that system any

00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:24,519
other questions

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,140
well thank you guys very much for your

00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,140
