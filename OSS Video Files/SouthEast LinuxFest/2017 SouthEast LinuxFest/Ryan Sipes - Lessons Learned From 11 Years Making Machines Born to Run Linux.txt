the following presentation was recorded

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,980
at the southeast linux fest in charlotte

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,220
would like to thank the following

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,480
diamond sponsors for helping make these

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:31,080
videos possible we just created last

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,809
year the idea is that we actually do

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,160
quite a bit open-source development and

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,440
we work with now you know no boon to all

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,660
these upstream projects but usually

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,360
people really don't know that and like

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,370
they just think that we get a machine

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,379
slap our logo on and send it out the

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,000
door and that's pretty erroneous because

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,190
it takes quite a bit of work to make

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,579
sure that everything just works you

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,989
start at the machine but another thing

00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,730
that most people don't know is that

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,590
we've been doing this for 11 years yes I

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,270
realized that said lessons from 10 years

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,799
making machine corner on Linux it's

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,070
because whenever I was originally made

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,260
this slide deck that's how long it was

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,990
and then I was lazy enough to not just

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,549
change the 10 to at 11 so instead I just

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,950
added you know a little bit of

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:22,080
information under that I'll just get

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,840
right into it I'm going to talk briefly

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,189
about well not briefly most of the time

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,360
about system 76 is passed and

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,280
interspersed in there are little lessons

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,290
you can apply to your own projects and

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:41,130
then with about 20 minutes left you can

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,630
ask me any question you want if it

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,820
doesn't have anything to do with system

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,200
76 Linux or open-source I probably want

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,700
to answer it but you can try but getting

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,939
into it this is a picture of our

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:59,390
fearless leader Karl approximately nine

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:01,680
years ago this was system 76 back then

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,219
it was in his basement

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,539
not his garage you know like the typical

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:13,800
founder and my favorite he was actually

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:17,090
working on sound on that lap up there

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,090
trying to make it work properly

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:25,050
drivers were much more of a problem than

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:30,360
than they are now and so originally what

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:33,240
Karl did was he system76 old any heart

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,140
piece of hardware that we could make

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,150
sure worked with Linux and that included

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,740
printers that we'll get to it here in a

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,020
second but he put it all sorts of stuff

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:48,900
there thank God we don't do now but uh

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:56,390
that was employee number two down there

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:59,250
in his lap it's dead now but the I

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,810
remember him telling me a story about

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,850
how you know he's working out his

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,700
basement and he would ship things with

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,350
DHL I think and the DHL guy was really

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,050
impressed because every time he had just

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,050
more and more stuff to send with him

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:22,470
EHR guys dead Knapton when we started uh

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,700
most of you who have heard of us

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,670
probably know we should be boon to run

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,670
our machines that almost didn't happen

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,900
we almost shipped a distribution a

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,900
well-known distribution called yogurt

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,330
there's a screenshot over on the right

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:48,870
it was really hard to find the opers

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:52,080
logo and then it looks terrible because

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,870
that's my work they're you know

00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:02,310
trying to get it I'm a transparent

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:04,530
background so don't judge and this was

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,170
something that if you're working on

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,209
hardware this is that little start of

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,370
the nuggets of wisdom if you're working

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,580
on hardware try to pick a platform that

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,359
you think has legs you doing interesting

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,160
things I don't know what they were but

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,350
at the end of the day you know going to

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
had a company behind it it looked like

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,660
it was going to get ongoing spork for

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
the foreseeable future ultimately

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:36,960
I think we made the right decision and

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:41,300
going with a good Jew over yogurt this

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:48,120
is our website back in the day it looks

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:54,390
really awesome I love there's so much

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:58,080
here and and I love how this part in

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:01,050
particular is really entertaining if you

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,140
just sit here and read it because it

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,670
says freedom now available and I asked

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:13,400
him why he used this statue with a cone

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,400
on its head and he said it look cool

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,200
computers to change your world in

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,720
business education and life and then an

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,930
ellipses and an asterisk and if you look

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,930
down the asterisks says Linux rules

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,820
fortunately we had free shipping on any

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,380
order over 800 and I don't really have

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:41,000
anything to say about this beyond that I

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:46,170
just find it really interesting alright

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,870
so the second bit of nugget you're

00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,540
working on making laptops born to run

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:57,270
Linux you have to engage with this thing

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,920
called the community which is picking me

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,770
rough because it's about 30% full of

00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,760
 and then like the rest of 70%

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:08,160
of really good people but back when we

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,110
started we were part of this thing

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,670
called loco you know like there were

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:17,490
lots of locos and those were essentially

00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,350
good blue to user groups and as you can

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,930
see here we started getting involved

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,810
with you know the local Linux user

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:30,060
groups and setting up events and helping

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:31,620
to spread the information now we're not

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,130
as active in like the day-to-day

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,890
planning of like the X user groups in

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,830
town but we have we try to hold big

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,220
events to bring all the Linux and open

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,120
source

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,350
together also just right before coming

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,950
here we held a mixer for the coreboot

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,610
team and so they're in Denver for a

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:58,200
conference that they organized and

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,660
that's really really important if you're

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:06,510
you're going to be working on hardware

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:08,400
the Linux or is aimed at you know open

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,250
source enthusiasts it's important to

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,360
actually be a part of the community and

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:20,850
I have to say that the Corbin guys are

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:27,060
really really really smart and I say

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:29,750
that not to like put me myself down or

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:37,200
to raise them up but they're just

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:40,100
freakin smart dudes and I have been

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,050
dating this girl and she wanted to know

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,720
what I did and so I was like well I

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:52,080
organized this mixer why don't you come

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:55,400
and hang out and and like ten minutes in

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,280
like listening to all of us talk about

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,710
coreboot and about you know porting

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,770
existing hardware over to using coreboot

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:11,750
I just saw her like eyes glaze over and

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:16,490
it took copious amounts of wine or for

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:20,580
everything to match up in the room but

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:24,140
all around it was a success so being

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,140
involved with the community is important

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:33,419
when I a Dell or an HP or you know some

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:38,219
giant enterprise lot lots people trying

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:41,960
to compete with them which we do a

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:45,420
decent job of you have to wear many hats

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,860
and so this is an early picture and all

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,470
the pictures are really more for my

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,510
enjoyment than yours because these

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,970
people are totally different now but I

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,200
love seeing them with like long hair you

00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:02,010
know

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:06,630
forty pounds ago whatever it is so if

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:09,600
you ever talk to us now we're nearing we

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,269
have about 20 people now but if you talk

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,250
to us and you get me you know you might

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:16,440
get me on the phone and then I'm like

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,449
hey this is Ryan and then you're like I

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,870
want to talk to you know they can be

00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:26,329
manager and I'll be like okay one moment

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,329
I was like hey this is can you manager

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,800
we proposed to wear many hats but that's

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:33,510
not really all that different than a lot

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,970
of folks you'll talk to here you know

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,350
working on new projects or or even

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,899
existing projects that have been around

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,269
for a while sometimes it shocks me to

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,800
talk to somebody who is part of a

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,410
project I think is a really large

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,570
project and then they're kind of like

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,089
it's kind of like oh yeah this is really

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,060
cool and you you like you know the main

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:56,459
developer okay it and it's like okay

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,889
yeah we should like come up with some

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:01,170
event you know and like work to get more

00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,720
people involved and it's like who should

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,399
I talk to you for that it's like homie

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,600
it's like okay awesome

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:18,930
that's a he do all that our big breakout

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:20,550
was in a really simple move we were well

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,149
I don't know this for certain but I

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,600
think it's true and therefore it is true

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:30,690
the we were the one of the first

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,910
companies to sell a lot of time not

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,519
running Windows and to change out he to

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,620
reflect the operating system that was

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,339
actually running on the machine because

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,560
there's nothing that is more like I'm

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,899
not disgusting than hitting a Windows

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,440
key when you're using Linux on your

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,990
machine

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,959
I don't know that always made me feel

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,370
dirty that's a good shower and then

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,139
whatever I was working on would have to

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,519
wait and then now it hit the key again

00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:04,350
it's just a it's just a bad deal and so

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:06,600
so when we change that key out because

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,399
it began to reflect the identity of the

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,139
people who are buying our products who

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,069
sold

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:15,529
products which seems kind of crazy I say

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:17,689
this often but that key doesn't actually

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:21,829
do anything different you know than it

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:26,629
did with the windows logo but what we

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:29,689
were tapping into was this idea that I

00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:32,480
sure everyone here understands that when

00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:36,199
your end open-sourcing into Linux it's a

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,089
part of your identity and when your

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:43,299
computer did more than just your tool

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:45,859
and so when walks by you know and they

00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:47,839
that you want them to know that there's

00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:48,350
something different going on here or at

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,069
least I do

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,540
in fact people coffee shops have been

00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:56,899
really unfortunate to like ask me a

00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:01,970
question because you know I'll be

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:06,049
sitting there and I'll be like you have

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:08,089
a seat oh yeah oh yeah you can do this

00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:10,850
down here you can do that here it of

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:14,779
Linux we're going to be here well two

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:20,139
more copies and so yeah and that's all

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,139
part of this marketing open source which

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:32,239
is not as bad as we like to think of it

00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:35,809
sometimes I listen to the integers be

00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:38,809
relatable like apologetic about like you

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:40,309
know like oh yeah well this is different

00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:43,369
you can't really do that and you can't

00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:46,100
really do this and I think that's a

00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:48,709
that's from a perspective of privilege

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,470
because we've had the privilege to use

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,480
Windows for a long time and so you're

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,089
apologizing for things that I think that

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,809
most users don't even care about or

00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:04,610
notice like I sit down in front of a

00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:09,470
Windows machine because friend was like

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,709
hey I updated now won't boot and I was

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,709
like okay you realize like I don't like

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,360
touching windows so yeah here's a less

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:21,230
tech-savvy friend I have and so I'm

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,280
ranking alright and so I found the

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,130
problem

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,960
I don't really know I didn't into it too

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,140
much but I just read you know like a

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,220
this update screws up machines you

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:37,800
should roll back and then wait and xp

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,310
for whatever and so I was like no

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,670
problem this is this will be simple you

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,570
know

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,980
Windows is a is a is the most what the

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,360
most popular desktop

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,870
you know operating system on the planet

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,890
like surely they thought through rolling

00:13:51,870 --> 00:14:01,470
back updates and that's be simple so I

00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:03,140
booted into safe mode and I and they

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,630
were like okay now type this command

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:11,010
into the command prompt and it's the the

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,180
first part that didn't make any sense

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,620
but that's okay

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,100
I think the first part of command was

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,080
you know like identifying the update to

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,180
rollback so it's like I don't know it's

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,990
like NTSB something something something

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,360
- something you matter because like I

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,790
only have to think that's nothing that's

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:35,270
not that bad but then the update

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:39,420
identifier was like 255 characters of

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:43,380
nothing that meant anything and it was

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,660
like it was like caps lower case numbers

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,120
you know letters and I'm sitting there

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,160
like very carefully typing it because

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,490
I'm in safe mode and I can't like copy

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,140
and paste it from the browser and I was

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,760
like if I screw this up I'm only going

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,620
to do this once and if I screw this up

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:04,560
I'm just done like and fortunately I

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,570
didn't screw it up but I say all of that

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,210
to bring us back to marketing

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,900
open-source isn't actually that hard we

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:16,560
have in the same day we typically have a

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:19,620
phone call you know an engineer hat it's

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,750
like you know some Silicon Valley

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,060
company like Google or Amazon or Tesla

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,780
that uses our machine asking a question

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,870
and then we have you know some 75 year

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,030
old guy who you know either found us you

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,540
know what I consider to be erroneously

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,139
but then bought a machine or the which

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,949
is

00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:44,699
fine idea the one of them that I got to

00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:46,709
listen to was he was 77 and he was

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,699
saying that this computer is fantastic

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,529
it's great okay

00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:52,529
you know I've had it for four years and

00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:54,419
hasn't slowed death at all and you know

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:56,100
I'm hoping that I can just continue to

00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:01,199
use this since I died which was rather

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:04,049
morbid thought but but I'm glad that was

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,929
his sentiment I it was like I kind of

00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:09,029
like man like you know just to have some

00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,449
more hope that you're gonna make it

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,389
longer

00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:13,559
I mean Dick Van Dyke is 90 and he

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:19,730
doesn't look like he's gonna die any

00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:24,299
time and so anyway so as a result we've

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:26,759
we really tried to embrace you know the

00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:28,919
open source code tried to convey that in

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,839
all of our conversations with our

00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:37,609
customers it is a little unfortunate

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:37,609
that our community has a really bad

00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:45,660
distrust of any organization that makes

00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:47,639
money with open source which is which is

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,009
really unfortunate only because like we

00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,360
sit there at work all day and most of

00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,189
the conversations we have are the

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,429
conversations type of conversations that

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:58,619
happen here and like nobody's like yeah

00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:01,619
we're gonna make money off these suckers

00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:03,959
you know most of us are like like you

00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:07,350
know like I can't believe they did this

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:10,350
in Whalen you know or like what the heck

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:16,260
is now I'm doing with this hot corner

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:18,449
and things like that and and so we try

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,319
to convey that in everything that we do

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:27,319
like who we are and that were a part of

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,319
the community and it's been working for

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:35,309
we have unique culture at system76

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,110
that guy who's had we printed multiple

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:40,710
times and put on sticks for everyone

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:45,379
his our is our operating operations

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:48,629
manager and he just he's he's from

00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:51,030
Scandinavia and he's just kind of a

00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:53,730
gruff guy and so

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:56,870
he gives us that look a lot so we wanted

00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:01,590
to be able to get him that look and

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:04,980
that's really that's really it and then

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,020
yeah another piece of insight into our

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,430
culture if you're not having fun at what

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,840
you're doing then you're not doing it

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,260
right or you're not doing the right

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,870
thing for those of you can't read it

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,650
April says hey hey hey guys

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:22,020
Cass says hey hi April said if you hear

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,780
about the space bar and Cass says hey

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,840
and then April so the drinks are great

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,270
and in Cass's oh no terrible joke

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,390
incoming and then April says but the

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,070
atmosphere is terrible and then then

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,690
China's then with I heard they're out of

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:42,750
this world and then April leaves the

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:45,150
chat which happens pretty often actually

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,370
like not just April in each other people

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,280
being like okay well I don't need to be

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:55,230
advantage her for a while here's some

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:58,830
more engaging the community for as long

00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:03,530
as system76 has been around we've tried

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:08,490
to reach out to tech press journalists

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:11,600
open-source influencers who are interest

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,430
would be interested in what we're doing

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:20,370
you know like I said we've been around

00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:21,870
for 11 years and and it seems like every

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,330
time I come to one of these events now

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,510
you know Dell has been scaling up

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:33,450
putting more time and effort into

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:35,220
engaging the community and and people

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,810
don't like when I bash them down a

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,400
little bit but kind of I gana welcome to

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,860
the welcome to the club

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,060
you got a long way to go sit your seep

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:52,530
in like we have here forever really Ken

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:54,120
will show you around and even on reddit

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,260
you need to engage the community when

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,000
you're working on any open source

00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:02,580
project or anything touching open-source

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,770
unfortunately or fortunately you deal

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,900
with really smart people all the time

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:10,230
you have to be willing to engage them

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,170
and talk to them about technical merit

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,820
or talk to them about you know in the

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,820
world you're doing in detail

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,060
fortunately the perk of that is if you

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:30,660
are willing to engage with them on a

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:34,710
human level and talk like technical

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,290
merits and usually our community comes

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,530
around really well it's a good solid

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:44,550
arguments it could be worse

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:51,300
you know could be nevermind that's

00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:53,610
probably pensive yeah so and then we

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,250
also bring people in we have a superfan

00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:03,300
event which I believe one of the

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:04,620
superfans is Aaron were you super fan no

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,620
you're just awesome

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:10,560
I get that confused sometimes so this is

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,340
our super fan event the last time we

00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:17,940
invited there's George Castro Michael

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,330
Dominick murdered on the street

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:28,140
whoa I don't I don't know his last name

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:31,220
I guess I never asked and he know he I

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,720
know he wrote one of the Ubuntu books

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,520
and we just asked people who are doing

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,900
really cool stuff to come and hang out

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,930
with us in our office and we made them

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,300
dress up and you know DNG type clothing

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:46,790
and had a headache

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,020
LARPing session and has a lot of fun

00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:57,360
mostly baking allegations and making

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:59,310
them dress up but we keep growing you

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,980
know more people raise their hands every

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:08,370
time W Laporte using Bjork's Pro that

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,110
was really interesting because the

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,830
community can also be a set of bastards

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,900
the because like he gets his machine and

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,970
he's in the chat with like his viewers

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,720
and he's like okay I just started my

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,419
booty machine

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,600
like looking good what should I do and

00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:27,780
they're like reinstall starch on it

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,780
install you know like like you got a

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,289
change like the desktop environment how

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,419
do I do that

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:37,380
handy giving him commands through the

00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:40,590
commit like to the chat and like someone

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,559
pinged us and was like there they're

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:48,780
trying to get vo to install arch and we

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:50,250
were like whoa like and so we popped in

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,620
the chat and we were trying to who

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,659
trying to help him do what he wanted to

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,720
do and try out this different stuff but

00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:01,140
like like also not like more cos machine

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,230
like 20 minutes into opening it you know

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,620
especially like hey like for for us in

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,940
this room but like he was new I mean we

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,210
were making him like the sacrificial

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,710
lamb you know and the worst thing is we

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,020
were doing like the only reason I have a

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:21,090
problem is we were doing it live on like

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:24,690
you know his show so the but he's good

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:30,480
now he's good he's fine he gets it he's

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:32,130
down he's hit one thing that we've tried

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,679
to do lately is highlight when we

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,900
actually when when we're working up

00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,210
strain with the community that's really

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,789
important like I said tried to tie this

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:45,360
into nuggets of wisdom that you can take

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:47,340
if you're doing something but your users

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,230
or your you know people would be

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,780
interesting interested in your project

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,179
don't know then that's really

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,260
unfortunate because it's not going to

00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:01,710
drive you know contributions or more

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:05,010
users and so we've been really focused

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,169
on you know when we're doing something

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,960
interesting in the community and making

00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:12,750
sure that that everybody's aware we have

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,460
a telegram channel where we share this

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:20,789
information as it rolls out of your

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:23,150
telegram err your that telegram I keep

00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:24,490
forgetting to remove this slide

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,650
[Laughter]

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,650
[Applause]

00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,640
and I just I made a note of it the last

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:41,490
like two times fun no actually we can go

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,990
back we can go back so we're no longer

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:48,840
playing the long game with unity a we as

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,810
many of you might know we started

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,330
working on we started working out of

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,130
starting with gnome we've worked on our

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,440
own gnome theme that went planned on

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,450
shipping by default on our machines of

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,650
course you'll be able to be easily

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:07,470
change that to - what's the name of that

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:11,480
theme that comes by to fall not ambulant

00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:15,480
ed whadya yeah if you really love and

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:20,190
while you can you can use it I'll judge

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:24,300
you but it but it's fine and we've also

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:27,630
tried to look at some sane extensions to

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,390
include as well as we've been retaken

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,000
undertaken the interesting job of

00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:37,470
integrating the technology using KDE

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,030
connect into the shell so that it can

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,090
easily pair your phone to your computer

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,950
and share notifications and do other

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,340
things like if you sit down in front of

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:51,090
your machine have an auto unlock things

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,740
so where we decided once unity eight

00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,240
died that we weren't going to wait on

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,730
anybody to implement the features of

00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:03,960
anymore and so we've taken a lot of that

00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:06,240
in-house it will be a package and

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,730
probably an extension as well the

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,640
package to handle all of the really

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,370
complicated you know stuff and then the

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:20,910
extension to make it so that it it feels

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:23,250
native to the gnome experience there's a

00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:27,000
there's a KDE connect app I think what

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:29,210
we're going to do only because KDE has

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,140
different design language and different

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:36,300
now the front end of that will probably

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,440
be different

00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:43,920
put the put the back end stuff home

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,780
the same there are something to an

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,370
implement but where we're trying to make

00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,200
sure with all these projects you are

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,860
Christopher sending that all back

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,960
upstream so anything you do on the back

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,340
end that makes for a better experience

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,050
we're going to send that back up the

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:08,340
same that's the same with our theme our

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:11,240
theme is is a I'm blanking on the name

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,080
right now but we've been any

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,620
improvements we made we've been sending

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,770
them that back up stream as well and

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,770
then the thing we've been doing lately

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,110
which people seem to really like because

00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,380
we've begun building a manufacturing

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:33,420
facility in Denver and begun own

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:38,010
in-house designs boards and Chafee's for

00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:40,320
both laptops and desktops and so I think

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,230
next early next year is when we'll

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,680
release our first completely in-house

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:49,260
design and manufacture desktop and then

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,390
hopefully we'll follow along with

00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,670
another desktop and then I think a lot

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,230
of tops which would be really exciting

00:27:53,670 --> 00:28:00,660
because right now you know we work with

00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:03,020
partners in Taiwan and other places it's

00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,880
great but you have to make compromises

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:10,740
that sometimes we don't want to make and

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:14,390
so we decided that the only way to do

00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,820
this correctly is to bring in-house and

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:22,970
and I think that that will make us the

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:25,550
only computer manufacturer that

00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:30,270
manufacturing their computers in the US

00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:33,600
so that'll be really awesome fortunately

00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:37,080
all of our customers have been fantastic

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,770
and have grown to a place where we have

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,440
the resources to do so I'm really

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:46,400
excited about it and it opens up a lot

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:52,830
of it opens up a lot of doors around

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:54,240
rethinking things that that the computer

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,510
in front of

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:02,670
you know this guy is meant to appeal

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:07,110
broadly to everyone and maybe it's

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:10,230
conceded but we're not everyone we don't

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:13,280
have the same preferences as the general

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,870
public because we're because like I said

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:20,580
for most of us this is more than just a

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:23,130
tool it's a way of expressing yourself

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:28,980
it's a way of part of it becomes part of

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:31,740
your identity and and so I have had each

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:35,309
of these Linux conferences people sit me

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,970
down and tell me why the Lenovo I don't

00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:40,530
know I don't know the model names like X

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,740
225 keyboard was like the best thing

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:46,590
ever had seven rows instead of six and

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:50,000
you just like they you know they

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:52,650
obviously have like very specific

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,110
desires and needs around their computer

00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,429
and and they're still using the damn

00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:01,020
thing from like twelve years ago and so

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:03,030
by being able to completely design

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:06,710
manufacturing house that allows us to

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:10,710
address these things that are really

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:16,020
important and not being addressed by you

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:19,080
know someone like who's just trying to

00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,390
sell as many machines to as large an

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,950
audience as possible and hopefully the

00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:27,750
same model you know so we'll see where

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,520
it goes all this is open going to be

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,970
open sourced to all of our hardware

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,100
designs all of our boards so as we get

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,330
closer to releasing it we'll put that

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,370
out in the open and you'll be able to

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:41,340
provide feedback and also if you have

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:46,890
the resources to do so create the damn

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:52,559
thing yourself you know so then you guys

00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:53,850
can be a part of the profit so this

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,360
isn't even the end of my talk

00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:59,940
if you undertake any open-source project

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,140
or start a computer your company

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,900
whatever it is make sure that you're

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,920
following your passion because you're

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,600
doing with your lot

00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,040
what you love it'll never feel like work

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,160
you won't work a day in your life you've

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:18,000
heard this but that's how I feel every

00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:22,530
day that's me in the middle using my

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,790
magical powers to make Emma I don't

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:28,410
really know what's going on there

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:30,950
actually and and then on the right there

00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,360
because that's not me in the tux ooh but

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,120
this is my favorite story to tell

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,910
Jeremy is our new kernel engineer and

00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:44,390
he's not new anymore but he was then and

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:46,590
we had a party and he was like and he

00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,410
kind of pulled himself he is a really

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,090
really smart guy but I thought it was my

00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,010
job to take him down a peg or two

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:58,230
and so he came over and ionized drinking

00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,180
and he said oh yeah you're getting

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:03,540
started early and it was it was like 11

00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:05,670
o'clock in the morning and I was like I

00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,860
was like yeah you know like since

00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,540
there's people in the office all day and

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,910
we're having a party you know just take

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,900
me a job he's like how many beers here

00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,080
and I'm like um

00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,450
two beers in and then I saw an

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,590
opportunity and I was like I bet you

00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:24,090
can't keep up he's like he's like yeah I

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,480
can keep up and I was like all right

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,540
cool

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,970
I was like well here two beers and so he

00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:32,970
downs those two beers and then he would

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:37,310
leave and then when he came back I would

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:39,120
lie about how many more I'd had and so

00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,920
it was really simple

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,080
he didn't verify it in any way shape or

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,390
form like where the cans or whatever so

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,150
he would come back in he bi it would

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,520
only be like 20 minutes and four more in

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:56,100
man like here you go like keep up and

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,460
then like about three hours later I was

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,360
like you got to get in the tuck suit

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,250
he's like I don't want to go into

00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,090
texting I think everyone does it when

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:09,330
they start and I've never been in a tuck

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,400
suit and he was like really everyone

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,799
doesn't I'm like yeah everyone dude I

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:17,460
don't know why we're arguing about this

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,989
so got in the tech suit and kind of

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,480
stumbled his way around the office

00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:23,369
that's whenever I was like dude I'm

00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,139
three years and so he had to reach in

00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:29,759
and try to figure that out

00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:33,239
needless to say he hasn't drank with me

00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:38,309
since because the next day he's like

00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:39,629
he's like it's like wow how are you

00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:46,619
doing so well I was like you know I only

00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:49,259
had like three beers yesterday and have

00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:51,779
fun I I wish I need to put the original

00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,789
version of this picture Cass was walking

00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,169
away from a carousel but he just had his

00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:59,399
phone and like the perfect position

00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:04,980
everything so I went back and spruced it

00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:07,590
up a little bit all right cool this is

00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,190
my favorite part questions ask me

00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:13,409
anything oh my goodness all right

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:26,879
well we'll start here and then working

00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:30,210
our way back yeah we we have a stated

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,879
goal of having an eye fixes score of 11

00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,649
out of 10 and so we've been working

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,589
really hard to make everything not only

00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,299
modular but easily accessible the laptop

00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,909
or the desktop that we're working on

00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:44,099
which some people online because we

00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:49,980
showed people at our super fan event the

00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:52,109
designs is is really really really easy

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,490
to take apart and get to all the parties

00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:56,220
like super easily

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:59,099
it's about the same size as my machine

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:03,119
which I have a mini ITX board in but

00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:07,740
it's so much easier to it's a full-size

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:11,040
board and it's so much easier to to work

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:14,010
on okay it's night day mine when I get

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,990
in there I lift the top off and there's

00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,690
like no room to do anything because

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:23,069
they're just cables and like running

00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:25,260
every which direction and so I really

00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:27,780
hope we'll be able to get some of the

00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,720
designs up online here soon in a

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,660
like github repo or something so that

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:39,780
folks can see what I'm talking about but

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:41,610
yeah the idea is to go think about

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,710
always if you want to know what

00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,840
direction we're going think about Apple

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:50,400
and then generally go the opposite way

00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,630
the only tip the only thing that we

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,160
share is that we're both where we've

00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:02,010
been putting more and more and more time

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:04,260
into design and so I guess I'm trying to

00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:09,980
say is our machines are still sexy you

00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,980
can also just replace parts them and so

00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,920
yeah okay

00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,560
beyond the website not a

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,780
brick-and-mortar retail presence we do

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,850
have deals with more and more companies

00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,360
around reseller programs and things like

00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:39,390
that but no we're not in any stores

00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,940
that's partially because part of our

00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:47,160
claim to fame is customizing every

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:50,690
single component the machine and and

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,950
we've been asked to be like prize and a

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,190
micro Center but the problem would be

00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:59,190
that you wouldn't have the ability to

00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,570
say we have to stock like just these

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,120
different builds or you wouldn't have

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:16,910
the ability to say you know what exactly

00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:16,910
goes yeah

00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:48,270
yeah yeah yeah the the one example of

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,820
that which is just because it's easy is

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:53,430
we invite everyone we're right off of

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,960
16th Street Denver you know so we invite

00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,090
anyone who wants to to come up and just

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:03,840
play with the machines we have a lab set

00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:05,910
up and everything yeah yeah I think we'd

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,800
love to do that it's going to be a

00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:12,390
matter of I guess scale and you know how

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,770
many people would make their way in

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,100
there I could see that definitely

00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:19,820
happening in in San Francisco just

00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:24,870
because we have a lot of customers there

00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:29,510
it'd be yeah it would be as possible I

00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:32,670
think that's probably in maybe like a

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:37,830
two to three year like time scale

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:40,550
I would guess yeah mostly because we

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:45,240
grow about 150 percent year over year

00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:48,390
but but I don't know that there's quite

00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:52,260
the amount of interest there that I'd

00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:56,540
like you know and just random people

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,540
coming in and playing with this stuff

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:04,200
yeah we'll see we'll do what we can you

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:12,990
can do I'll take it back to the head

00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:17,660
keys what's that yeah there you go

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:24,510
that would be good that's good yeah yeah

00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:27,660
me we'll send Jeremy out there yeah okay

00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:29,700
well I'll bear in mind maybe that's a

00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,220
very see if you can't get the gala going

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,710
this in brick-and-mortar place

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:38,340
the Galgo is kind of a kind of a

00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:42,210
breakaway product because just in light

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,910
its powerful and so we've debated doing

00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:47,280
special things for it but it might end

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:51,750
up being one of the one of the next-gen

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:55,220
ones where everything is you know as

00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,220
close to perfect as possible

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:26,830
I think it's an open question I think

00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:31,470
it's a good question we we as demand

00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:34,750
gets higher we continue to scale up and

00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:38,380
so far we haven't met the upper limit of

00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:41,070
that but you know I guess I guess the

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,990
truthful answers who knows you know the

00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:46,750
hopefully as we're getting more money in

00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:49,480
from projects force us to scale up we

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:56,220
get to pour that back into scaling up

00:40:49,480 --> 00:41:00,340
right now we do support you know some

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,660
some big names that more and more of

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,960
their departments are buying our

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,590
machines and that is interesting and fun

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,530
and that we get to you know triangle

00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:15,820
that demand and doing the most efficient

00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:17,890
way possible would you share with the

00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:25,500
class here who you're with

00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:25,500
oh yeah yeah of course yeah

00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,100
yeah

00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:17,400
yeah yeah the thing I'd say is that the

00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,900
is that when it comes to like support

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,030
you know I don't really I don't really

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:26,890
think that's a problem partially because

00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:31,859
like what what kind of support can you

00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,859
feasibly expect from like a lenovo yeah

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:57,880
yeah I I think in I think and I'm

00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:02,050
speaking off-the-cuff here I think when

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,500
it comes to hundreds of machines that's

00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,710
easy

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,010
thousands of machines that's less

00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:13,150
usually but so feasible the other thing

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:15,430
that we do is we don't reel when the Sun

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:21,580
yeah something that Dell Lenovo do that

00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:24,310
we don't is when a new Intel processor

00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:27,790
drops we don't we don't stock the last

00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:29,500
gen we just don't do that you know it's

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:36,490
it's a personal decision that we've made

00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:39,190
you know it sounded weird but uh but I

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:41,200
mean we might have some leftover ones so

00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,970
that could be a problem with scaling you

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,820
know because we we try to encourage our

00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:50,350
customers like just let's just move to

00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:54,450
the most current generation however I

00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:58,060
know from my talks with Red Hat that

00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:01,110
that right now you guys are have a have

00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:04,630
our machines and are assessing them and

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:07,690
and we've talked about how to get around

00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:09,430
you know problems but if you have to

00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:11,680
replace someone's live top how do you do

00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:14,080
that how many do we need to keep that in

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,730
order to make sure that's good so I

00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:24,900
don't know if you have talked to that

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:24,900
team at all or anything but yeah

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,950
well you did a good job because they one

00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,010
of your guys reached out to me and said

00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:39,180
that demands pretty high and so we need

00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:50,670
to figure something out

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:52,170
so yeah yeah yeah we're not gonna send

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,710
you a little bunch of machines with like

00:44:52,170 --> 00:45:02,400
a shitty Wi-Fi chip set that doesn't

00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:07,460
work properly yeah we for our sound card

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,900
on the aurochs we were testing it and

00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,310
you talked to real tech and you're like

00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:16,470
hey you driver sucks and they're like

00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,510
you want to fix it and it's like not

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:24,600
really they were like well here's the

00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:27,060
code and it's like great and then then

00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,600
we fix it we send it back they're like

00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:38,610
here's our new Linux driver it's like

00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:40,290
yeah you're welcome yeah so yeah but you

00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,810
know our big thing is that we're dog

00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,970
putting it with you know - and I know

00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:49,260
that somebody in the office uses fedora

00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:51,540
so our machines generally like some

00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,190
people are like well how can you

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,850
guarantee good Linux support in a

00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:00,090
cyclone we all did sell Linux and if it

00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:02,550
wasn't good we wouldn't make any money

00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:06,240
and then our company was shut down and

00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:09,690
then I would have to like move back in

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:13,260
with my parents and my dog would go

00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:15,780
hungry and so the it's a totally

00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:24,500
different story and you know like with

00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:24,500
us persons like these other guys yep

00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:43,890
yeah the so what we've done is we have

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:48,150
right now it depends on which product

00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:54,120
we're talking about the the desktop has

00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:57,780
a I don't remember which motherboard

00:46:54,120 --> 00:47:01,560
we've been testing it but the answer is

00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,300
complicated we have a we haven't put a

00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,550
laptop we have a board that handles all

00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,950
the connections so we have like this

00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,330
this main motherboard and then we have

00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,210
another board that handles all the

00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:15,120
connections to everything that attaches

00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:17,190
to the laptop all the firmware on that

00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,290
board is completely open-source but of

00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,630
course when you're dealing with Intel

00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,160
and some of these other and some of

00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:27,530
these standards they're not they're not

00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:30,360
open standards which really sucks and so

00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:32,370
the answer is it's a mixed bag that's

00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:36,180
why we invite folks like the Corbett

00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:38,250
people over to take their brain and we

00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,920
want to move as close to that as

00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:45,050
possible we even talked about other

00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:48,690
architectures our things like that I

00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:51,690
think we live in a we live in an

00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:53,880
interesting time in that you know there

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,520
are lots and lots of initiatives open up

00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,320
as much of this as possible but then

00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:04,050
again every time you anytime you port

00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,630
the stuff or you hack it in order to

00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:11,910
make it open you you make a trade of

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:14,640
something and the answer is we're we're

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:18,780
trying really really hard to open to

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,130
liberate as much of the hardware and the

00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,940
firmware that runs on that hardware as

00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:27,510
possible but we're also being really

00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:31,220
realistic about how much we can get open

00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:33,990
and how much we can peaceably do and

00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:37,380
understand that better you have to sit

00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:39,340
down and in Carl's mind he's been doing

00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,860
this for 11 years and trying to move

00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,020
and now closer and closer to ultimate

00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:48,850
vision of you know a completely open

00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,960
piece of hardware and heat but yes for

00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,560
me that's really hard because I'm

00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:57,520
impatient move around a lot privy and so

00:48:53,560 --> 00:49:00,700
the and he has this long you know

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,040
outlook on this is where we're going and

00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,240
we're going to do this you know focus on

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,840
one piece at a time

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,960
and so I think the laptop will move this

00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,420
way closer just because the work is much

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,320
more focused on that the desktop is more

00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:20,290
of a proof of concept can we and we then

00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:25,390
to make the chassis you know can we do

00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:27,400
all of the physical stuff so the answer

00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:29,520
is it's definitely at the forefront of

00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,290
our conversations at least once a week

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:36,850
but the but I don't know what the

00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:38,440
timeline on it looks like as far as for

00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,500
instance in talking to core group guys

00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,070
if you turn off certain parts of the

00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:49,390
Intel firmware I forced forcibly turn it

00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:52,090
off the computer will will shut down

00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:56,680
after 30 minutes or message like turn

00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:59,100
that crap back on and so that's the type

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,650
of thing that makes it difficult to

00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:05,860
liberate all that hard work but we're

00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:07,950
always open to ideas and you know we we

00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:13,150
have a reddit thread or we have a reddit

00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:15,400
subreddit reddit.com slash are 76 and

00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,470
that's probably the best place to if you

00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,960
have personal experience like working on

00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:22,660
a specific piece of hardware or you know

00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,700
opening or working on opening up the

00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,840
firmware for something to just post your

00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:31,050
ideas we're very very open to what

00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:35,500
people are doing we got to talk to you

00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:38,890
the guy who worked over at purism air

00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:42,910
coreboot project and and we talked to

00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:47,260
him at length and that seemed like a

00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:49,180
really hard job to undertake but he

00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,250
learns a lot of lessons from it we got

00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,059
the piggyback on those lessons that's

00:50:51,250 --> 00:51:10,069
what happens when you buy someone cook

00:50:53,059 --> 00:51:16,130
dear so good yeah

00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:18,259
we talked we talked at length about open

00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:21,619
up burning anybody else's time we talk

00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:25,789
it linked about a this this idea that

00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:27,619
we've had of a black laptop and I don't

00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:30,979
mean that in color I mean you know

00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:33,919
secure you eyes we have a lot of folks

00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:35,630
who buy our machines who are doing you

00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:42,109
know penetration testing and all this

00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:46,939
other security the white hat type stuff

00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:49,959
and as a result we think about that a

00:51:46,939 --> 00:51:51,529
lot we also talked to a lot of I

00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:53,929
personally talked to a lot of

00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:56,719
journalists a guy over at the intercept

00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:57,859
and a few other places about what

00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,519
they're concerned about

00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:03,559
when working abroad and what what tools

00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:08,299
you could arm them with out of the box

00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:10,630
in order to make their jobs easier the

00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:12,409
answer is all of this stuff plays into

00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,749
what we're talking about

00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:16,969
hopefully with the firmware that we're

00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:19,390
shipping you know with our with our

00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:21,650
board and everything on a future laptop

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:22,789
it'll make it it'll move us that much

00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,259
closer because you'll be able to audit

00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:29,449
that stuff and make sure there aren't

00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:30,769
any nasty backdoors like I said we we've

00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:33,109
been having a lot of conversations about

00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:35,919
with with some of the core boot guys

00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:38,900
about what we can do there

00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:41,509
honestly we probably need the formula

00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:44,089
you like draw the different layers and

00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:46,999
put that somewhere online and just with

00:52:44,089 --> 00:52:49,069
an open question of you know what what's

00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:52,640
the community out there working on how

00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:56,779
do we go from you know all these layers

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,059
being kind of dark black boxes to us to

00:52:56,779 --> 00:53:05,739
know long that no longer being the case

00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:05,739
but it is it is a top priority for us

00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,930
yeah I think the biggest my my biggest

00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:20,170
concern is that is that when we work

00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:22,150
with anybody is the AMD or Intel you

00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,069
know there's a there's still quite a bit

00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:29,349
of blobs in there that we don't really

00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:31,510
we can't really audit and be beat there

00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:34,089
was an Intel guy at the Corps boot mixer

00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:38,020
which became increasingly difficult for

00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:42,099
him I think as I got more drunk and and

00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:43,329
was like and by one of the guts would

00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:44,910
say something that they were doing wrong

00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:48,430
and I was like what do you think of that

00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:51,700
and he's like well I'm not really in

00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:58,799
charge of that and I was like well tell

00:53:51,700 --> 00:54:01,869
the guy who is Ryan's coming for it so I

00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:03,819
I think but generally like when I do

00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:05,829
talk to these guys who work at the

00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:09,069
hardware companies they are really open

00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:11,589
to you you have to make the argument in

00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:14,640
the right way but they're open to okay

00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:19,390
well you you have customers and wants

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,940
you know yes well okay well how many

00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:24,010
customers do you think that is you know

00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,540
it's like well here's how much we have

00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,849
right now you know but this will allow

00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:31,990
us to capture more in this sector or

00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:33,670
that sector and so frankly that's how

00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:36,220
you have to start to make the argument

00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:40,690
but if there's some way we can begin to

00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:42,670
judge demand around that stuff maybe

00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,220
like I said maybe it's through some kind

00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:47,470
of community portal where people can go

00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:49,410
and talk about this stuff then we can go

00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:54,579
back and say you know hey there's

00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:59,430
seemingly this much interest in in this

00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:59,430
being open how can we move towards that

00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:07,950
and who knows if if we can pay one day

00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:12,430
more than the NSA and contracts then

00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:13,230
maybe they'll change it any other

00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:16,900
questions

00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:19,589
like I said I'll be here I'll be here

00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:22,949
all weekend catch me at the

00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:26,169
that's pretty much it

00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:28,929
my informations down here feel pretty

00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:31,299
email me that's my twitter handle and

00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:33,939
then if you're on telegram which is the

00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:36,729
best way to get me my handle is the same

00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:38,769
across every single service and that's

00:55:36,729 --> 00:55:41,049
that Twitter handle right there rhyme

00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:44,979
neat' side so if you ping me on telegram

00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:49,299
and say where you at I will meet up with

00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:51,640
you and have conversations and if you

00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:55,689
buy me a beer then you've got me for

00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:56,380
life so alright guys thanks for coming

00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,119
to the talk

00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:06,789
take it easy enjoy the rest of the event

00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:09,959
oh hey one more thing got shirts that I

00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:09,959
