00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,319
very busy and active they don't really

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,759
govern us and control us they kind of

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,440

that money goes towards moving

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
drupal.org to drupal 7 making

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
improvements on various things

moves to drupal 7.

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
not just moving to drupal 7 but actually

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
taking advantage of drupal 7 in the

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
process so

what i do ken record i have a five-digit

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
user number on drupal.org which is

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
actually a badge of honor

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,240
which is great i do work for a company

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,200
called palantir.net we're out of chicago

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
we are distributed

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,320
i am agent rickard on almost every piece

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,640
of social media including drupal.org

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
you can find me on the web uh i have

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
been around for a long long time

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,160
i actually have to lis i have to update

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,640
this list i've been to 13 drupalcons

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,519
13 okay it's not that impressive i've

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,480
been to all three of these

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
right i helped write a book this is my

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
shameful plug

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,279
drupal 7 module development which is

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
sort of manuals on things they won't

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,880
tell you it's it's really five of us at

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
palantir talking about really really

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,839
difficult topics

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,959
um i wrote two chapters including the

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
only thing that's ever been written

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
coherently about the note access system

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,040
in drupal

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,360
and it's a shameful plug because every

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,760
copied sold i get about 88 cents

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,160
so yeah hey um

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,120
i do maintain a lot of projects i'm most

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
famous for the domain access module

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
i have a certified to rock score of

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,399
seven which is decent

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,560
um and i was actually in terms of patch

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,079
contribution i was number 45 on the

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
drupal 7

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,680
contributors list which is actually

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
pretty pretty amazing

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,920
considering that my patch contributions

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
to drupal 7 entirely consisted of

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,800
spending

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,640
three years developing in drupal 6 and

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,880
filing bug reports against things i ran

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
into

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,720
right so we'll talk about that a little

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
bit this is actually the the big chart

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
of contributors to drupal 8 and this is

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
just patch contributors so it's a little

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
bit misleading

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
and there's my little there's my name

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,839
right there so i'm still there

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,000
which is pretty exciting for me

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
i'm gonna talk about really three things

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
today um

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,079
talk a little bit about my personal

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,519
history with drupal i'm going to talk a

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
little bit about the technical history

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,680
of drupal

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,959
with a little bit of a a nod to

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,720
linux and the state of the lamp stack

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,480
during drupal's origins which i think is

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
really kind of fascinating

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
and then i'm going to talk a little bit

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
about drupal 7 and drupal 8 and where

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
it's going

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
and as a reference point for a lot of

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,839
things i'm going to talk about drupal 3

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
and the reason i talk about drupal 3 is

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,000
simply because

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,200
it's the earliest version of drupal

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
that's still available in the git

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
repository

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
and if we really have time in the end

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
i'll show you a working demo of it

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,920
because i've got it running on my laptop

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,200
i am also going to spend a little bit of

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,079
time talking about how important the

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
southeast is to the history of drupal

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,440
and i'm going to do some shout outs to

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,600
some work we did a long time ago

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
i am from augusta georgia i was joking

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,480
with the folks at the hotel here they

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,040
said oh you're on a high floor

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
i was on the 11th floor last night and i

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,279
said

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,040
before they told me i was 11 i was like

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,120
well how high is it she goes well the

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
hotel goes to 18 stories well in augusta

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
our highest building which i used to

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,760
work in

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,440
is 15 stories tall so i'm really excited

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,440
to be on the 11th floor

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
august is the home of james brown it's

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
the home of the augusta national and as

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
i said to folks

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,920
last night at dinner unless you like

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,560
golf there's really no reason to come

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,120
visit i'm sorry to say

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
we we do however have a great triathlon

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,279
so if you're into that kind of thing

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,959
it's awesome um i used to work for a

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,880
company called morris communications

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,240
when i worked there morris's

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
headquarters in august and when i worked

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
there

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,800
this was the map of everything we owned

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,639
they're a newspaper radio company here

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,079
in north carolina they own

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,680
fairway outdoor advertising big

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,120
billboard company which i think they've

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
actually sold off since then

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,200
and i'll point out that i used to work

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,120
in a place that was a huge company we

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
were actually undergoing a

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
transformation onto sap while i was

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,160
there which was really painful

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,000
we did everything in oracle we had linux

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
servers for some stuff

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,760
but i remember our sysadmins wouldn't

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
let us put php on a public-facing web

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,279
server

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,279
um until well i forced them to do it in

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,920
about 2006.

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,839
but i came out of a big iron big

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,279
enterprise kind of thing we have

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,680
in one of our buildings we had basically

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,560
a three million dollar data center

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,440
right some of the folks that i used to

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,839
work with

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
knew how to program on punch cards which

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
was kind of fun

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
and a lot of our folks actually used to

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
work at the savannah river nuclear site

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
we got a lot of

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,040
computer engineers who had experience at

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,720
the nuclear site and i did a talk about

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,639
this in barcelona a long time ago

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,240
you talk about the sort of culture clash

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,839
between um

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
i'll get to it in a second the culture

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,519
clash between the folks who were doing

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,959
open source development and the kind of

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,360
folks who work at a nuclear

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,160
you know decontamination and development

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
facility

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,240
where failure is really not an option

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
and so i actually grew up in an

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,839
environment i was a webmaster first and

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,839
then i went into the sort of r d

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,920
arm at the national headquarters and

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,519
i've been working on the web since 1998

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,760
and i worked for a guy named bob gilbert

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,639
and bob was a really smart guy

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,320
and bob was really frustrated because we

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,880
had all this big iron we were doing

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,160
you know really slow things it turns out

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
at morris we had developed

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,639
our own proprietary c-based scripting

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,639
language

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
stay with me for a second proprietary

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,279
c-based scripting language whose sole

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,240
purpose was to allow web developers

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,560
to write queries to oracle in a safe way

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,800
and format the output

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,360
and what does that sound like to you

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,920
yeah we we invented a clone of php at

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
the same time as php did not open source

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,079
it

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,199
and it caused us all kinds of headaches

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,480
number one if you needed new

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,480
functionality you had to get a c

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,959
engineer to write it for you

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,199
because the tags didn't exist number two

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,519
we couldn't really hire anybody to write

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,680
code for it because it doesn't look good

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,279
on a resume we had all kinds of messes

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,760
so bob is looking at this and we're

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:36,399
trying to build this is in 2004

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:39,920
2004 2005 we're trying to build a cms

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,839
in our proprietary scripting language

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,720
yeah how many people have done that

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,160
before yeah okay

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,440
three yeah yes um so so bob used to work

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
at a company called great bridge great

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,399
bridge

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,760
was a spectacular failure in the early

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,360
2000s

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,040
it was massive post-grad sql replication

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,800
they actually hired so like five of the

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
top postgres developers and they were

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,639
going to do

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,440
essentially you know cloud-based sql

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,920
storage

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,240
before that was even a thing it failed

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,480
spectacularly but at one point

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
he caught the open source bug because

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
his exposure to the postgres community

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,880
really changed his mind and he turned to

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
me one day

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,160
and he said look we're trying to build

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,199
this cms in our own framework

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,399
and it's a disaster right it's too slow

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,880
i mean

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,720
the the functionality was too slow but

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,160
the development was too slow and he

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
looks at me and he said i want you to

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
make us

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
faster and to do that he gave me a copy

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,839
of this book how many people have read

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
this book

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,480
this is eric raymond's the cathedral in

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
the bazaar all right everybody in the

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,880
room gets homework

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
especially the young students in the

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
room you need to go get yourself a copy

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
of the cathedral and the bazaar what is

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
the cathedral and the bazaar

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,360
is eric raymond's history of the

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,800
development of linux it's contrasted

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,079
with the history of the development of

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
windows

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,920
the very simple thesis of this book is

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,680
there are two basic methods of software

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,600
development there is the cathedral and

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,199
in the cathedral model there is one

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,480
large central authority that tells

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,199
everyone else what to do and how to

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,639
behave

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,040
and you must get the cathedral's

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,040
approval to do anything

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,199
microsoft being the cathedral in the

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
bazaar the traders market the farmers

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,399
market where you just go and sort of

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,320
haggle for what you want you get what

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,440
you need and you go do your thing

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,639
that's the linux model right raymond's

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,600
argument essentially is

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
the bazaar is always going to win and if

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
you go around this

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
this conference or see some of the

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,639
things work with some of the things that

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,519
are on this board here

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,120
um you'll know i think we'll all agree

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,000
that the bizarre the open source

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,519
movement has won

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
and i do long talks about this but i

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,680
think this is really important

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,120
groundwork

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,120
for how we got into drupal and why

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
drupal has been successful

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,639
so when i talk about this culture clash

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
this is rasmus lurdorf

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,839
the inventor of php this is one of his

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,320
classic slides he uses this in

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,240
almost all of his talks and i love it

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,079
but this was the sort of attitude that

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
bob wanted to instill in me and this is

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,959
why we adopted drupal in the first place

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
i'm there it's

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,920
late 2004 and i'm looking at

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,240
cms frameworks

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,039
and there weren't a whole lot out there

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
but it was

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,439
precisely for this reason so that we

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,120
could start doing some experimentation

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,559
right what happens if we try this what

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,760
happens if we try that what happens if

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,240
we you know

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,120
without having to involve half the

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,520
company

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,799
and excuse me some very expensive quite

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,679
frankly c engineers

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,360
so this is my southeast shout out this

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,440
is bluffton today bluffton south

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,280
carolina anybody know where that is

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,600
anybody bluffton is most famous for

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
being across the bay from hilton head

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,960
bluffton is actually a booming

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
metropolis these days largely because

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
hilton head is full

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,559
this is actually one of the few

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,360
newspaper success stories of the last

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,120
decade

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,200
because the folks in savannah looked

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,760
around and said bluffton is going to

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,440
explode let's found a newspaper there

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,039
this is the first newspaper website

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,679
launched on drupal

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,000
this is from 2005. we built this i think

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,880
we built the prototype in drupal 4.5 the

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
actual launch

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,160
i think we did launch it in 4.5 and then

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,160
upgraded it pretty quickly to 4.6

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,760
bluffton today was first savannah now

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,600
was second

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
back in 2006 i'm running around

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,559
drupalcon vancouver with a laptop

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,919
version of this thing

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,600
this is in drupal 4.6 and at the time

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,760
everybody at drupalcon was trying to get

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,160
drupal 4.7 out the door

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,679
right but me i come from this attitude

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
of i'm one of the early enterprise

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,480
adopters in drupal

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,320
and i i was literally at vancouver to

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,120
validate the fact that we had

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,000
decided to launch a very important

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
property

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
on drupal and that it wasn't going to

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,039
kill us

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,200
right i was there doing research as

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,720
they're doing r d i had our i had our

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
the guy who headed up

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,120
all of our um development he was in

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,960
charge of the oracle systems he was in

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,240
charge of the the proprietary system he

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
was in charge of the assisted men's he

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
was in charge of everything

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,160
i had him in tow with me to basically

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,520
see that this was not a crazy idea

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,200
he still thought it was a crazy idea

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
but it was hilarious to me because the

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,160
everybody i talked to was like oh you

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,280
have to build this in 4.7 you have to do

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
it in 4.7

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
and my answer at the time was yeah but

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,640
you guys are still in alpha it's not

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
even going to be in beta for four months

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,520
there's no way i can go back to my

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,720
multi-million dollar corporation and

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,039
tell them oh yeah we should use this

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,960
alpha software that would be great

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,480
so yeah it was a bad decision at the

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,640
time it turns out but anyway

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,480
so that's that's where i come from now

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
sort of parallel to my career this is

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
funny

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,799
this is a classic photo of dress

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
boychart dresses the drupal product

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,000
project lead this is actually a hard

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,520
photo to get a hold of this is

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,600
in fact someone's picture of a screen

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
from a presentation that he did probably

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,919
in london

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,600
this is dries in college so in 1998 i'm

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,360
down in arkansas i'm working for morris

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
i'm a newspaper webmaster i'm building

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
websites by hand

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,480
actually we were building by hand and we

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,799
had a custom rigged filemaker pro

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,840
database that would spit out html for us

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,799
it was awesome so at the same time

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,080
dries you know he's in college he's

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
working with his friends

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,200
and he has some ideas and it's funny and

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,559
you can read this on your own this is

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
the sort of official history of the

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,840
drupal project

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,840
on drupal.org dries was a java engineer

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,120
if you didn't know that drives has a phd

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:19,360
actually in computer science and his his

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,760
thesis is on garbage collection in java

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,120
and he and his buddies were all computer

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,320
you know computer science

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,559
majors and they were at the university

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
of ghent and they wanted to help

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,600
communicate um they were also i think

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,280
trying to get around some very

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,559
restrictive wi-fi policies at the

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,200
university so they were

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,880
sort of bundling some stuff on and they

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,280
just started they built a message board

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,440
the first version of drupal actually

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,919
dropped.org is essentially a clone of

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,480
slashdot that's what they wanted they

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,880
built a clone of slashdot and

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
it was an attempt to experiment right

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
this whole

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,360
rasmus laird off fail fast fail cheap um

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
don't repeat yourself thing

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,720
so they experimented with all kinds of

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
interesting stuff including feed

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,200
aggregation because rss was

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,640
fairly recent at the time they tried to

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,159
write a search algorithm they tried to

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
write a bunch of stuff

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,880
and we're going to sort of talk about

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,159
the next bit is what did they get right

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
and what did they get wrong and

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,520
what legacy of this experimentation

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,360
still is with us today oh

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,280
this is this is um

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,559
a working clone of drop.org that one of

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,480
my co-workers found

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,039
um give you sort of the landscape of

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,280
that

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,720
the 1.0 version of drupal comes out in

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,480
the the 15th of january 2001. 2001

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,000
well what the heck does that mean and

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
why is that important for us today

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,039
that's i think my big question

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
this is a great list of things that

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,080
didn't exist when

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,080
drupal first came out

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
there was no rick rolling either

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,320
comes a little later um these are

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,520
comparable systems this is

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
the stuff that we would consider

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,320
drupal's peers or its competitors in the

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
marketplace

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,000
there is no wordpress yet there is no

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,480
joomla mambo is just

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,320
about to be released i remember actually

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,280
i started looking at cms's before the

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,919
big mambo joomla split

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,280
the schism movable type was about to

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,440
come out movable type was

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
pretty big at the time about a year

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,039
later

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,080
plone isn't out yet typo 3 is out typo 3

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,480
actually

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,760
is still a big use in germany not so

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,799
much here in the united states

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,320
php newt comes out at the same time

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,679
has anyone ever used php nuke really

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
i i don't think i've ever met anyone who

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,080
admitted that but

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,280
and then dot net nuke which is the three

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
scariest things i've ever heard

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,280
hey let's cobble together a system and

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,960
then port it to asp

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,880
okay um so he comes up with drop.org

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,320
drop.org is funny because it's a typo he

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,440
was actually trying to

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,360
register a domain dorpia dorpio.org

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,720
dorpia being a dutch for little village

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
dutch is a cute language you can add

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,520
like yeah at the end of anything and

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,760
make it small

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,200
like so i i met a dutch guy years ago

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,799
and it's like yo you got a snickers bar

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,919
and then there's the stickers yet

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,440
what the little mini snickers so he he

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,880
typoed the domain name and ended up with

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
drop.org because it's like you know the

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
year 2000 you could still accidentally

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,679
get domain names that were cool

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,760
right so drop.org um i love this

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,200
this is um this is the administrative

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,400
back end of the

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
drupal 3 actually

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,159
i wouldn't laugh that much this is the

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:34,480
administrative backend of drupal 7.

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:37,520
right this is the content administration

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,440
page of drupal 3

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,039
and the content administration page of

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,240
drupal 7. it's just a little

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:48,960
shinier i mean there's some filter stuff

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,880
right and what's this page

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
the permission screen which hasn't

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,279
changed well it's got headers on it now

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,480
i'm not even going to show you but

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,320
some of the one of the interesting

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
things to me about drupal it's early

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
origins

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
uh some of its foundations are actually

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,880
solid enough that they're still in

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,000
in play some of their foundations are

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
kind of

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,279
crumbling and we need to replace them

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,880
and we'll get to that in a little bit

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,799
but there are a couple of baseline

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,200
assumptions in here and the first one

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,039
actually is a slide i took out

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,640
is that the reason we have drupal to

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,159
begin with is the sort of fundamental

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,520
reason of all open source

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,440
which is somebody had a problem that

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,120
they wanted to solve right that's

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
scratch your own itch mentality

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,240
it's one of the reasons people are at

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,760
events like self

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,000
right is so you can learn to solve

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
problems for yourself i have

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
i would love to get into richard

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,039
stallman and xerox and all the history

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
of gnu and all that stuff but i don't

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,080
have time

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,919
but dries is coming out of that same

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,679
background hey i've got a problem i want

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,400
to solve it

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,919
okay some of the other great assumptions

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,720
the assumption in the early version of

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,919
drupal is that

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
you're not going to have any anonymous

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,200
site visitors essentially that it's

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,720
all people communicating with one

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,120
another that you're expected to interact

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,640
posts are moderated there are different

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,679
data structures for different content

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,039
types i think the

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
out of the box it shipped with three

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,720
content types which is kind of

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
interesting

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,200
administration was separate that's

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,000
important the user permission system

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,520
actually has not changed much at all i

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
think is a big deal

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
there were a lot of tools to help you

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
find and edit your content and manage

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,559
your own content

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,080
and there's this this last one here

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,320
there is this big assumption that users

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
have technical competency

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
that has been a problem historically as

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,679
drupal has gotten larger and

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,480
we'll talk about that as we have time so

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,919
my other point is okay so why why do we

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,440
want to delve into any of this history

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,960
why is it important as a sort of

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
grounding especially i mean how many of

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
you folks this is your first drupal

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,880
event

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
about a third of you well welcome

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,679
what do i want to say about that

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,720
this is the the graph basically of the

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,400
number of people uh

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,640
attributed to commit co attributed

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,480
to have contributed code to different

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,440
drupal versions and i started drupal 3

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,799
which has like six people listed there's

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,320
six core developers

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,360
uh and on the last one that slide where

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,559
i was number 45 yay me

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,000
we had about 900. for drupal 8 we're

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,720
already somewhere over

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,720
1500 i think yeah

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,559
this slide is actually old i need to

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,240
update it at the time i did this slide

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,559
this is the sheer number of people just

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,840
registered on drupal.org right which

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,520
went from about

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,320
10. and if you ever find someone with a

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,159
with a

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,360
a one or two digit drupal id you should

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,480
buy them

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,919
a beverage of their choice

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,880
see that's code of conduct right there

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,360
doug yeah there you go

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,799
a beverage of their choice and you

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,320
should ask them politely what they would

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,720
what they would like to drink

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,159
um i'll tell you why that's funny maybe

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
later if i dare

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,679
um but recently i mean we passed a

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,400
quarter million users on drupal.org

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,400
they're

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,240
right now actually probably close to a

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,240
million and that's just the people who

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
bother to register there is sort of a

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,559
silent

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,240
legion of drupal users that are not

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,559
accounted for

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,360
that is very very fascinating and the

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,760
the

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,120
wider adoption i mean just the sharpness

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,880
of this curve this is a

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,399
essentially an eight-year timeline the

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
sharpness of this curve is actually

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,799
pretty

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,919
interesting and a little bit scary to

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,159
some of us

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,640
now i say that because this is a photo

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,200
from drupal camp what's the capital of

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,559
belgium

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,760
um no

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,039
brussels this is drupal camp brussels in

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,640
in 2006 and this is the entire camp and

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,480
it's small enough that i can actually

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,000
look at the photo and pull out specific

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,200
people like this is angie byron right

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,919
here front and center maintainer of

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
drupal 7

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,200
and most awesome person in the history

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,200
of everything right

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,640
this is a picture of drupalcon denver

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,679
where there were 3 500 people

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,880
right there is a very very very

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,799
huge difference between this community

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,399
right which is about equivalent to the

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,679
number of people in this room

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,720
right think about how hard it would be

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:22,080
for all of us to agree on something

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,320
make a plan for moving forward right now

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,840
multiply that by you know a factor of 15

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,480
and that's just the people who can come

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,399
who can attend

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,799
so there are some very interesting

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,480
issues facing the drupal community

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,000
the documentation and support i think

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,360
are at the top of that list

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
pretty much always especially for those

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,399
of you who are new to drupal and might

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:47,600
be going oh my god what am i doing right

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,799
what do i do now i i had a fascinating

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,120
conversation with

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,720
with someone um they were paying me to

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,399
have but a fascinating conversation with

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
someone on thursday and she asked a very

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,720
innocent question

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,640
well how do i do this i said well

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,840
they're two difficult ways to do it or

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,360
there's an easy way to do it

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,279
write it using this feature that i wrote

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,039
for views module and she didn't even

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,159
know the feature existed

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
even though she was using the views

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,480
module it's like oh okay so there's some

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,200
some assumptions also this is the other

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,399
interesting thing there's some

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,080
assumptions that those of us who have

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,360
been around for a long time

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,559
i just had my seventh drupal anniversary

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,240
there are some assumptions that we have

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,440
including that technical competency

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,360
assumption

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
that aren't necessarily true and this

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,200
causes problems

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
so documentation support usability

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,840
technical debt

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,919
is a huge problem at this point in

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,039
drupal code patterns which is

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,240
basically how are we going to write

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,440
things why are we going to write them in

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,279
certain ways

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,320
performance and scalability community

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,039
identity this is where all that

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,720
drupalcon code of conduct comes in

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,760
and this drupal 8 development cycle so

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,880
these are some of the things we're going

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
to we're going to touch on

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,000
and i've got to stop and check time too

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,960
so

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
all right we're good on time

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,440
one of the things i do want to say is

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,159
why is drupal still here i actually have

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,120
a slide that i

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,880
i took out that shows there's like six

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,559
hooks in drupal 3 that still exist

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,000
there's like six functions in group

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,559
three that have been not been changed at

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,399
all

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,640
um but the hook model actually worked

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,600
the hook model

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,840
gave an incredible amount of flexibility

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,080
to drupal as a system and

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,480
for novice developers like myself at the

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,000
time in particular gave a very easy

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,240
entree

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,480
into how to do complex things one of the

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,159
first sessions i ever went to in drupal

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,159
was adrian whose last name i can never

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,760
pronounce

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,120
anyway one of the first sessions i ever

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,640
went to was essentially here are the

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,600
four hooks you need to do to write a

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,919
module

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,520
it was fascinating and it sort of walked

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
you through how to do it

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,960
so hooks i mean syndication data

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,720
separation persistent variables which

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,520
was actually a problem when when drupal

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,120
got written

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,640
the theme overrides which is what i was

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,640
talking to someone about the other day

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,760
sql protection which was all built in

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,360
you know page casting

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,720
translations all of this stuff existed

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,799
in the early versions of drupal right

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,559
which i think is kind of fascinating and

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,000
this is my nod to hey we're at a linux

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,000
festival let's talk about lamp

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,799
and why that's a big deal because i said

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,080
before early drupal comes out in 2001

00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:17,440
php4 isn't stable until the 23rd of june

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,159
drupal up until 4.5 i believe still

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,679
supported php 3

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,760
which makes sense for some interesting

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,000
compromises in terms of the code

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,640
the same thing is true of mysql mysql4

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
isn't stable in 2001. right we still

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,919
supported mysql 3

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,760
through drupal 4 7 i believe

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,320
right i think we dropped support from my

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,880
sequel three like five years ago

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,640
which is kind of interesting um apache

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,919
and i don't know anything about apache

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,919
but i put these numbers on here in case

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,440
they're of interest to you um and linux

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,519
these are the linux

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
versions that are out and stable at the

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,600
time and i don't even know what we're on

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,080
now

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,360
because i'm not a big linux guy and this

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,799
is one of the

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,039
i love this slide this is one of the

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,480
consequences of that timeline

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,080
right how do you do persistent variable

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,320
storage why does drupal have this

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,360
these variables tables all this well the

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,279
define statement which is used to define

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,960
string variables and things doesn't even

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,360
freaking exist

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,840
i said freaking can i say that now say

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,440
it straight to the camera freaking

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,360
define one of these sort of fundamental

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,159
constructs that we think about

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,679
isn't even in the language at the time

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,120
all right you can see we abused the heck

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,720
out of it now

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,320
but i i find that sort of fascinating

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,519
and the other thing that people always

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,600
point to in drupal they're like why

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,679
isn't it more object oriented why why

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
why well you have to point at php3 for

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,480
the answer to that

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,919
all this object inheritance this is

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,000
actually paid straight out of the php

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,519
online manual

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,120
php's object oriented support really

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,399
doesn't kick into gear

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,799
until php5 and a lot of people will tell

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,120
you

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,720
doesn't really get complete until php

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,080
5.4 which isn't even

00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,440
out yet it's in testing

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,000
right so we have some very interesting

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
problems

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,399
and i i like this slide also because

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,039
there are a lot of objects and classes

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,720
in drupal 7 now and drupal 8's going to

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,919
go even further in that direction

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,679
in fact there's some fundamental

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,679
architecture being rewritten in an

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,200
object-oriented mode

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,840
but it surprised me to find out that

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:25,840
there were actually 17 classes

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,840
in drupal 3. and guess where they are

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:33,039
they're in the theme layer

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,720
they're in the theme layer because

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,320
drupal at the very beginning these guys

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,679
were they were back-end developers they

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,399
weren't they're java developers they're

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,159
you know

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,360
interested in databases and things they

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,159
weren't real interested in front-end

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,919
presentation

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,399
and they thought that doing a class

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,600
would be the easiest way to explain

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,159
to html authors

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,840
how to influence the look and feel of

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,039
presentation and i i say they weren't

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,720
really design oriented

00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,000
because these are the themes that ship

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,120
with drupal 3

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,120
yeah and they awesome

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,559
one of them has like a really bragging

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,879
comment in the header too that's like

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,919
this is the totally awesome theme and

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,960
like yeah okay hey it was

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,679
it was a long time ago um but it's it's

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,000
kind of fascinating

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,760
and we got away from this actually it's

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,200
interesting because user and node are

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,320
classes

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,800
full classes in drupal 3 but only

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,760
recently did we commit the patch to

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
drupal 8

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,919
to make all entities proper

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,119
objects they're now node is no longer a

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,399
standard class object it is now its own

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,720
class hooray which can make people's

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,760
lives a lot easier these are new

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,000
concepts since

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,839
drupal came out right we've had to adapt

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,720
to them jquery being a huge

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,800
huge boon to the community there's a big

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,720
move going on right now to integrate

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,400
drupal with other systems

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,320
and i think that's really important

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,920
wysiwyg editors is on this list i mean

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,520
yes they were desktop wysiwygs but the

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,160
idea that you should be able to put a

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,200
wysiwyg

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,359
into your web editor is

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,320
is fairly radical or was at the time

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,640
simple test comes in

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
exception handling right because php

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,599
didn't support it

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,880
at the time um open id php file all this

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,920
stuff

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,680
um totally new to drupal so there's some

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
some foundational i want to say some

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,640
sort of foundational assumptions about

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,240
how drupal was built

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,599
that we've had to change and adapt to

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,040
pretty radically and we've as a

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,560
community actually done pretty pretty

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,839
pretty well about that the big one

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,680
that's coming down and if you hear

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,240
anyone

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,800
who's on the drupal 8 development team

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,480
uh

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,960
talk about it mobile is the big one

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,440
that's coming that's scaring everybody

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,200
mobile changes the entire game uh there

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,520
are there are studies out that suggest

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
that

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,640
you know within five years something

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,079
like 80 of all web traffic is going to

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,480
be coming out of mobile

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,839
right and the era of the desktop website

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,040
is just done

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,960
right what's drupal built for it's built

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,880
for generating desktop websites

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,079
right so these are some of the things

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,440
that have come up as

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,240
as a response these are sort of cool new

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,920
concepts in drupal um

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,800
things that did not exist when it got

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,240
started that i think are fun

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,000
my favorite of which if you've never

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,520
played with file stream rappers they're

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,960
awesome

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,640
nerd nerd thing file stream wrappers

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,400
well i don't have time to get into it

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,440
but they're awesome

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,960
um but again the foundational concepts

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,160
have always been there

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,359
this is another one of those things

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
that's fascinating to me these are the

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,960
instructions from drupal 3 about how to

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,280
install a second language

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,240
because drupal is now and has always

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,160
been english

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,160
first which is very odd when you

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,800
consider that its originators were in

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,640
ghent in belgium and they all spoke

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,040
dutch natively

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,079
and i asked dries at one point i said

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,800
why is drupal written in english

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,040
why is adding dutch an afterthought and

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,400
he said well it's a web application and

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,400
websites are built in english

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,480
now and and i make this point when we

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,000
talk about culture

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,359
culture issues in drupal and getting

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,760
along with other folks and understanding

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,200
that

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,960
there are a number of european

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,240
contributors to drupal the european

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
community is thriving

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,760
we're you know building up support in

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,520
the asian community and we're having

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,800
the first latin american drupalcon this

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,320
year is going to be down in brazil

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,040
in december and it's interesting

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,800
to me that we've sort of all had always

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,800
had support for multi-language

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,480
but i think if drupal had been invented

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
in the united united states

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,560
like say wordpress or plone or anything

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,079
like that

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,920
well not plone excuse me wordpress is a

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,520
good example though

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,160
if an american had invented drupal i

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,839
don't think it would have been

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,839
multilingual out of the box

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,359
and when we talk about innovation this

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,560
is my simple innovation slide those are

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,920
the instructions for how to get

00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,200
translations up and running on your old

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,200
thing was essentially

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,640
download this file and then run this sql

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,480
executable

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,400
we have a much more sophisticated way to

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,160
handle file translation now

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
which is an example of the type of

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,560
innovation that's gone on as the

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,800
community has gotten

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,839
broader what i want to say about that

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,000
however is

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,280
as the community has gotten larger and

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
drupal has been

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,720
adapting to the new demands have been

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,560
put on it

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,160
some things have happened these are the

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,599
the number of database tables that get

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,280
installed with a default

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,760
drupal installation you can see they've

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,640
more than doubled

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,839
this is the fun the fun slides of

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,079
numbers

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,720
total number of files including

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,040
javascript files and all that good stuff

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,720
has exploded that's four times as many

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,760
files

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,359
and if we get views in core well that's

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,240
just going to add some more code weight

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,839
1.3 megs to 13 megs that's kind of

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,000
interesting

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,079
my my rough estimate of the number of

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,680
lines of code in all of drupal

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,839
i do put an asterisk on this thing this

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,440
includes comments and blank lines

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:08,320
um yeah almost 300 000 lines of code

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,320
in drupal 7.

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,240
yeah and there's a cost to all that

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,839
i don't have the emphasis everyone has

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,800
seen the infamous drupal

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,880
learning curve slide it's a curve that

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,680
goes like this and then it loops back on

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,599
itself

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,280
there are people there are people

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,640
falling off the edge of it

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,720
i i don't have this but this is an older

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,760
nicer version of that slide that the

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,920
increased complexity

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,440
does add some barriers to enter to entry

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
if you are a developer it can be very

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,240
very confusing to figure out where

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,359
you're going to start

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,079
what can you do and what are you

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,200
interested in and this is a great old

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,720
slide about um

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,400
you know how competent are you

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,320
but this is developer centric

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,760
so some of the things that have gone on

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,520
in the community that i think are pretty

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,000
awesome that we should point out

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,400
are big victories coding standards if

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,960
you look through the drupal 3 code base

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,800
there are no coding standards there are

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,280
tab spaces all over the place some of

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,200
the

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,839
files are in windows format some of them

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,119
are in unix format

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,280
it's kind of a mess there's automated

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,599
testing there's user experience

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,359
testing there's accessibility testing

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,599
which is a big new thing for us

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,880
documentation standards we have starter

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,440
themes to help you get up and running

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,800
faster

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,000
we have drupal cons which are new we

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,079
have drupal camps that are new and

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,160
drupal camps in particular are all about

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,599
helping onboard people into drupal

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,880
helping get you more involved

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,480
and the idea behind getting you more

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,280
involved is to make you more productive

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
at whatever your

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,319
you know whatever problem you're trying

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,240
to solve right because

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,920
the great lesson of course is that

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,119
you're probably not trying to solve a

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,400
problem that a hundred people haven't

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,839
already tried to solve

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,839
right there are almost no unique

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,760
problems in software development

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,920
there are probably no unique problems in

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,880
website deployment and development

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,560
and so if you can interact with the

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,079
community they can help you out

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,880
and i have eight minutes

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,400
one last lovely slide about what are the

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,960
effects of these kinds of initiatives

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,400
yeah we have what is that 10 times as

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,000
many functions in drupal as we used to

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,040
however this is this is the the list of

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,839
number of functions that have been

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,160
documented

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,079
in drupal 3 there is no inline code

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,280
documentation

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,920
none no no doxygen blocks none of that

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,119
stuff

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,520
this is my great map of yeah 98

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,040
of all drupal 7 functions have proper

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,520
documentation

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,880
right from which we generate well this

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,240
is my example this is

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,839
a drupal 3 request so it's funny when i

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,440
say there's what you know 300

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,520
000 lines of code well this is you know

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,160
like a 12 lines of comment

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,200
for three lines of functioning code

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,680
which just makes

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,319
maintenance it breathes because oh this

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,760
explains everything that's going on here

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,359
and then we can generate great api

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,800
documentation so projects like this

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,240
initiatives like this

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,880
help make us all more successful so when

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,480
we talk about drupal when we talk about

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,000
in particular you know where do you fit

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,520
in the drupal ecosystem

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,160
i said earlier that there is sort of a

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,760
vast legion of anonymous folks

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,280
right people who don't interact with the

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
community they don't necessarily

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
contribute back

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,520
and they may be perfectly happy and they

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,920
may be

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,040
getting by with their drupal day to day

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,119
but i would point out

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,040
you know and encourage you to look

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,040
through the type of things that are on

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
on this list the type of roles that are

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,640
on this list things that are very very

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
important

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,920
and i'm actually going to start at the

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,040
bottom because to me at the bottom i'm

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,520
going to start the last thing i entered

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,200
here

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,880
marketers we actually need marketers

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,960
right now we need folks who can help

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,000
with drupal marketing we need folks who

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,599
can help us

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
stay on message we need folks who can

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,079
help us craft the message better

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,560
and generally present our image better

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,240
it's an

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,760
interesting challenge that no one

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,520
thought about eight years ago

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,359
right how do we market things we need

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,599
more developers oh lord we need more

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,520
developers

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,800
is there a great time by the way bad bad

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,359
job job market

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
not in the drupal space if you know php

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,000
and you're

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,119
a nice human being you can get a job

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,520
trust me

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,200
you can ask me later i'm hiring i'm sure

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,119
a lot of other folks here are too

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,400
we need more designers we in particular

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,680
and i've started saying this in the

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,599
issue cues for the modules that i

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,200
maintained i say this a lot to people

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,720
hey that's a great idea for a new

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,880
feature can you please sketch out how

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,119
you'd like that to work

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,880
like in the user interface because it's

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,000
an easy technical problem to solve

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,520
but how is it going to look so designer

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,319
is a big deal you know folks who build

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,000
sites

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,200
we want to make sure that the changes

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,960
we're making to drupal we want to make

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,760
sure that what we're contributing

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,160
is making life easier for people there

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,160
are business owners there are trainers

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,440
all this stuff there are sort of formal

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,040
roles in the drupal community they're

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,760
core maintainers there are contrib

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,520
maintainers

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,880
there's a dedicated security team if you

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,480
did not know

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,000
the dedicated security team does a great

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,880
job they do security announcements every

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,400
wednesday

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,319
they do have a coordinated security

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,160
release bit there is a formal

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,680
documentation team that always needs

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,680
help

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,960
it's a great way to start considering

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,640
contributing to drupal

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,480
the accessibility team needs some help

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,839
too and the user experience team i know

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,000
always need some help

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,440
they are doing some fabulous work though

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,880
so what i would encourage you to do is

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,960
sort of find

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,079
what interests you what do you care

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,520
about and

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,200
you know if you're a developer day to

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,800
day it could just be

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,079
if you find that thing that makes you

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,760
bang your head against the wall because

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,040
drupal always makes you write code to

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,640
work around it

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,160
write a patch to fix it i've written

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,200
several several of those

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,839
several of those there's a big movement

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,400
right now to simplify

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,200
and standardize the javascript layer in

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,640
drupal

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,760
because our javascript is a little bit

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,520
of a mess there's a big move to simplify

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,400
the css in drupal because it's a bit of

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,079
a mess too

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,079
there's a lot of it was written by folks

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,040
who that's not really their

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,480
core competency that is not to denigrate

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,760
those folks who have worked very hard on

00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,280
that code it's just to say

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,040
there are people we know could write it

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,720
better and if you're one of them

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,400
please please help us write it better

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,839
so i am going to switch at the very end

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,359
here and talk about drupal 8.

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:15,760
they're all scared drupal 8.

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,480
and i'll make this last last pitch about

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,599
the keynote

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,280
if i had been truly lazy uh

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,680
angie byron webchick was nice enough to

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,119
make a drupal 8 slide deck available

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,720
so if you want to do a keynote or if you

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,480
want to talk about drupal 8 just like

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,920
you could fill an hour with just her

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,359
slides and

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:37,760
no i just took a couple so anyway

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,480
um whatever yeah

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,359
why are how many of you are on drupal 6

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,079
by the way

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,880
still and i sort of am a little bit how

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,720
many of you are on dribble 7

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,480
okay how many of you have touched drupal

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,560
8.

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,760
okay drupal 8 is going to be a

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,280
fascinating release and i

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,560
i will say this to sort of ease your

00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,920
mind uh the life cycle for drupal 7 will

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,920
probably extend at least to 2015

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,680
right the support life cycle and it

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,720
might extend beyond that because enough

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,000
people are going to be using it as a

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,640
stable platform for a

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,520
long time so i wouldn't worry too much

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,040
however

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,960
there's some really interesting things

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,119
going on in the drupal 8 space

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,960
there are five major initiatives going

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,520
on and we'll talk about them all

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,960
very briefly what's funny to me is i i

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,079
either work with or used to work with

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,079
three of those five people

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,480
number one is the configuring

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,240
configuration management initiative

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,720
and for those of you who are into devops

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,839
or going to robert ristof's talk about

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,880
jenkins this is

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,480
high on your list of priorities

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,880
one of the problems with drupal's legacy

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,040
system of course is that

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,880
your configuration variables and your

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,280
your content are all sort of mixed

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,359
together in a very

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,960
uh loose way let's call it so the

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,760
configuration management initiative

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,000
are actually folks actively working on

00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,200
how

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,680
to make that standardized and there's

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,400
some very interesting

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,920
work being done here i can't even really

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,160
explain most of it

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,839
but it basically is the idea is you want

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,400
to be able to export configuration to

00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,480
code

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,079
and push it to from machine to machine

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,359
features module does a lot of this i

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,079
know someone's doing a talk about

00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,640
features

00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,640
this morning

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,200
but they're going to put this into core

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,040
and we're going to try very hard

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,839
actually to put

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:31,359
a content configuration api into core as

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,599
well i know that's a huge effort

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,200
the other huge initiative that's going

00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,640
on is what's called

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,079
whiskey and i can't even remember what

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,440
whiskey stands for but i can tell you

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,760
what it does

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,559
we had said i said before that drupal

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,400
was built

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,839
for producing desktop websites but

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,599
everything is going mobile well the

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,800
problem is if you look at the way drupal

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,280
pages are generated

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,720
they are deliberately designed to spit

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,880
out html

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,319
the whiskey initiative is designed to

00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,800
break that pattern

00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,200
by redoing drupal's menu and routing

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,440
system so that requests can be returned

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,720
in different formats

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,119
based on the internal

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,680
based on the nature of the request right

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,680
the idea is

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,800
publish once publish everywhere

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,839
using internal apis and the part about

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,040
that that's really interesting if you

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,680
how many people have heard of the

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,599
symphony stuff that's going on

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,960
okay larry garfield who's reading the

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,400
leading this initiative

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,040
krell on irc and and on drupal.org

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,640
was it symphony live this week making

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,520
nice with the symphony folks over in

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,440
paris

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,760
uh because the foundation for what he

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,400
wants to do and this is a huge leap for

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,599
drupal

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,720
the foundation for this type of of bit

00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,160
is proper http request handling which is

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,079
a problem that has already been solved

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,079
by the symphony team

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,440
right there are elements of what we call

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,000
the kernel patch that have already

00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,440
landed

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,559
there are elements of symphony that are

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,559
going into drupal core

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,319
which is really really fascinating

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,440
because we're starting to

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,000
cross-pollinate with

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,040
with symphony which is essentially a

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,240
standardized

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,880
uh php library php component library

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,119
the way we standardize on jquery so this

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,200
is a giant leap for us it's actually

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,040
a very healthy sign the drupal community

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,800
uh and in fact i can say that the

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,000
overall plan the symphony folks were

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,760
planning to build their own

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
content management system on top of

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,839
symfony and they're trying to abandon

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,839
that plan and just use drupal instead

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,079
and we're almost to the end blocks and

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,599
layouts

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,040
the concept if you've used the panels

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,640
module this is another huge initiative

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,839
that's going on chris van der water is

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,839
leading this one

00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,119
the idea of making it so that everything

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,559
is every

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,079
little component of the page you can

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,920
push around and put where you need to

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,599
and output exactly as you want

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,040
it's a fascinating initiative the

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,960
biggest problem with this one actually

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,079
is going to be the user experience it's

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,160
going to be

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,839
the ui design it's going to be the

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,359
single toughest problem to solve

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,760
because if you've ever used panels it's

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,720
lovely and awesome

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,720
and awful to use

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,280
so language handling uh gabor

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,760
hatsey is improving the way language

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,720
works

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,480
he's trying to make it much easier much

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,520
much clearer to developers and much

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,640
easier to

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,319
configure and use for end users if you

00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,440
care about such things i just got off

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,559
the phone with someone who basically

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,559
makes their living

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,920
building multilingual websites in

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,880
english and spanish for the united

00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,640
states government

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,000
so they care deeply about this if that's

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,000
the kind of thing this is a great place

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,599
to dive in

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,760
and then there's this responsive design

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,960
mobile first initiative that's going on

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,200
which is going to change the way

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,079
drupal's output layer is rendered

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,119
how many of you are familiar with

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,800
responsive design responsive design is

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,040
the hot thing these days which

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,000
essentially means instead of having to

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,680
build a separate app

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,040
for things so they work nicely on mobile

00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,480
or having you do a separate mobile

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,319
design and do all kinds of you know

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,079
browser sniffing and things you want to

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:05,920
make your design flexible so that

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,400
it re-renders based on

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,920
the size and capacity of the device that

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,160
the visitor is on

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,760
it's fascinating john alvin who works

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,400
with us at paluteau is

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,680
leading this initiative and has written

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,319
some really good work

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,440
stuff on on how it works and there are a

00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,680
couple of other interesting things that

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,480
go along with that which includes

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,319
full support for html5 which gets a lot

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,119
of people really really excited

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,040
including the new hdmi html5 form

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,119
elements which are sort of necessary

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,160
to make mobile optimization work

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,920
properly

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,440
and then there's another one and this is

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,319
really fascinating how many of you

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,520
people

00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,680
dig around in drupal's theme layer

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,000
how many of you don't like drupal's

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,480
theme layer

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,119
yeah it's about yeah about half the

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,359
folks don't

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,240
so there is a movement of foot to try to

00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,839
adopt twig

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,440
twig is actually the template rendering

00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:00,000
system that um

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,800
symphony uses it's a it's a sister

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,040
project

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,440
uh it's a it's a tangential project to

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,680
symphony and so there is a movement to

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,680
try to bring across

00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,880
what is considered to be by many

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,839
simpler token based syntax so that

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,480
template developers don't have to learn

00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,520
php

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,319
whether or not this is going to make it

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,680
into drupal 8 is an interesting question

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,800
but there's a lot of work being done

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,920
there are some folks who are very very

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,520
excited about it people

00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,760
who you wouldn't think might be excited

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,480
about it twig is great for a couple of

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,960
reasons the

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,040
most notably for developers is security

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,800
because of how it works

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,480
it's also really really fast because

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,839
it's compiled

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,240
that's one of the problems people have

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,160
to solve actually is you take a twig

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,640
template and it actually gets compiled

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,599
into a php executable

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,599
on the web server

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,599
so it can then be put in opcode cache

00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,440
and all that but it's not clear how

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,319
we're going to accomplish that in drupal

00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,280
so there's another big initiative that

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,920
aqueous started about

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,440
in-place editing and other improvements

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,200
to the user experience to make

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,880
content editing easier and i would say

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,119
this is the big note slide you should

00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,280
take there are lots of places to get

00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,960
involved in core development

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,480
there is a team that is dedicated to

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,880
doing mentoring for

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,720
new developers onboarding and you can

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,520
come in that's tuesdays and wednesdays

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,920
in pound drupal on irc

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,559
there are core wind sprints on fridays

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,880
which is

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,079
where folks who are deeply involved in

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,119
core development including the

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,640
initiative leaders

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,920
can walk you through different issues

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,280
they can say if you come in and say hey

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,720
i really want to help on the language

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,640
initiative

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,079
gabor or someone working closely with

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,760
him will say hey well we need you to

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,800
test this thing and tell us if it works

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,559
for you or not

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,960
or we need you to document how this

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,839
works

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,640
so i encourage you all to drop by i

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,880
encourage you

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,400
to get involved because it is of course

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,000
time to start to

00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,599
can i say this anymore i think we can

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,800
say kick ass

00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,160
well you can say kick ass

00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,520
the other thing that i'll point out and

00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,480
this is the thing that most people like

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,960
about drupal

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,000
it is a duocracy it is things get done

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,319
because people take the time

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,280
to do them which basically means anyone

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,440
in this room

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,319
can be a major contributor right anybody

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,480
in this room

00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,319
can take my job and be up here doing

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,559
this keynote right

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,240
and i'll give you an example to leave

00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,839
with i would say a lot of people talk

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,200
about rock stars and ninjas

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,280
and i'm going to argue that there are no

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,319
rock stars this is a slide from

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,839
drupalcon vancouver in 2006 and someone

00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,599
in this picture is about to demo views

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,640
1.0

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,160
it's that guy right this is a blurry

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,280
picture i know but i had no idea who he

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,240
was at the time this is merlin

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,319
chaos wandering around the venue floor

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,440
because he doesn't know anybody

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,960
because no one has ever heard of him

00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,640
and then he goes on to demo the single

00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,720
most important module in the history of

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,319
drupal 10 minutes later

00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,760
right there were like 20 of us in the

00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,520
room and about

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,119
10 minutes in everybody's jaw hit the

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,799
floor and we when we figured out what he

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,040
was trying to do

00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,200
so that was pretty awesome and i will

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,799
say that i mean for myself this is

00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,640
in vancouver the first thing i ever

00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,720
contributed to drupal was a

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,839
card sort card sword is a simple

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,839
somebody knows what those are they're

00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,200
awesome right it's a simple exercise

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,720
designed to help people group things

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,680
into like-minded stuff i showed you the

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,160
administrative

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,359
interface of drupal 3 before up until

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,880
drupal 4.7

00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,680
all the administrative links were in one

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,280
big long page and is in drupal 4.7 that

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,960
we group them into things and that's the

00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,599
card sort that i did it was a card short

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,240
it was me merlin of chaos

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,160
dries and nedjo rogers and nedjo has a

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,839
user id of like seven

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,760
right and i didn't know anybody and

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,079
back up until they changed it in drupal

00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,400
7 but in drupal 4 7 5 and 6. if you ever

00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,720
use the user menu in the admin interface

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,160
that's my fault because i argued for

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,920
that i said no no no this is a whole

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,160
cluster of tasks that are based on who

00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:02,559
your users are

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,400
no code involved here so again

00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,160
there are tasks out there for everyone

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,119
at all skill levels at all interest

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,440
levels i would say

00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,599
that are very very important um and i

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,839
encourage you very heartily to dive into

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,480
that this is how things get done

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,599
the probably the and this is the sort of

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,920
the last thing i've got

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,440
this is dries boychart obviously the the

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,200
project lead this is

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,520
chicks um karoy

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,119
nejesi whose name i cannot pronounce one

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,319
of the most prolific contributors to

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,559
drupal this is

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,720
robert douglas one of the most prolific

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,160
evangelizers of drupal

00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,240
my triple life changed because i had

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,000
breakfast with robert one morning

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,680
and i was complaining about something i

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,559
was saying well why does this thing work

00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,240
this way and not this other way he goes

00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,079
well you can fix that you know

00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,760
essentially

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,839
that that breakfast discussion turned

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,160
into a google summer of code

00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:56,640
project which turned into the feeds

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,640
module

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,799
yeah yeah

00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,200
here's here's how much credit i can take

00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,760
for the feeds module

00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,960
how come the aggregator module doesn't

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,960
have extensive bill hooks

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,040
that's where feeds module came from

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,640
right

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,559
so asking those kind of questions i

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,880
think is huge and i want to encourage

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,640
you to do it and i'll be available

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,559
up until i have to go catch a plane this

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,920
afternoon if you have questions like

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,680
that so i want to thank you for your

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,119
time and your patience i do know we're a

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,400
little bit over

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,000
yeah we're a little bit over so we don't

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,520
have time for questions but i'll be out

00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,119
in the hallway

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:41,839
and if you need to contact me this is

00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:41,839
all my information thank you again

00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,960
and i really do appreciate

00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,520
clown stacks are everywhere this is the

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,839
way to better utilize

00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,359
uh all your resources and it makes

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,960
managing all your resources pretty easy

00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:05,599
all of the innovation is happening in

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,599
open source

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,040
the collaborative nature and of the

00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,880
you know of the community and and the

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,720
speed at which these uh

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,400
these you know these these deficiencies

00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,200
these bugs are getting discovered and

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,920
then fixed

00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,400
is a thing that really shows the power

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,280
of the

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,799
you know of the open source community it

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,640
is global and it's definitely because of

00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:30,240
the users

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:33,920
community people are extremely friendly

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,920
and always ready to help

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,720
if you go on entire rc any day you'll

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,359
see these guys helping each other out

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,799
and

00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,599
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,599
manner the product is transparent for

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,680
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,000
base

00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,200
everyone can see how cloud stack is is

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,599
being built nothing

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,920
nothing is proprietary everything is

00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,920
open

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:04,000
in many ways it's absolutely vital to

00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:07,440
the to the ongoing health cloud stack

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,880
the most exciting event uh in recent

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,920
memory for me

00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,559
was our first developer boot camp

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,359
and our call gave people i think maybe

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,480
two weeks

00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,960
notice to come attend i was expecting 25

00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,000
or

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:26,559
30 people so we ended up with

00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,799
87 people and had to go get more chairs

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,920
into the room twice everything within

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,440
cloud computing

00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,760
is commodity and is open source and so i

00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,880
i don't think that you will uh you'll

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,960
see anywhere where

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,000
open source is not pervasive in cloud

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,640
computing

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,160
and so i i think it's uh i think it's an

00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,599
assumption i think

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,040
when you talk about cloud computing

00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,760
you're really talking about open source

00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,760
cloud computing

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,960
cloud stack is a robust solution for

00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,040
large deployments

00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,359
you have dozens of data centers and

00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,319
thousands of servers in each data center

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,599
is

01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:06,640
these hardware is going to fail and

01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:09,760
cloud stack is designed to handle

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,839
number one that mass scale number two

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,839
it's designed to handle the failure that

01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:16,400
inevitably happens

01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:19,280
in large deployments we started working

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:22,640
on cloud stack over four years ago

01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,400
and you know it was the original set of

01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,400
people working on it

01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,760
had a background of delivering software

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,559
to telcos and service providers

01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,400
lots of qa lots of users actually using

01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:38,079
it

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,960
high availability is a key feature

01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,160
multiple hypervisor support different

01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,520
network models

01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,480
you can pick up whatever suits you

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,319
better cloud stack management server can

01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,720
be deployed in different physical

01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,720
machines

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,000
it definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:58,480
being deployed everywhere

01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,720
there's a major movie studio that

01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,920
they were using cloud stack they were

01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,720
using it to

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,079
transcode video and i thought that was

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,680
terribly fascinating

01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,200
what i found more fascinating is what

01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,000
they did during lunch

01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,720
where they would spin up uh you know 50

01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,559
or 60

01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,760
game servers then as soon as lunch was

01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,559
over they would destroy all the

01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,359
instances and

01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,599
go back to doing real work cloud stack

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,079
is

01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,839
vast it touches so many different

01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,480
aspects and there's no one person that's

01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,480
kind of like

01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,839
a master of all those realms i think

01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,119
cloud stack

01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:33,359
as a project is going to be

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,240
one of the leaders simply because it's

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,160
some of the most

01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:41,599
featureful and and and robust

01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,599
platforms out there

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:53,839
i don't see any limits of the class tag

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,200
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,200
ago we could not have imagined

01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,319
that asterisk would not only become the

01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,079
most widely adopted

01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,920
open source communication software on

01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,760
the planet but that it would

01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,200
impact the entire industry in the way

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,720
that it has today

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,039
asterisk has found its way into more

01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,720
than 170 countries and virtually every

01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,880
fortune 1000 company

01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,160
the success of asterisks has enabled a

01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,520
transition of power

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,839
from the hands of the traditional

01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,440
proprietary phone vendors into the hands

01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,799
of the users and the administrators of

01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,640
phone systems

01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,160
using this power our customers have

01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,119
created all sorts of business changing

01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,720
applications

01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,400
from small office phone systems to

01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,480
mission critical call centers

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,319
to international carrier networks in

01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,920
fact there's even an entire country

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,240
whose communications infrastructure runs

01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,400
on asterisks digium has always been

01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,319
about creating technology that expands

01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,920
communications capabilities in ways we

01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:57,280
could never have imagined

01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,079
and that's part of what's game changing

01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,160
about digium today we're doing it again

01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,440
this time by introducing a new family of

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,359
hdip phones

01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,559
that extends control of the user all the

01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,000
way to the desktop

01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,839
the launch of these new products

01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,200
represents the next phase in digium's

01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,359
history of innovation

01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,119
these are the first and only iphones

01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,640
designed to fully leverage the power of

01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,160
asterisks when we first discussed our

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,839
expectations for building a family of

01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,000
phones for use with asterisk

01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,760
our requirements were pretty simple we

01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,119
asked the team to build the phones such

01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,359
that they were easy to install

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,400
integrate provision and use i think

01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,760
you'll soon agree

01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,319
our engineers have delivered on that

01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,839
goal user feedback is validating

01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,319
that when it comes to operation with

01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,319
astro space systems including our own

01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,599
switchvox based product these are the

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,520
easiest to use

01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,200
best integrated most interoperable

01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,799
products on the market today

01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,280
the digium family of phones will

01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,960
initially include three ip desk phones

01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,359
uniquely designed to complement any

01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,720
asterisk or switchvox based solution

01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:55,359
these phones are different for a number

01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,920
of reasons first they're exclusively

01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,240
designed

01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,160
for use with asterisks secondly we've

01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,680
made it really easy to auto discover and

01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,520
provision the phones

01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,119
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,839
to access information inside of

01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,440
asterisks

01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:09,440
allowing tight coupling between an

01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,039
application and the phone

01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,200
additionally we've created an

01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,079
applications engine that allows users

01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,400
and developers

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,280
to create and run their own apps on the

01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,680
phone

01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,200
and finally we've done all of this at a

01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,200
very compelling price point

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,200
at digium we're always thinking of ways

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,640
to give our customers the best value in

01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,640
business phone systems

01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,680
and also give them the power to create

01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,839
their own solutions

01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,280
for any communications challenge we'll

01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,880
continue to push the boundaries

01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,160
not only to make asterisks cooler and

01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,039
faster and more technologically

01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,880
feature-rich

01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,160
but to make asterisk voip communications

01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,680
even easier

01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:55,839
and together we'll change the way the

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:55,839
world communicates again

01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,359
