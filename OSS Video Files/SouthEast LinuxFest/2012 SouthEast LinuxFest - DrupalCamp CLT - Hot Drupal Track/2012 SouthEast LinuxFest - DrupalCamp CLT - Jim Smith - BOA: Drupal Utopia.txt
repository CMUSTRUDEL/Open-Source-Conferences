00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,490
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,380
possible all right I'll start over my

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,040
name is Jim Smith and I run a website

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,040
for a TV station in Knoxville wate the

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,680
website wapt.com is not a Drupal site it

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,300
is actually a site that was built in a

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,360
closed proprietary system that's the

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,030
corporate overlords hired this company

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,680
to provide that service and it's fine

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,300
you know at least when you have a

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,780
problem you pick up the call the phone

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,570
and call them and they fix it but the

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,000
downside is that it's you know the kind

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,850
of system where I don't have any access

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,920
to the database and in fact a few years

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,960
until a few years ago I didn't even have

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,930
access to be able to change a CSS file

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,880
they had to do all that so a number of

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,880
years ago I started looking around for a

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,689
way that I could do pages on the site

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,659
that we're not in that system but still

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,700
look like those the site so that I could

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,400
do the things that I wanted to do like a

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,100
display a really big weather image or

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,280
create a fancy contest entry form or

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,439
things that their system would not let

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,350
me do so I started looking around at

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,970
different CMS's all open source because

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,299
I didn't have any money to buy something

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,770
and Drupal was one of the ones that I

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,780
looked at and I didn't really much care

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,000
for it because it was hard to install

00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:01,399
and it was just a little too arcane for

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,930
what I was trying to do and I but I

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,060
eventually went back to it and by the

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,149
time I went back to it it had gone from

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,080
version 4.5 diversion 4.6 and suddenly

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,420
it was easier to install and

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,190
then Along Came 4.7 and they started

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,060
introduced things like flexi nodes which

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,940
are now known as CC CC k and so I

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,240
realized I'm kind of dating myself but

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,370
that really can't led me to be able to

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,470
not only do things like the pages that I

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:35,240
couldn't do on that site but also let me

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:38,360
do things that are totally well like one

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:45,040
off sites or do client sites and and so

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:47,510
then I so I really kind of developed my

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,790
interest in Drupal as you see I've been

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,730
to a lot of the camps and and spoken in

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,070
a few of them and and more recently I

00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,050
started my own freelance company and I

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:02,570
do sites and I also do training and so

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,170
today I'm happy to say this is the last

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:09,560
of my sessions for the week it's not

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,690
just I did one earlier today but I did

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,030
three earlier this week that were two to

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,300
three hours on length for a client so

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:21,530
I'm kind of done with talking for a

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:24,260
while so but we're going to talk today

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:29,030
about what sometimes referred to as boa

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:32,239
and no it is not bank of america what

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:39,110
we're talking about is Barracuda octopus

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:41,630
and Egger so some of you are probably

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,690
are familiar with agric in fact if you

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,880
were in Zach's discussion earlier there

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,420
was or there was another presentation

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,930
also about Edgar I believe or no that

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:59,239
was about Jenkins Zach talked quite a

00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:03,080
bit in depth about acre in the case of

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:09,040
this what Omega HCC has done is taken

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:13,250
the idea of egger and kind of made it

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:20,239
not only more robust but easier to

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:24,800
install on any server so it's still at

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,889
its heart an acre system and Egger if

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,919
you didn't get a chance

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,800
to hear Zack talk about it or if you

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,979
aren't real familiar with it it's a it's

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,389
a front end hosting solution it manages

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:44,580
and hosts sites and it does it in a way

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:48,240
that is very orderly and organized and

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:53,099
and very safe for managing your sites it

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:57,599
allows you to do things like update

00:04:53,099 --> 00:05:01,080
asite very safely because you you follow

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:07,860
a certain set of steps to do that that

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:11,550
and then when when you push the updates

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,860
if eager at anywhere along the line sees

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:17,189
any problem with that setup it will roll

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,819
back to the previous version so you

00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,919
really don't you know if you follow the

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,339
procedures right you really don't run

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:32,669
much risk of messing up your site so

00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:36,810
what the be part of boa Barracuda does

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:40,500
is it takes eager and it sets it up on a

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,050
specific server configuration it uses

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,389
engine X which is replacement for Apache

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:51,199
it uses a fast version of PHP and that

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,819
uses Maria DB if you were in Eric webs

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,069
presentation this morning you may have

00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,009
heard him discuss all of the three of

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,990
those a little bit he mentioned them and

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,620
he mentioned them in terms of this is

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:08,449
where people are going when they start

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,279
to want to think about performance and

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:16,800
Barracuda takes care of all that for you

00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:19,289
it went it installs on your server I

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,159
should back up and say one thing about

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,740
all this I'm talking when I talk about

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:27,659
these things as if I know about them I

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,789
don't really know that much about them

00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:32,490
I'm not a sensitive system administrator

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,769
I don't try to pretend to be one all I

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,490
am is a guy who needs to run science

00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,689
build sites I've got clients that don't

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,080
always necessarily

00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:46,379
want to go out for hosting because then

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,719
they kind of have to maintain some of

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,249
that control so I host their sites and I

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,379
charge them a little bit of a fee to

00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:54,689
kind of maintain them as well as host

00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,599
them so for me to be able to do that I

00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:00,779
need something that I can manage and be

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:07,139
safe and secure about and I also need to

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:10,019
be low-cost and so I i have been using

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,659
this system both at at my TV station job

00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,389
and in my freelance job to be able to

00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,399
manage these sides and do it at a very

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:24,629
low cost because we're talking about

00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:27,569
just buying like a VPS which is a fairly

00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:29,789
inexpensive way of getting into what

00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:34,639
would other be like you know you're

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:39,059
running your own server or whatever so

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:45,239
what what octopus then does on top of

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:49,409
Barracuda is it creates new instances or

00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:52,229
satellite instances of agar and again

00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:54,959
this is done just with a bash script all

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:59,189
of this that Barracuda and octopus do is

00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:02,879
done by just running the script but the

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:07,759
other thing that octopus does is it

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,739
allows you to real easily make use of

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,110
distributions of Drupal so it's not just

00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:15,809
your basic Drupal it's any pretty much

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,059
any of the distributions that are out

00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:22,610
there that's I've just listed a few but

00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:26,069
I can i can see open blog being on there

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:28,139
sometime soon but if you decided that

00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:32,189
you wanted to run open blog and it was

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:35,039
not part of octopus at this point it

00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:38,129
would still be possible to run that you

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,740
can run any Drupal site on on a server

00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:47,750
that's running this setup so

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:50,990
the there's lots of extras and lots of

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,089
unique things that are added in in terms

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,620
of this this setup and a few surprises

00:08:53,089 --> 00:09:01,600
along the way as well so it's plus it

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,430
gives you some real direction as to 22

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,589
how to set it up so that's that's the

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,279
advantage that I see about this it's

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:13,640
it's really easy to set up and you know

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,870
and I mean it's it's a great deal you

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,670
know how can you pass up a deal like

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:23,029
that so here's here's step by step out

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:28,990
basically how to set up the VPS witch or

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:33,410
a dedicated server that to run the agar

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,029
set up with barracuda and octopus first

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,040
it's important to know that not just any

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,540
VPS will work there are some out there

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:46,550
that are running what what's called

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:48,560
virtuoso or open the VZ that are that

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,450
they do a few things with the swap files

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,560
is what i understand again i'm talking

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,720
like hi I'm assistant and I'm not but so

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,570
you want to make sure that it's a Zen

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,980
vserver linux kvm or VMware based VPS if

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,810
that's what you're setting up otherwise

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,950
if you're setting up on a dedicated

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,290
server you don't want any kind of

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:15,410
operating system other than your just

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,730
your base level operating system and

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,079
that the three that are recommended are

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,570
debian squeeze which is the latest

00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:27,079
version of debian and then the last

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,390
couple of versions of you bunt too and

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,300
I've run it on both you bun to end

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,740
debian and i really don't can't say that

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,260
there is any difference in either one of

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:40,730
those so it's it's you know if you're

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,829
selecting a VPS maybe they only offer

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,690
certain ones and I don't it doesn't

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:48,980
really matter whether it's 32-bit or

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,420
64-bit that I can tell the one other

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,530
requirement is that you have to be able

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,900
to have

00:10:51,530 --> 00:11:01,530
get available access to get through port

00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:05,190
94 18 that that's geeky stuff to me all

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:08,610
I know is that the the company that I

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,380
use that's no problem and there's an

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,930
obvious with any of these you know

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:18,090
setups you have a base level of RAM that

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:20,340
probably is very minimal I mean that

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,380
that that would be very base you'd

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,260
probably want more than that especially

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:29,760
if you're running some sites that have a

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:35,670
little bit more like lots of pages being

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,590
delivered or then it Solar is is some an

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,250
option if you want that the solar search

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:45,090
set up it you can set that up very

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,730
easily with this setup but with with

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,810
barracuda but you will need a much

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:56,870
greater amount of RAM for that the other

00:11:51,810 --> 00:12:00,510
thing that the the requirements for

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:05,970
Barracuda our list as they're listed on

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:07,650
the documentation it says basic system

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,820
and skills and experience are required

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:15,840
and you know to me I'm almost saying

00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:20,010
just screw it and the reason why I say

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,900
that is because you know I've made this

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,030
point over and over i'm not assisted min

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,630
and i'm doing it and the way i was able

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,210
to do all this is just make mistakes and

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:35,610
start over if you're if you're willing

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:37,470
to do that if you're willing to just you

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,600
know as long as you haven't put life

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,450
sights on your set up until you're

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,370
absolutely sure that it's running the

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,710
way it should be and that you've set it

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,830
up the way you're comfortable and

00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:54,750
putting live sites on just set it up try

00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:59,340
it the it's very low cost to get a VPS

00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,750
up and running at these this kind of a

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:05,250
configuration

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,790
and set it up if it doesn't seem like it

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:13,050
was set up right the first time just the

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:15,840
with a VPS is basically one button to to

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,310
kill that set up and and set up a set it

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,620
up again it doesn't take very long to

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,250
run the scripts and all that to set up

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:29,730
these up either so once you've got

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:34,950
you've bought your your VPS you go login

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:38,040
to the the management back in and you

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,630
set up the domain of your server you

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:47,580
want to make sure that you've got the

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:50,430
host record set up to to handle

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,770
essentially if you have the asterisk

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:58,260
then that can handle any sub domains of

00:13:52,770 --> 00:14:04,140
your domain then you have to go into

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:08,400
your domain register company's site and

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,080
tell them to find your site at your host

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,700
company and that's justice you know

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,160
you've probably done that with any site

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:18,230
that you've built so it's nothing no

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:22,530
different than what you've done there

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:26,250
then just test it to make sure that your

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:33,330
you can that the internet can see your

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:37,680
server ping or host will hit the server

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:40,710
and if it bounces back that that that

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,540
the domain matches the location of the

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:47,550
server then you're you're good then you

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,750
have to configure the server the first

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,440
thing you're going to want to do is

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,500
login as root that's the login that

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,570
you're given when you're set up so just

00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,930
log in and you want to first set up the

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,170
hostname for that that's just a couple

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:09,630
of lines of code to be able to do that

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:11,730
and then zach has laid out some

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,050
information that I have to give him

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:20,550
credit for in terms of setting up the

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:24,959
openssh so that you that it it's just a

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:27,959
level of security that means that your I

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,790
mean the system itself is very secure

00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,400
and I'll get into that a little bit more

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,070
but this gives you that one extra level

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,420
of security is especially when it comes

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,530
to something so important here's your

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:44,850
route as you're using a public/private

00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:48,209
key and and to be able to log in you

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,850
have to have that key set up not only on

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,940
the server but on your ear set up from

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,839
where you're logging in so then there's

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,580
one other aspect of that that zach has

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:03,990
recommended in his post this blog post

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,790
and that is that you you set it up so

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:09,390
that you can only log in through this

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,490
using this public key and there's the

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,610
information that you need to use for

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,630
that by the way I've already published

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:21,420
posted this presentation on the

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,700
drupalcamp Charlotte listing for this

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,209
session so if you want any of this you

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:30,600
don't have to write it down then just

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:33,450
restart SSH and login again using your

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,060
public Keef if you log in you're good to

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,060
go if at some point you can't login you

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,880
lost you didn't get the setup right you

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,700
probably have to arista rebuild the

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,170
server but that would be you know again

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,750
just one of those mistakes that if you

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,930
make it it's it's just a little bit of

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,430
pain and setting it up again and you

00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,990
haven't done any installation of

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,060
anything yet at this point so it's

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,420
you're not talking about a lot of time

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,400
so next step for is just read the

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,699
documentation and there is a lot of it

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:09,240
if you go to the project page drupal.org

00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:11,189
/ project / Barracuda you pretty much

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,150
get out all the information that you

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,880
need right there there's a there's a

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:21,089
installed text file there's a readme.txt

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,790
file there is a hints text file there's

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,100
lots of stuff so seriously just read

00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:29,029
this stuff

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:32,309
they're there against the project page

00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:34,350
the next step is to download and run the

00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:37,320
Barracuda script now again you're logged

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,409
in as root and so all you have to do is

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:46,649
go to the root directory which you would

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:49,409
have if you logged in that way run one

00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:51,679
line of code to download it then which

00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:55,710
is a bash script and run the bash script

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,409
and this this is a step that changed

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,120
recently I had to I gave the same

00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,460
presentation in Nashville at the

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,220
drupalcamp there about a month and a

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,740
half ago and I had to redo the whole

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,970
presentation because some of this stuff

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,919
changed including that so that one bit

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:19,649
that one line of code just basically

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:23,309
just sets up the the batch bash script

00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:25,799
to be ready to handle being able to run

00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:27,840
octopus and barracuda it used to be that

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:32,220
you'd run Barracuda first and then

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,779
octopus and let me back up one second

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,409
because I'm not sure how well I explain

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:40,679
this Barracuda is an eager instance and

00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,450
so is octopus octopus is treated as a

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,730
satellite instance but they're all

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,519
running basically on your same server

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,730
although I guess conceivably you could

00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,169
run them on different servers but with

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,059
the way barracuda and octopus work

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:58,320
together I don't I don't know how you

00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:02,759
would do that but and I know that you

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,000
can with other sets setups with a with

00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:10,649
bit with egger so conceivably as I said

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,570
that's possible so with this with this

00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:21,179
one line to run the script you're

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:25,080
telling the the Barracuda octopus egger

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:26,690
set up to run the in this case the in

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,220
stable version there which was

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:34,399
essentially the same as the the current

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,920
released version as opposed to the head

00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:41,570
your setup

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:44,660
on public as opposed to a local host

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:50,870
you're running it on this domain and

00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:56,660
your email address and there if you want

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:59,480
to you can add to that a additional name

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:03,740
there to set up your first instance of

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:08,990
octopus the all that information is in

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:12,850
the install txt file so just follow the

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:16,400
directions and you'll be fine if you

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:19,700
when when you run that script what it's

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,340
doing is it's running everything that is

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,530
needed for Edgar it's it downloads all

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,160
the files needed for that and it's

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:30,830
setting up all that on either Maria DB

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,140
or percona server i think the database

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,600
server i think the default is maria DB

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:39,140
if you wanted to switch to percona you

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:45,320
can do that just by adding a switch in

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:47,990
your your script file the engine next

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,120
web server again is is tuned for

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,890
delivering a little bit just faster a

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,720
little bit more it's also kind of set up

00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:01,130
to handle some of the other caching

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,790
schemes a little bit better the fast PHP

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:07,460
is there and you can eat two versions of

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,470
that so yeah you definitely want the 5.3

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:14,270
if you're going to get into Drupal 7

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:17,450
things like that the all the extras for

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,920
fine tuning including well and now we

00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,170
start to get into a lot of the stuff

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,120
that Eric talked about this morning the

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:30,740
reddest cache server the new relic that

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,740
these are things that are already set up

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,230
for you automatically when the server

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:40,720
gets set up with egger you don't have to

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:43,270
do a thing and it's all right there the

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,320
server is set up to do automatically

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:51,480
automatically run

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,789
database backups it then has a few

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,289
little extras on top of that if you want

00:21:53,789 --> 00:22:00,630
them like Apache Solr it will even run

00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:02,700
your DNS for you as opposed to using

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,259
another service for running the DNS and

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,149
there's two ways that you can do that

00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:08,759
these are these are kind of experimental

00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:12,630
and I've never got into those but

00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:16,470
they're there if you want to do them as

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:19,169
an option you can run webmin which is a

00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:22,340
it's if you've ever used cpanel or

00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:25,500
another way of getting access to a

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:29,100
server through a user interface webmin

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,110
is an open-source version of that there

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,039
is a firewall what you do I think you

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:38,129
definitely would want for security

00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:41,519
there's a chive is the database manager

00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:43,169
which is very much like PHP my admin if

00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,860
you've ever used that tribe is very much

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:48,809
like it there's also SQL buddy as

00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,700
another database manager so those are

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:54,480
options you can select from if you want

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,009
and then you have a server monitor as

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,299
well if you want to just kind of see

00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:03,000
some graphical displays of how your

00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:06,750
server is performing and then the other

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,370
thing that it's part of octopus is that

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,870
every time you set up an instance of

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:20,360
octopus it's setting up a shell accounts

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:23,100
for that instance that give you the or

00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,690
if you want to like you have a client

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,870
that you want to give the client access

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:35,220
to some of this it gives them access to

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:38,159
the server through SF ft SFTP or EFTPS

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:45,419
which are more secure ways of getting in

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:52,019
rather than just FTP and they they allow

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:54,800
you to like if you wanted to upload

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,530
files or if you wanted to

00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,180
run DRA Shore sir you know certain

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:04,820
things that you you you can do that but

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:08,390
the number of commands that are allowed

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:12,110
within these accounts is very limited

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:15,170
there's very narrow scope of the

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:19,520
commands that are accessible and there's

00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:21,440
only the narrow area of the survey that

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,360
they have access to they don't have

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,850
permission to monkeying around with

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,790
stuff that doesn't directly affect that

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:33,250
the sites that are on that part of the

00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:36,650
server and they don't have any way of

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,690
monkeying with permissions and other

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,070
things that an administrator would want

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:44,810
to do if you want to add an additional

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,720
instance of octopus which you don't have

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,280
to do but if you wanted to it's just a

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,510
matter of running this the script again

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,240
but adding a new name for the the new

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,000
instance and that what I do and I think

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,080
to me this makes sense I don't know if

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,980
it makes would make sense to everybody

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,450
but to me I do run multiple instances of

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,550
octopus because what I'm doing is I'm

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm looking at it as this is my kind of

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:17,060
like isolated area for that site or you

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,730
know maybe it's actually more than one

00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,520
site or maybe it's like a test version

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:28,910
and a production version of the same

00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:33,230
site but I the way I look at it is that

00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:35,390
I am giving myself some parameters I'm

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,700
making sure that as I log in or whatever

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,700
that I'm not running a risk of messing

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:44,750
up files on another server and if I ever

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,760
mess it up and have to blow it up I'm

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,980
just blowing up that one instance and

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,040
not messing with all the other Suns

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,990
sites that are there so to me that's

00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,780
just one extra level of protection and

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,670
if I ever set it up so that I don't

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:03,200
currently have any clients that that

00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:06,740
would want to get into the this the site

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,750
from the back end to that level from the

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,030
server standpoint

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,700
but if I did I would be able to give

00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:16,220
them keys that would just let them into

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,570
that part of it and not I wouldn't have

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,530
any worried that they were getting into

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:25,460
another part that they could mess up so

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:29,360
when you anytime you run a script to

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:31,370
create a new octopus instance you get an

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,500
email and this may look familiar because

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,480
it is just like any other email you

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,700
would get when you create a Drupal site

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,350
remember all this is just Drupal it's

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,290
just Drupal set up in a different way

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,090
and that email gives you the log

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,000
information but the other thing that

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,520
that email gives you is information that

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,590
you really need to read just like the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,990
documentation there is information in

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,290
this meal that this email that you want

00:26:53,990 --> 00:27:00,230
to make sure that you follow

00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:03,740
specifically it gives you the the

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,810
information to login to the server that

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,260
I that limited shell that I was just

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:11,900
talking about all that's in the email so

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:15,260
don't lose that email or I mean you can

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:19,460
you you can change the password but you

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:24,230
want to make sure that that and in the

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:27,290
password will expire in 90 days if you

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,150
don't change it so you there's a these

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,940
all these extra levels of security that

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,490
if you're not a real sysadmin you would

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:39,530
never think of or never know about but

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:43,460
it does that for you so when you create

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:46,280
an instance of of octopus like I said

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,470
it's just a satellite instance of agar

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,600
and it looks just like a gir if you've

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,120
ever used dagger before if you've ever

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,550
seen a demo of agar there's nothing

00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:01,940
different about it there's it it's just

00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:05,600
egger and it allows you to set up

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:09,760
platforms which are essentially an

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,280
installation of Drupal that is perhaps

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,890
configured with a certain set of modules

00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:19,190
to run a certain type of site you think

00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,720
of it it also like and install profile

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:30,290
where it's got a collection of

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:34,140
of modules that for that site so when I

00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:39,870
when I'm going to update let's say

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:45,990
Drupal 12 the seven point 12 it gets

00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:48,390
updated to 7.4 teen what i would do is

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:52,500
create a new platform that has all the

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:55,950
same modules that the other month

00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:00,770
platform had but it has the version 7.1

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:06,450
for set up the platform then i'll run a

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:09,870
test of the first I'll clone my site run

00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,330
a test of it of migrating it to the new

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,130
platform everything checks out then I

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:19,080
can do the same thing by migrating my

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:24,750
live site to this new platform and I'm

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:28,200
safely doing the updating that way these

00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:32,220
are you know this is one site that's on

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:38,760
this and you can see that you have the

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:40,920
ability to clone and backup and all the

00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,330
things that egger does again I'm not

00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:47,820
really trying to give you a

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:51,720
demonstration of egger more just to show

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:55,890
you that that that this setup is a full

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:59,880
egger setup but i will give you a few

00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:02,480
tips on using it one is that you want to

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,520
make sure that you verify your platform

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,900
before you do any anything to it and

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,060
essentially just verify verify verify

00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,340
before you do anything verify if you're

00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,840
going to make a clone of it verify

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,070
before you make the clone that way

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,440
you're making sure that you're not

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:22,020
copying over a mistake what verify does

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,940
is it actually goes through and I don't

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,570
understand all all of what it does but

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:31,590
i'm sure that zach can't explain it but

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:33,280
it I mean it tests make sure that all

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:50,860
the paths are right doesn't it

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:52,390
it yeah so so that way when you make a

00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:57,130
copy of it or whatever you're you're

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:59,590
you're sure that it's it everything all

00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:04,920
the linkage of all the files and

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:08,920
everything is all going to be valid so

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,390
another tip to know is that then this is

00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,920
something that octopus does that I

00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:16,120
didn't know when I first started up

00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:21,430
because I didn't read is if you include

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:23,620
dev in the subdomain of your site then

00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:27,870
what it does is it turns off some of the

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:32,140
extra caching that's going on that that

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:35,020
has been set up as part of this system

00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,550
and you know I made a big deal about all

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:41,620
this caching well that's great when

00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:44,170
you're pushing out live content on a

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:48,820
site but it's not so great when you're

00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:56,440
trying to develop or test out and I i

00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:58,750
will say that sites that are on Edgar

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,320
are not necessarily the best place to be

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:05,230
developing you're probably better off

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,990
developing on a local system and then

00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,330
pushing to a test environment and then

00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,680
put a test site and then pushing to a

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:19,210
live site but if you if you if you are

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,880
doing some development make sure that

00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,370
your you've got dev in the sub domain

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,110
and that way you won't have problems

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,640
with caching because otherwise they'll

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,950
be frustrating I know I made these

00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,120
changes I'm even clearing cache and that

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:37,240
kind of stuff and I'm still not seeing

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:42,910
the changes it's because of that too to

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:46,110
create a new platform or when you when

00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,110
you when you want to

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,900
what I'm trying to say is when you want

00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:58,090
to update a site as I spoke of earlier

00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,790
you're creating a new platform and then

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:03,550
you're migrating to it a lot of people

00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:07,390
really like brush up because it does all

00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:08,980
that stuff automatically but it's not

00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,680
really the Aegir way even though egger

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:17,200
is using drum and to do all this stuff

00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:20,080
the reason is that um that they say

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,180
that's not the Aegir ways because drush

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,310
up is kind of like you're doing things

00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,020
blindly you're saying go for it now

00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,480
there is a certain amount of backing up

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:32,440
and stuff that drush will do as well but

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,040
this is that that belt and suspenders

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,680
kind of approach to serving up your

00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:43,110
sites and and and making changes to them

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:50,520
so it's it's very safe and secure to to

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:50,520
manage these sites I now that I see

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:57,040
doing it this way I realized some of the

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:00,310
the foolish things that I did in the

00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,980
past about just oh I'll just update this

00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:08,919
live site and boom cross my fingers that

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:11,260
nothing changed to create a new platform

00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:14,440
is actually pretty easy if you use a

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,760
dress make file there are a couple of

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,550
different ways in which you can create a

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,240
platform but the way that i found that

00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:29,290
works best is to use a make file and I

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:31,150
what I do is I for the most part my

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:38,530
drush make file doesn't declare a

00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:42,040
specific version of a module there are

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,500
some cases where maybe I might but that

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,970
way I'm always whenever I'm creating a

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,910
new platform I'm getting the latest

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,590
version and Anna but I'm always making a

00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,290
test and I'm always checking out my site

00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:55,000
very thoroughly before I do anything so

00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:00,760
that if I discover a problem along the

00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,160
way then because a module maybe is you

00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,730
know throwing a something hinky into the

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:12,760
whole thing you know I can fix that but

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:14,950
this way I'm I I don't have to go

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,660
through line by line and my drush make

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,330
file every time I want to make one of

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,040
these and you know I don't know if

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:25,050
that's the best way of doing it but it's

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,050
a way that so far has worked fine for me

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:32,590
to move a site that's on another server

00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,810
to octopus is not that difficult the

00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,840
instructions are there's like about six

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:40,060
or seven or eight steps to do that at 08

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:45,880
steps there it says right there in eight

00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:49,290
easy steps and essentially what it is is

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,460
your some of the steps are just

00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,910
something simple as making sure that

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:59,190
your permissions for for the files in

00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:05,680
your files directory are set right and

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:08,740
then you you copy over the files and I

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,620
use our sink for that I know don't

00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,780
remember if these directions say to use

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:17,680
our sink I think they might but our sink

00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:22,420
is a handy little command to copy files

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:24,040
over and then then you make sure that

00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:30,870
all the permissions are set up then you

00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:35,350
you create your platform and then you

00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:39,760
you install the site with the database

00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:44,650
and then actually what they tell you to

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,690
do is to make a clone of that to a

00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,190
different like a different sub domain or

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,500
something like that and then clone it

00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:55,060
back and the process of that is and

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,400
verifying along the way of course then

00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,760
that gets all the paths of all the files

00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,390
and everything sorted out and pointed in

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,960
the right direction so it you know I've

00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:10,630
moved several sites to my

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,599
setups and I've never run into a problem

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:17,530
doing it the way that they call foreign

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,210
that those directions I made this point

00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:22,270
earlier you don't have to have more than

00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:25,119
one octopus instance but i think it's

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:29,790
it's it's a it's a like i said to keep a

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,790
way of keeping a wall between your sides

00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,560
so one of the things i mentioned in my

00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,630
description of this session was that you

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,910
can even set up your own localhost

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:43,420
version and when i did when i wrote the

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:50,640
original idea up what I had in mind was

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:56,560
this project that was being developed to

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:59,859
create a virtual barracuda octopus egger

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:04,540
setup and they were proved they're

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:07,660
providing for download a virtualbox

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,520
image now VirtualBox if you've ever

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,550
dealt with virtualbox and virtualbox

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,930
images they can be they can be very big

00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:20,619
file so we're talking like about a

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:24,040
gigabyte file the what when I when I ran

00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,270
this and and tested it it worked I had

00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,570
to monkey with a little bit though

00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:34,510
because when i logged in I didn't get

00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:37,030
the graphical login to the server so and

00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,630
it's kind of hard to you know launch a

00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:45,730
web page if you don't have a graphical

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:50,500
view of the of the server so so I had to

00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:58,230
do some changes in some settings and I

00:38:50,500 --> 00:39:02,020
think I even had to upload a few

00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:04,180
packages in order to be able to make

00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:10,150
that work but I was able to get it to

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:12,250
work but as I said about him three or

00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,220
four weeks ago after I did the Nashville

00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,950
session they they made some changes in

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:21,220
the system so now putting it on a local

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,530
host is really easy they give these

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,760
directions right here in the install txt

00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:30,130
file all you have to do is essentially

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,200
is replaced the word public which

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:36,490
remember was in that string of text that

00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:45,520
was to run the script you just change

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:51,700
that to to local all everything else in

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:56,950
that that string of commands is the same

00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:59,680
and it will set it up on your own server

00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:02,680
it will set up the everything exactly

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,470
the same way although presumably it

00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,359
probably doesn't need the firewall since

00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,050
it's on your own machine and you've

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:15,550
already got a firewall on your machine

00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:17,800
so I actually had some success with this

00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:21,099
although it I ended up having a problem

00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,250
with some of my setup I was trying to do

00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:25,930
this kind of as I said I had all these

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,690
presentations to do this week and so I

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,510
was kind of in a rush to try this and I

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:34,990
ran into some problems with virtualbox

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:42,960
that has to do not with this setup but

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:46,270
has to do with my my connections my

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,339
network interface with virtualbox so I

00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,200
was having some internet problems it was

00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:51,970
it was weird that I could do some stuff

00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,369
from the command line but I couldn't get

00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,320
web pages to come up on the browser and

00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,450
stuff it's just I need to dig in that's

00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,820
more but anyway what you will need to do

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:07,450
if you want to try this is to go to like

00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:13,330
go to the Debian site and get a get an

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:15,930
ISO of the an image of the this the

00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:20,619
server what you don't want the this I

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:22,000
should say an image of debbie and you

00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,720
don't want the server version you just

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,240
want an image of just plain vanilla

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:32,890
debian because as we pointed out earlier

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:39,790
Barracuda takes care of all the other

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:44,800
stuff related to the server so anyway as

00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:47,950
I said I ran it I I got to a certain

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,430
point and then it hiccup Taz it was

00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:55,060
trying to connect to drupal.org to

00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:57,610
download Drupal and so but what I did

00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,100
like was it they throw in these little

00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:04,570
cute little things into their commands

00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:06,550
like boa Skynet welcomes you and then

00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:09,130
there's another when it's all done it

00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:12,250
makes a reference to thank you and your

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:15,150
credit card has been charged and and of

00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:20,590
course it's free but it's a little joke

00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:25,090
so I if we when we have a little bit of

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:27,910
time I can I could go do a little bit of

00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:32,380
a demo with agar if you wanted to and

00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:33,520
set up but I thought maybe you had some

00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,310
questions so that probably be more

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,620
valuable to you then seeing something

00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,620
maybe you've already seen any questions

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:52,720
you're stunned you're tired ready to go

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:55,090
home all right well um i really don't

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,560
anything else so we can call it a day

00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,560
and i thank you very much

00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:13,260
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,420
way to better utilize all your resources

00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,870
and it makes managing all your resources

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:22,700
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:26,220
happening in open source the

00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,020
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,940
of the community and the speed at which

00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,130
these are these you know these

00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,440
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,050
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,750
that really shows the power of the you

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,370
know of the open source community it is

00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:45,570
global and it's definitely because of

00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:51,900
the users community people are extremely

00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:53,670
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,100
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,210
these guys helping each other out and

00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,120
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,950
manner the product is transparent for

00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:06,150
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:08,190
base everyone can see how close duck is

00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:14,040
is being built nothing nothing is

00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:16,680
proprietary everything is open in many

00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:20,880
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:24,660
unborn health CloudStack the most

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:28,470
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:31,200
was our first developer boot camp

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,869
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,830
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:42,060
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:44,820
with 87 people and had to go get board

00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,369
chairs into the room twice everything

00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:50,609
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:53,670
is open source and so I don't think that

00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:55,440
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,470
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,020
computing and so i think it's i think

00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,520
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,660
about cloud computing you're really

00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:09,210
talking about open source cloud

00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:12,240
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,369
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,630
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:21,330
in each data center is these hardware is

00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:24,810
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:27,510
to handle number one that mass scale

00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:30,690
number two it's designed to handle the

00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,940
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:36,780
deployments we started working on

00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:40,109
contact over four years ago and it was

00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,359
the original set of people working on it

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:45,470
I had a background of delivering

00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:49,020
software telcos and service providers

00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:53,750
lots of QA lots of users actually using

00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:57,359
it high availability is a key feature

00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:59,490
multiple hypervisors support different

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,280
network models you can pick up whatever

00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:04,349
suits you better while step management

00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,070
server can be deployed in different

00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:09,660
physical machines it definitely has a

00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,270
huge footprint it's being deployed

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:17,099
everywhere there's a major movie studio

00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:20,670
that they were using cloudstack they

00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:22,200
were using it to transcode video and i

00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,180
thought that was terribly fascinating

00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,250
what i found more fascinating is what

00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,970
they did during lunch where they would

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,440
spin up you know 50 or 60 game servers

00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,660
then as soon as lunch was over they

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,930
would destroy all the instance

00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:38,480
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:40,250
vast it touches so many different

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,109
aspects and there's no one person that's

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,770
kind of like a master of all those

00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:48,650
realms I think cloudstack as a project

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,930
is going to be one of the leaders simply

00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:56,030
because it's some of the most feature

00:46:50,930 --> 00:47:00,140
fallen and and robust platforms out they

00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:02,650
were I don't senior living through the

00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,650
clouds dag

00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,270
you

00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,290
you

00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,290
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,510
ago we could not have imagined that

00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,730
asterisk would not only become the most

00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,860
widely adopted open source communication

00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,900
software on the planet but that it would

00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,420
impact the entire industry in the way

00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,400
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,040
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,990
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,090
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,470
transition of power from the hands of

00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:19,750
the traditional proprietary phone

00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,150
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,100
administrators of phone systems using

00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,330
this power our customers have created

00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,250
all sorts of business changing

00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,110
applications from small office phone

00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,630
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,220
the international carrier networks in

00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,020
fact there's even an entire country

00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,420
those communications infrastructure runs

00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,550
on esters the gym has always been about

00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,260
creating technology that expands

00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,420
communications capabilities in ways that

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,620
we could never have imagined and that's

00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,020
part of what's game-changing about

00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,720
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,790
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,920
IP phones that extends control of the

00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:55,660
user all the way to the desktop the

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,370
launch of these new products represents

00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,380
the next phase indigenous history of

00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,870
innovation these are the first and only

00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,250
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,900
power of esther's when we first

00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,550
discussed our expectations for building

00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,160
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:10,960
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,700
asked the team to build the phones such

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,920
that they were easy to install integrate

00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,750
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,300
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,950
that goal user feedback is validating

00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,050
that when it comes to operation with

00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,480
astro space systems including our own

00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,060
Switchvox based product these are the

00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,350
easiest to use best integrated most

00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,960
interoperable products on the market

00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,930
today the Digium family of phones will

00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,010
initially include three IP des hommes

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,830
uniquely designed to complement any

00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,820
asterisk or switch box base solution

00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:42,490
these phones are different for a number

00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:45,130
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,570
designed for use with esters secondly

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,180
we've made it really easy to

00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,560
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,660
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,220
to access information inside of asterisk

00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,220
allowing tight coupling

00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,180
between an application and the phone

00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,340
additionally we've created an

00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:02,470
applications engine that allows users

00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:05,050
and developers to create and run their

00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:07,119
own apps on the following and finally

00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,190
we've done all of this at a very

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,869
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,640
always thinking of ways to give our

00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:15,040
customers the best value in business

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,900
phone systems and also give them the

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,060
power to create their own solutions or

00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,950
any communications challenge will

00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,599
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,670
to make Astra's cooler faster and more

00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:26,290
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,780
asterisk and what communications even

00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:32,460
easier and together we'll change the way

00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,460
