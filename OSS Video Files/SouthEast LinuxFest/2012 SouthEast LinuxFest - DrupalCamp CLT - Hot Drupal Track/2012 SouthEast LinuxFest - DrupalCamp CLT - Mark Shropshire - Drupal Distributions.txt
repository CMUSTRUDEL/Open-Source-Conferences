thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,880

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,730
possible alright guys I guess we'll go

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,529
ahead and get started um kind of stay on

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,489
track so that other folks can do their

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,489
thing coming up so my name is Mark

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,149
Shropshire and I'm here represent thanks

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,489
got some fan clubs here and here

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,930
representing char Doug and I want talk

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,739
about creating and deploying Drupal

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,570
distributions and so this is something I

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,250
kind of dig on doing quite a bit and

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,510
thinking through this and learning all

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,030
the time because there's always new ways

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,510
to accomplish it and there's a lot of

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,250
moving parts so I kind of want to jump

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,260
right into kind of a little bit about

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,260
distributions so folks aren't familiar

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,710
so so some components that are involved

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,380
in a distribution you at least for

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,470
Drupal is Drupal core so that's all the

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,200
files that make up what is Drupal when

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,700
you download it from dupont org and then

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,740
there's the supporting modules themes

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,590
and libraries so I want to talk in

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,530
modules contribs contribs libraries

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,670
could be external third party could be

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,820
CSS grids could be jquery UI anything

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,280
like that that it need to be pulled in

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,009
to make this site happen Drupal

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,479
installation profiles which have been

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,149
around for quite a while but if you've

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,340
used Drupal this is what basically lives

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,520
in the profiles folder out of the root

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,439
of Drupal and your install profile is

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,509
just our code that say hey this is how

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,030
to configure this Drupal site when you

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,680
do the Installer so you you're you're

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,270
running an installation profile any time

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,060
you install Drupal through the

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,500
instructions that are included with the

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,700
read means with Drupal and you download

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,110
it so that's kind of a traditional

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
wedding deploy and that is just manually

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,930
install

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,370
drupal nothing wrong with that it's

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,760
totally totally doable and and then the

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:28,140
last component is features and general

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,010
distribution modules and I kind of put

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,880
those together they're not the same

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,500
thing but but features is a module talk

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,360
about in just a minute and what I mean

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,010
by general distribution modules is a lot

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,420
of times you just need a what I call it

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,620
and others have called a glue module

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,100
some module that comes with a

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,390
distribution that just wraps up some

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,690
housekeeping and things that need to

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,160
happen maybe include update scripts to

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,280
run when new versions of the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,450
distribution are installed so that's

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,920
what I mean they're so just a regular

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,840
drupal module that just has a lot of

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
general purpose things that you make you

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,750
want to make sure that this when it

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:09,060
installs a user gets some of it could be

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:12,570
you know content or just configs so so

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,010
types of distributions and and I'll make

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,650
sure that you know my slides get out

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,870
there and put that out tweet that out on

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,340
the you know some of the drupalcamp

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,680
Charlotte you'll get it retweeted on

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,540
there but the reason I want to mention

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,280
that was I've got some reference URLs

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,200
here so you don't have to write those

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,060
Ellen if you want to or whatever but so

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,769
we'll have the slides out there so this

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,360
comes straight from some distribution

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,799
documentation on people or which is

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,090
actually better than it used to be a lot

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,110
better someone's put a lot of work into

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,250
it and so things are things are getting

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,489
better but the two types of

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,950
distributions that drew what I'd org

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,790
folks break break things down into is a

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,680
full-featured distribution this is you

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,480
know this could be you know how many

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,299
folks are you know know about open

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,130
atrium or familiar with up an atrium so

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,070
good number of folks so open atrium for

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,709
those that don't know is a is a Drupal 6

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,590
distribution that has in the package as

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,480
everything you need to basically kind of

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,220
do base camp kind of things in familiar

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,340
the base camp project management has

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,590
calendars and groups and his case

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,390
tracker so you can do support tickets or

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,260
track software development inside that's

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,370
you know open atrium is a great example

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,970
of a of a well you know flushed out

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,190
distribution

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,070
that that tries to do everything and get

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,660
they get updates and there where I know

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,600
folks are working on a Drupal 7 version

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,160
so kind of pumped about that but there

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,540
there are a lot of distributions out

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,710
there they're full-featured distros

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,970
there's many examples but but I did want

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,880
to mention to the if you go to drupal

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,010
org you can go to what used to be called

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,780
installation profiles for downloads if

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,520
they've rebranded this as distributions

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,020
so if you've got a Drupada door gunner

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,850
downloaded extend you can download you

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,830
can go through and check out a lot of

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,950
distributions that folks have uploaded

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,760
and shared shared there and you can some

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,110
of the things we're going to go through

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,310
demo today we'll show you how you

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,110
actually pull this down and use them and

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,680
play with them and it's a great way to

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,700
kind of try new systems out even if you

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,020
just want to look at the code at how

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,570
they set something up or configured it

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,010
and then kind of kind of borrow it for

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,290
your own needs it's a great way to kind

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:24,840
of learn about things and then there's

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:26,880
other distributions is so let's say that

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,450
a lot of design shops a lot of drupal

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,040
shops do this but let's say that you you

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,710
know you commonly build sites and you

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,510
start out with you know 25 modules and

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,800
you always use those modules and maybe

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,450
there's some configurations that you

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,580
always use on every Drupal site there's

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,460
you know whatever it is that you always

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,169
want to get to you know it's not fun if

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,790
you're doing a lot of web work and every

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,430
time you're having to pull those down

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,470
manually unzip on put them in place put

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,300
them on a server do the clickety

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,400
clickety through the UI and configure

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,229
everything what what this does for you

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,060
is this allows you to say i'm building

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,380
the distro that's that's not really i

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,280
mean you could give it to somebody but

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,960
they probably don't have they probably

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,390
want to tailor it for themselves but

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,040
it's for you and your shop maybe or you

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,260
know your company or just for you to

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,580
easily get up and running and have

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,080
things configured so you can quickly

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,520
start working on a website that's what

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,590
we want to do for clients clients want

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,169
to see stuff pretty quick and you know

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,660
you can kind of get started at least by

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:24,120
just running these these quick starts

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,919
for developers I'll say developers and

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,440
site builders because I think I think

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,020
that's important I think we can continue

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,950
to make distributions easier to install

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,450
we're going to have a really good chance

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,340
at having people that maybe aren't

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,330
developers but site builders leverage

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,550
that

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,419
and be able to get to get down to

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,729
business so some of that some of the

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,759
tools to kind of make this stuff happen

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,069
and this is this is not a comprehensive

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,460
list but I've got a few slides here with

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,710
various tools that I use so you guys may

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,810
have others and can bring those up

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,250
that'd be awesome but and these tools

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,099
also do other things I don't want to

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,120
first don't want to misconstrue that you

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,530
know these tools are just for dis

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,210
regions they actually are powerful and

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,889
do many many other things so the first

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,240
one that's that I think anybody that

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,199
does dribble development has grown to

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,319
love is drush and drush make you know

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,639
with the latest version Drudge 5 drush

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,039
make which used to be a separate project

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,319
has been included which this makes it

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,469
easier to always have those tools

00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,090
available talk about a little bit more

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:32,400
about what drush make does in a little

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:36,180
bit but there's some links for the dress

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,650
project and George WS as the

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,719
documentation which is a great site to

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,159
reference but you can you can get the

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:42,779
documentation through command line too

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:45,509
so but if you want to look at on the web

00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,430
it's a good place and in their part of

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,430
drush comes with a I did want to mention

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,860
this there's a Drudge tool called make

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,139
generate and I haven't used this in a

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,129
while but so I'm hoping it works i'm

00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,979
going to standing up here and saying go

00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:01,409
tries okay so it's actually is it with

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,330
open blog saw it and I don't know if you

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:06,750
know Zach's awesome so just one of the

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,069
child help to Zach but up and but so

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,289
make generate what that does you could

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,669
have an existing Drupal site and you can

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,250
run drush make generate and it's going

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,400
to basically create a make file that has

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,680
all the modules and contributing pieces

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,199
that you need to distribute that exact

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,150
same setup to another site which the

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,979
make files are a piece of what you know

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:32,430
what is a distribution profiler profiler

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,890
is a is an optional module that you can

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,599
use to help build distributions I kind

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,820
of go back and forth with it I like it

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,469
sometimes sometimes I don't want to use

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,180
it but what profiler does is it lets you

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,300
it basically lets you do things in a

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,410
distribution through make syntax so if I

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,120
want to

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,879
matically have users configured roles

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,370
configured maybe a home page content

00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:58,199
item now node one that set up it

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,420
basically allows you to have that baked

00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:06,029
in without having to code that with just

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,170
raw PHP in other hooks and things so you

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,980
don't have to use it it's worth checking

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,470
out and it's it's pretty well documented

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,360
out there but but it's it's definitely a

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,069
neat tool don't I don't want to make it

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,139
seem as if it's a requirement something

00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:20,730
I lie to you sometimes sub install

00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,709
profiles that something profiler can do

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,769
but actually that lets you have kind of

00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:27,300
a main profile that maybe has certain

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,670
configurations for maybe what you use a

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,930
lot but then you can have sub profiles

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,389
that maybe can add additional

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,310
functionality in during the build of the

00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:38,279
files process pull in other modules and

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,490
themes and things I don't really use sub

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,139
profiles too much but maybe in the near

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,040
future on some projects I've got going

00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:50,459
there's a link to that guy too so so

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,079
features I'm just going to it you know

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,579
that this is this is a little out of

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,649
order and at all to matthew cottan

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,689
before we started it would been really

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:01,170
cool to maybe do my session and then

00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:04,139
kick off into features but if you missed

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,180
Matthews Matthews in the back yet with

00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:09,060
the cap there but if you miss if you

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,819
miss missed his his session on features

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,380
he's got some other previous sessions

00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:15,540
google in this video his video will be

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,860
online at some point so people watch out

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:22,290
for that but features is is basically

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,939
wrapping up configuration and converting

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,750
configuration that you normally click

00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:29,339
around the UI and convert it to code so

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,980
that that code can be easily deployed

00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,230
and distributions love that to be able

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,819
to quickly deploy just code again you're

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,529
trying to avoid clicking and configuring

00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:39,959
and adding content types manually and

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,970
adding views manually and doing all that

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,880
you want to do that once configure it

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,829
and then wrap that up in a feature

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,209
matthew does that sound pretty pretty

00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:51,120
close all right he's giving me a thumbs

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:53,129
up so check out matthews information on

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,449
that and and there's the link for

00:10:53,129 --> 00:11:00,540
features um i'm not going to get into

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:03,270
packaging drupal.org distributions there

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,680
is a process for that which

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,180
of us are learning I'm learning a little

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,610
bit about it zacks aren't quite a bit

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,920
about it but I'm not gonna get into that

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,360
I did want to mention though when you

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,160
properly set up a distribution and put

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,200
it on drupal.org and host it there which

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,790
i think is a great place to host it of

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,550
course as drupal related and keep it in

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,320
the community there's there's some

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,870
documentation here and include that's

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,240
that node 6 for 21 16 that's the node

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,950
that has that documentation check that

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,380
out there's some additional tools that

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,380
you'll need drupal.org drush which

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,050
you'll add to your drush configurations

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,940
in the usually in the your home

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,710
directory drush folder you'll drop that

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,540
in there just check it out from yet but

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,840
that gives you some additional commands

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,430
to make sure that your make files are

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,570
proper and set up the way that your

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,410
blood work expect them to because Drupal

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,290
had ordered us some additional things

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,430
with distros it'll not only does it

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,320
allow you just to download and run the

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,200
distro locally but it'll actually you

00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,970
know zip up that is a package so we can

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,980
just downloaded all the files if they

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,750
don't want to use make I think that's

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,570
still true that is so once you do a

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,370
release an actual drupal.org release it

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,690
will wrap up and you can somebody can

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,250
easily download this again this is may

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,570
be good for site builders that don't

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,670
want to get into system administration's

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,410
out of it they can still use it use this

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,250
and just download those files and

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,140
install it like they would a normal

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,420
drupal site manually which is nothing

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,040
wrong with that if they want to quickly

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,830
get that rolling so the distribution

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,930
files and this is not necessarily a

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,490
complete list but this is the lot of

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,890
files that you're going to want to

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:38,580
probably use to get going some of them

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:44,240
are optional so so we'll talk through

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:49,050
some of these I've got let's hear so I

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,520
think yeah okay so I didn't think I

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,660
broke these out as separate things but

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,890
I'm actually going to open some of these

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,980
files up and show you some code here in

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,790
a second but if you go to the node

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,750
reference at the bottom of this slide

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,740
there's some detail on what some of

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,540
these files are but I'm gonna kind of

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,490
tell you what these are generally so in

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,490
starting a Drupal 7 the dot info file

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,050
has some basically it's a text file with

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,180
configuration that lets you declare

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,930
dependencies for modules that need to be

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,380
enabled by default that you may

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,450
the distribution and this is actually

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,290
the dot info is part of a drupal install

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,520
profile so it doesn't have to be just it

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,710
doesn't have to be you don't do it just

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,540
for the full distribution but if you're

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,610
just doing an install profile by itself

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,350
you still need an info file but it

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,910
basically like a module info file

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,790
declares all the information Drupal

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,990
needs to recognize it as a sort of

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,510
moduli call it sort of module because a

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,310
lot of it pieces of a profile work just

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,040
like a module it's just a little bit

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,360
different so the info file declares a

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,450
lot of information you need to get it

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,920
going the profile file that profile is

00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,680
it actually runs with a fully

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,480
bootstrapped version of Drupal so the

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,390
most hooks and anything you can use in a

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,410
module can be used in that dot profile

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:12,029
so you can place code right in there to

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:17,380
execute and configure different pieces

00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:20,440
the the dot install and this this file I

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:24,730
believe I believe this one might be

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,770
optional but it basically allows you to

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,279
you could add content and other

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:32,680
configurations that are not install

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,930
you'll notice if you you know a good way

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,850
to learn about the install profile piece

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,640
of a distro is just to go to a Drupal

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,510
download Drupal 7 go to the profiles

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,470
folder look at the standard and minimal

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,910
profiles that are in a profiler and just

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,770
kind of look at the code I mean that

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,300
codes been vetted I think that's a great

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,440
place to start been vetted by the

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,390
community and it's a good place start to

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:57,760
learn about how they've accomplished

00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:59,110
these pieces as a community and so just

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,390
want to throw that out there now that

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,700
kind of covers the install profile piece

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,500
of it just you know and so you could use

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,410
those three files make a profile drop it

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,760
in an existing Drupal site install it I

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,070
mean not an existing group assaults been

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
installed but a code base and when you

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,149
do the install you would it you would be

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,709
able to execute you know the contents of

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:22,180
those three files but that doesn't

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,800
completely make a distribution um you

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,829
know another component for distribution

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,170
is is how do I get the files in place

00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,670
how do I get that

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,730
all those files download all that

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,130
contributed I've been around Drupal

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,459
since probably 4.5 and I remember

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,839
downloading you know the zip files and

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,940
unzip and I'm and dropping it in place

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,760
and manual ins you know secure ftp into

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,470
the server and and you know sometimes

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,010
you that's still handy to use those

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,560
techniques but but a make file actually

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,199
in for a dressmaker file actually give

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,820
is a text file that has all the pieces

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,350
you need to put together your

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,380
distribution so that could be modules

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,660
themes libraries again talk about a

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,430
jQuery are what that does that says when

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,829
I runs rush make pull all those pieces

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,910
down to the filesystem and give me all

00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:13,920
the files I need to make it happen the

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,760
the last piece of a lot of folks jeans

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,170
that build distributions is a stub file

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,290
this is a shortened make file that

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,970
basically has declares which version of

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,889
Drupal core you want to pull in so you

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,470
could pull in Drupal 7 you can pull in

00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:30,600
that versions of 7 you could pull and

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,790
press flow you could you know this this

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,339
little short stub file it just lets just

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,760
declares the core and it says I went

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,769
after you pull down core go grab go grab

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,500
the full installation profile the full

00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,720
distro and what happens is drush mate

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,920
goes and checks out all of these files

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,320
are listed here that are part of that

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,339
distribution and looks for the next make

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,600
file and starts building off of that and

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,350
so that that's kind of handy and some of

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,899
the instructions on all the

00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,190
distributions actually you know say

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,560
here's how to make your stub file to

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,089
pull everything down so that's

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,069
definitely hanging so those are some of

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,640
the pieces but I want to want to show

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,000
you some of this um let's see here

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,000


00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,350
I'm going to go to

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,060
ok

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
I'm actually going to show you some of

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:51,429
the contents of some of these files and

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:53,350
just give you a feel so this is a we'll

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:56,290
talk about this omit this is a project

00:17:53,350 --> 00:18:00,760
that is actually started is called open

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,080
blog and this is just a check out I get

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,240
check out and I wanted to show you some

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,130
of the files so we talked about the info

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,130
file this is this is what it looks like

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,990
you basically have the name of the

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,309
project you've got a description and

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,809
you've got your core designation and

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,900
then we basically have from there all

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:26,460
the dependencies that this these are

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:29,350
modules that the distro relies on and so

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,270
if you've if you've already pulled down

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,290
through your make file maybe a new

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,150
module you want to include with the

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,460
distribution and you want that thing to

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,320
be enabled by default once the once it

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,390
installs so you don't have to go the

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,280
modules page and do that you can just

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,559
add any dependencies line equals in the

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:52,150
name of the module so it's kind of its

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:57,460
kind of super handy and she here so yeah

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:59,169
let's jump to the jump to the to the

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,309
make fun with this this is some of these

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,450
files are named a little different

00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,280
because that's part of how Drupal

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:11,020
packages it how you have to package it

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:12,850
for Drupal but so so this is the yeah

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,260
this is this is basic Zach saying this

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,150
is you know in the drupal.org

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,910
distribution setup this is the stub file

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,280
that tells you you know include this

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,020
make file so let's just saying include

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,940
that file that's the version of corey

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:29,620
want and go ahead and grab this version

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,919
of open blog so it's pulling the dev

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:36,880
version checking out with get let me

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,080
grab this and move it over and it's the

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,520
clinic that's declaring the URL to

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,320
download it the branch you can specify

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,490
the branch this is drush make stuff so

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,910
this is all documented interred rush

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,080
mate nothing crazy here and the type you

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,790
want to tell it it's a profile so it

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,419
knows that that's hey we're going to

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,419
build off of this

00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:57,190
what's that so right oh this is what you

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,970
know what I was looking for you knew

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,920
right away this is this is what you i

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,920
would consider just you know if you

00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,780
weren't doing a full drupal org

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,310
distribution this this could be just

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,410
your soul mate file in the in the

00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,540
package if you if you didn't have a stub

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,160
so this this declares this is where

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,530
we're actually declaring the modules to

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,080
download and the version numbers that we

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,820
want to pull in and i will say this i

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,590
think with anybody that manages sites

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,970
with deployment systems whether it's

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,190
their own deployment systems are eager

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,210
or other tools declaring version number

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,340
is real important because you're

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,600
guaranteeing that this build works the

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,400
way you expect it and test it because

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,050
we've had issues where I know as I can

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,970
I've had issues with some some modules

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,980
that had a recent update and then things

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,570
broke and we were able to point back and

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,970
say now just use this one for now until

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:45,070
those issues are resolved so that's

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,560
really handy to declare version numbers

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,880
um and I'm scroll through so here's

00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,680
where you can declare themes their

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,500
projects I've drupal.org so you they

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,430
work the same way as a module but

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,720
because drush is aware that this is

00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,220
these are themes it's going to know to

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,480
place it automatically in the themes

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,250
folder and by the way I didn't mention

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,840
this all these files when you pull down

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,210
it when you run drush make and will see

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,280
is all these files go into your profiles

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,960
folder so they'll be if you don't

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,750
declare destinations there will be

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,590
you'll see a modules folder a themes

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:20,530
folder you could if it's not automatic

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,510
we use we like to generally put

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,360
libraries in the libraries folder so

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,740
that you kind of have an organization

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,230
and it's not just one folder with a

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,660
bunch of projects listed that's kind of

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,670
handy and here's an example of libraries

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:39,010
at the bottom where we're pulling in an

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:41,080
1140 CSS grid and I think I think we had

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,790
to use the library's API module to

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,800
actually tell it to drop it in the

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,680
libraries folder and to be aware to look

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:52,510
in profiles libraries for the for that

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:56,410
location so so other files this is the

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:59,940
this is the dot profile and so that this

00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:02,370
this this file is pretty simple and and

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,730
while we're doing here is a

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:08,670
a uniform altar to grab the site name

00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:12,900
and declare it I think it's just

00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:14,610
declared off the hostname other okay

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,559
it's wrapping yeah she's grabbing a

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,570
server name and saying hey make this the

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,860
site name once it installs from the

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,850
server name just a handy function i

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:25,410
think this code just came out of core

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,330
because we a lot of times we use it just

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,220
because it's it's handy to have but you

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,130
can add other hooks in here to do other

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:36,750
things so keep that in mind the dot

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:38,280
install file this is this is this is

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,890
great so this is where you can do things

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,809
like install your markdown filters and

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,240
allah this code 2 is out of court and

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:46,770
it's been tweaked you know exactly i'd

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,840
speak to it you know you can ask me but

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,220
I pretty sure he got code from some of

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,620
the core stuff implementations because

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,610
it's done right and and then he's done

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,890
his own thing because he's written

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,260
install profiles from scratch so he he

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,570
went in as made all kinds of changes but

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,550
um but he's added the video filter

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,890
because open blog uses the video filter

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,559
with some settings but these are these

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:13,500
are the input formats and we'll scroll

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:17,100
down and he's he's disabling bartok and

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,630
because when these other themes and just

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,640
various other so this is just a lot of

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,900
configuration type stuff setting content

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,309
types so again this is the open blog

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,470
project so if you get a drupal.org /

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:31,470
project / open blog there'll be a link

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,630
here in a minute to check that out you

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,070
can actually download that and kind of

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:41,660
look through the code and get a feel

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:41,660
another good example for that so

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,380
so you know talking on the deployment

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,230
side that's some of the pieces you need

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,200
to create distributions start starting

00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,520
on the deployment side of things there's

00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,630
always the manual install and there's

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,330
nothing wrong with this so you can

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,970
download again the files you can

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,370
download Jupiter core and put a profile

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:09,040
install profile right inside the

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,890
profiles folder and just run a standard

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,840
install but you know you don't want to

00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,370
overlook that a lot of us have

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,040
deployment scripts and other tools to

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,150
make things happen you know in an

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,060
automated fashion when you're doing with

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,290
lots of sites but you know this is this

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,730
is something that lots of people

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,080
download Drupal and just need to install

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,840
one side and they're just running one

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,570
blog or one you know company sought

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,010
corporate side or whatever so people

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,210
still need to be able to do that and so

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,040
you want to test that's another point

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,260
you want to test your distributions and

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,930
just all profiles against manual install

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,970
other tools that you can that you have

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,420
the ability to test with like a ger and

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,890
other things like that so so another

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,810
option is you can use to point your own

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,910
custom deployment scripts so this is

00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,740
probably more common than not you know

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,010
folks have deployment scripts that

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,000
they've written and they have a you know

00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,920
they have a lot of pride in to

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,280
deployment scripts and there they love

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,780
their deployment scripts the only this

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,340
is fun I think it's perfectly fine the

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,050
only issue I would say with that is your

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,000
custom deployment scripts have been

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,710
vetted by you and maybe a few other

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,590
people on your team so there are at

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,330
least other options to consider too

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,790
eager there are other options to

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:21,760
consider that that have code that's been

00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:25,060
vetted by many people and and that was

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,920
on a shameless plug but it was and so

00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,600
but there's nothing wrong with point

00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,040
scripts if it does what you want it also

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,990
needs out you know to work there for you

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:39,100
so that's totally cool so in it and then

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,620
obviously agar is another option so so

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,530
at this point I wanted to you know just

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,720
make mention that zach has a a group

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,820
presentation coming up next and he's

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,190
going to be talking about some some fun

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,780
stuff with that so it's not just a gurtu

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,030
it's it's it's Jenkins and it's how to

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,770
manage it and continuous integration and

00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,300
a lot of things he's doing but there's a

00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,170
link to the community a group projects

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,300
worth checking out

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,100
um haven't used agar quite a bit it

00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,140
works for a lot of things it's not

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,490
perfect for everything but it's always

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,870
one of those tools in the tool bag that

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,490
you should evaluate and see is this is

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,730
this what we need it may not be what you

00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,900
need it's you know but it's great if you

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,850
have to kind of host your own little

00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,190
internal cloud yourself that kind of

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,560
thing and there are services there are

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,030
companies that do will do agar hosting

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,340
for you if you just want to do that but

00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,540
then again there's devcloud there's you

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,910
know Pantheon there's a lot of other

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,830
services out there that that that do

00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:36,130
this kind of thing for you and even more

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:38,860
so so so there's a little tool in drush

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,600
5 that's that's kind of neat so for a

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,010
while there's been rushed side install

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,290
which is a grave so this is kind of

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,120
local to you know testing and you always

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,910
want to test your distribution locally

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,430
so drush site install Lord Russia SI

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:54,100
allows you to declare you can declare

00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,410
username password your your database

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,440
connection string and when you run it it

00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,490
basically will it will execute once

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,810
you've done the dress make and

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,550
everything it will execute and run the

00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,440
profile from command line so you don't

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,960
have to go through the you know pick

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,670
your profile and enter the site username

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,920
password email address and all that

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,440
stuff you do it through command line and

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,330
then you can go and set up a V host

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,130
locally or however you do that for your

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:24,010
local environment and go and check out

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:28,060
the the site but rush 5 introduced drush

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:30,790
quick quick or drupal which is rush QD

00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,290
for short in this takes this is kind of

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:35,650
like they took a lot of the dress SI

00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:38,880
pieces and they added if you have ax you

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:44,530
know local access to a PHP cg I've

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,840
server or I believe in PHP 54 there's no

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,130
a web server built-in for local dev this

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,410
isn't production and stuff but it's

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,570
great for local testing and things what

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,210
this will do is this will actually go

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:59,320
get you know basically run your profile

00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:02,050
and then start up you know a local web

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,210
server on a port launch your default

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,950
browser and you will be logged into the

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,730
admin user of the site of the UID one

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,590
and it's it's pretty neat so a lot of

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,880
use cases testing distros are great i

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,590
think doing patch

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,740
matches for issue queue stuff is great

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,550
so you can quickly fire off a Drupal 7

00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,410
you know again you can make a little

00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,700
distro just in a stub file just for your

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,140
standard config and then test your

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:29,140
modules if you've got people committing

00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:31,840
patches to you so so anyway got the

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:36,220
little open blog logo and there's the

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,570
open blog link so check that out I had

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,160
to pick some discs try to do this off of

00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:47,320
an open blog is is a is one that I like

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,300
um so so right now I've got I'll be

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,980
honest with you I've got in i have an

00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,340
iphone connected to a macbook pro

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,630
tethering USB but i've got backups so

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,570
I'm just getting buddy heads up this

00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,950
will be interesting I'll just ctrl C out

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,430
if it doesn't work you know it takes too

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:14,820
long or whatever but what we've got here

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:18,550
is is a so we've got a stub file and

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,590
this is basically saying use it use

00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:26,350
Drupal not you know not press flow or

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:27,550
some other version of Drupal and you can

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,800
declare you can actually declare which

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,080
version to that you'd like but then it

00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,960
says hey kick off a profile go get open

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,900
blog and we're getting the development

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,030
branch of the seven development branch

00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,050
so we've got this this this thing now

00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,030
how do we get our code right now we

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,340
don't have our code download in their

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,960
mouth so my folder open blog dash files

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,910
that's got a lot of my backups in case

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:54,610
this doesn't work so what we're going to

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:57,670
do is we're going to drush make open

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:00,250
blogs so we're declaring which make file

00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:03,550
which stuff out at lunch and I'm going

00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,780
to do I'm going to make the destination

00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,660
folder is going to be open blog dash

00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,600
demo / Drupal there's a reason i'm going

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,780
to levels deep i want I want I want the

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,010
all the root of Drupal to live

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,390
underneath open blog demo it just makes

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,060
drush QT a little easier because drush

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,420
QT by default uses SQL Lite just as a

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,620
quick way to test things in place so one

00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,650
of those files will be contained in the

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,260
directory and we're going to run that

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,600
and this will be interesting see what

00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,680
happens here so we're downloading Drupal

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,580
core it's gonna start pulling down all

00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,920
the components that it needs at this

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:43,990
point is that folks have questions are

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:46,120
there things were questioning mostly

00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,530
related to this topic I don't mean

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,510
questioning just your life or any

00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,510
philosophical things well

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:07,280
you mean like just like using a full

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:11,270
profile versus just to make file by

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,250
itself kind of thing so so basically the

00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,660
two things you name the make files and

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,150
then the insulation profiles added

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,070
together makes a distribution so the

00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,690
make file is still beneficial like if

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,700
you if you're not doing any

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,380
configuration and you don't care about

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,390
that site luncheon with any configuring

00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,920
like that you can you can forget the

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,540
installation profile and you can just

00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,230
have your make file run that to get your

00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:35,720
code down just like we did here and

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,830
basically just say okay i'll click and

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,910
configure and set it up and there's

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,700
nothing wrong with that you can you know

00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:43,520
go and pick the minimal or standard

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:47,060
profile based in drupal 7 and go for it

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,500
but if you're wanting to do you know all

00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,370
the configurations add custom content

00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:55,610
types launch off you know have features

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,110
included as part of your distro things

00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:00,080
like that then you definitely want to

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:02,690
have that installed profile be a piece

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,010
of that and in and i don't wanna make it

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,480
sound like you have to have both or you

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,060
just have to do drush make you can also

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,340
just do an install profile just download

00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,170
in some other fashion Drupal core and

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,190
then drop that profile in there so it

00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,070
there's a lot of flexibility in his

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:20,680
world that wraps up in that is that does

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,680
that hell was that cool Robert did you

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,630
sure

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,350
oh I'm so glad you asked this because I

00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,670
forgot to put this in my slides so

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:40,250
there's there's several ways it has a

00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,720
great question because and I know open

00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,600
blog is already moving in that direction

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,060
is going to have upgrades from

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,740
conversations I've had with Zach but you

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,690
don't have to support any upgrades this

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,430
can be the one shot install for the dev

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,110
shop or the individual starting a new

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,850
site and you're not going to do upgrade

00:32:54,110 --> 00:33:00,110
so that's one option if you want to do

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:01,910
upgrades in the profile profile you so

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,550
one option is you could do a hook up

00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:08,360
date you know number so just like you

00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:11,150
would hook update your modules is the

00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,360
dot profile the right place you guys

00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,360
think

00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,700
you

00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:34,409
okay go

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,710
so definitely and so what Zacks doin

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:16,060
here what he say he's doing here is he's

00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,740
using in open blog ease he has a feature

00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,030
and he's got the dawn in style added to

00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,579
that feature and that's where he can put

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,079
hook update number functions in to

00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,960
update it which it would just be

00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,000
following if you search you know hooks

00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,220
to update Drupal modules it's the same

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,079
functionality and Robert I was incorrect

00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,550
her eyes thinking about it you wouldn't

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,079
if he if you're not doing it this way

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,619
don't put it in dot profile you'll just

00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,899
use the dot install in your in your this

00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:43,450
drove your or your installation profile

00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:46,750
and and you can put the updates in there

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,970
also but what this means for people that

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,710
use egger or even if you don't use egg

00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,210
or other tools that you can build new

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,879
platforms out and migrate to the new

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,470
version of that build and that's where

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,609
it is real powerful you don't need a

00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,640
girl to do that you can always just

00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:02,740
download a new version and just move the

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,470
database / manually in some fashion and

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,290
it's doing as anything angers doing or

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,599
your deploy scripts you know that do the

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,819
same thing so but that's important I

00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,770
mean you want to plan for updates you

00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,060
know that could have chose it's it's

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,200
it's open source you get a said yeah I'm

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,290
not supporting this is what you get out

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,579
of box i'll update it good luck you're

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,530
on your and maybe that's applicable in

00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:24,730
some areas because you know people are

00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,819
going to do their own thing from there

00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,650
and it doesn't you know they're they're

00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:32,230
going to vary so far from once they run

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,040
it initially that it updates are not a

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,210
huge deal but in this project it makes a

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,530
lot of sense because you're so you were

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,660
trying to get people with this project

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,250
it i think i can speak to some vision

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,050
here but you know and he'll talk more

00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,460
about it but trying to get trying to

00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,990
create some other ways and there's some

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,880
other projects going on too in this vein

00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:53,829
to make it easy for people just to roll

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,510
a blog sampling in a simple blog so

00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:58,089
we've got that we've got dress drush

00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,710
make has done its thing pull down pull

00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:03,460
down all the files that it needs and so

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:12,130
this is so now we have a open blog demo

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:13,810
directory and so what we're going to so

00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,569
there's there's droop on one level down

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:18,520
okay so this is just you know it's it's

00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,420
all it's done is pulled down Drupal core

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,460
whatever version specified I think seven

00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,400
for its specified explicitly right now

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:27,020
but but you know you can change that if

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,640
you needed to for some reason you can

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,540
also there's also ways by the way i'll

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,220
just throw sorry i'm not going to get

00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,080
into it right now there are ways to do

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,300
patching with drush make and with

00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,690
install profile so you can patch i won't

00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,580
say it core you can do that if you have

00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,370
to sometimes we have to do that for some

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,980
functionality is but it's not condoned

00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,820
I'm not condoning it it's best to stay

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,630
away from that unless you absolutely

00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:52,100
have to but what's what's probably more

00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,420
common is that you just need a special

00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,590
patch maybe there's an issue for a

00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,790
module that you really have to have in

00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,090
your distro and you need to patch that

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,230
drush make has a method for patching

00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,120
adding patches once it downloads the

00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,530
modules you need to really thoroughly

00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,720
test this stuff though because you know

00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,400
i'll just grab the you know the patch

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,050
that someone does this fixes my problems

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,470
because you know those things are vetted

00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,520
over time and issue queues so if we just

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,670
want to show this real quick if you go

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,640
to the profiles folder you'll notice we

00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,650
now not only have minimal standard and

00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,420
testing which is by default Drupal 7 we

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:28,370
have open blog which if you go into this

00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,930
this guy it's the same files that I had

00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,060
checked out another location on my file

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:39,830
system so just just to prove that this

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:41,420
thing actually works huh okay so changes

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,590
are happy this is its its communities

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,770
moving forward all the time changes

00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,720
happen I've got an old version but but

00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:50,830
that's part of the fun of it so and i

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,140
will say open blog is being actively

00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:55,580
changed and updated frequently it's a

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,390
great project diversion in blog sites

00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:02,030
and and so I definitely definitely want

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:04,880
to say hey any contributions and ideas

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:09,880
will be great but um so our next little

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,140
piece and I'm going to have to copy this

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:18,470
I'm going to copy this and we'll talk

00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:19,760
about what this does alright thank

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,440
goodness I do standing disk because this

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,880
is easy standing up here and doing this

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,990
now it's made it a lot of these used to

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,000
be um carbon copy clone um must be 12

00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:36,040
new

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,600
so so we're going to paste in ok so

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,980
again drush QD is a great little tool

00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:45,370
part of drudge 5 to quickly get a site

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,260
running configured and I've you don't

00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,610
have to do all these switches and things

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,080
i'll just quickly tell you what i'm

00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,420
doing here but it's a little self

00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,710
explanatory for some of it and we're

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,200
declaring that the profile we want to

00:38:53,710 --> 00:39:00,310
execute is open blog we're going to use

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,660
an existing core which means is already

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,590
downloaded on the system that they don't

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,940
have to go down it's that's part of

00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,680
drush cutie you also it'll go and

00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,350
download and fetch modules for you and

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,410
core so check that out it's really cool

00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:15,460
and I'm declaring the folder where the

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:18,490
root of the drupal install is I'm using

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,830
cash because I want an iphone that way

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,060
if since I've already downloaded this

00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:24,580
Wi-Fi somewhere else it's going to use

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,710
drush as cash to you know doesn't need

00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,750
to redownload 714 I encourage using cash

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,340
into and testing because somebody's

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,960
paying for this bandwidth and it's

00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,420
usually you know through drupal

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,270
association i think funds and things so

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,550
bandwidth costs so some big beak on

00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,550
there's a lot of a lot of ways like that

00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,260
to cash that stuff and just the dash y

00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,880
which is draw you know and rushes like a

00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,920
lot of command line tools just to skip

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,230
all the questions and answers we don't

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,970
need that and then watchdog is something

00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,620
i usually do with drush cutie what that

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,670
does is when we're done we're going to

00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,820
have a term that the terminal one is

00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,290
going to show you all the requests and

00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,420
and things that the web server is

00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,420
executing but it what this does it

00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:07,750
interject I'll watchdog Drupal watchdog

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,280
log filings right into in line with the

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,200
file server log so that's kind of cool

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,670
so let's run it let's just let's get

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,870
over come on stop stop talk and just run

00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:19,210
it this will take a little bit it's not

00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:21,460
a few seconds because the more

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,610
complicated the profile is the more cut

00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,830
execute and do but this is where the

00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:30,070
magic happens so we use the segue for

00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,280
any any questions at this point ty get

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,280
for it

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:48,740
that's that's a great question I really

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,040
don't know I my guess I'll tell you my

00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:54,170
guess my guess is is that it's less than

00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,400
a lot it could be more than others

00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:00,410
depending on the distribution obviously

00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,200
open atrium probably has more you know

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,910
the open blog or you know other things

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,840
that we're always cooking up for

00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:11,090
distributions but my butt big picture I

00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,040
would say overall average is probably

00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,510
less overall because this is that's why

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,609
I want to do a session on it and get

00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,160
more people using this stuff it is a

00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:21,020
little bit more getting into an

00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,670
intermediate advanced kind of stuff it's

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,810
getting its stretching developers of

00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,450
folks in a room there strictly

00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,950
developers in our essays it gets in an

00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,440
essay territory because there's

00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,540
dependencies on drush and tools and

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,430
things that have to happen so a lot of

00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,500
times these things in a group and a team

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,970
setting wound up being a a group effort

00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,220
you know you've got some ministers

00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:42,230
helping on the parts they need you've

00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,230
got developers you know testing and

00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,609
working on the distribution but that's

00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,359
my guess but I don't have any data on

00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:51,740
it's a good question I mean and

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,020
obviously on a project pages you can get

00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,070
in some idea but there's a bunch of

00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,010
distributions out there and some of them

00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,020
are really old so just like anything

00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:03,410
else you know download test it try but

00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,609
you know I like to sort projects a lot

00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,349
of times I'll do what I work but you

00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,599
know frequently updated or other methods

00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:09,920
just to see what people are using and

00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,580
what are what's relevant and what's

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,200
popular that kind of thing normally this

00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:20,859
doesn't run I've got a backup copy to

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:25,839
pull things were happening there we go

00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:25,839
and this was this was over iPhone yay

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:32,100
it does do that dress QD does that and

00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,690
you can specify Firefox you could say

00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,150
you know some it maybe hyphen hyphen

00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,340
browser equals Firefox or Chrome or so

00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,860
you can you can tweak that I think it

00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,480
just going to grab the default system

00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:46,000
and I've only tried this on OS 10 I hear

00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,100
that it's it works on linux from people

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,350
that have used on linux windows I don't

00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,820
have any idea about but I know the

00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,010
drudge team is really working hard to

00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:58,620
support more and more on Windows to give

00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,620
those tools to the windows developers so

00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,820
yeah I haven't looked at the code to see

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:11,680
how they're doing it but I but you're

00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,200
specifying just than just the common

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,820
name for it so what I've seen in demos

00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,370
as peoples literally just say firefox

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,350
all lowercase so I don't know if it's

00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:22,330
looking at a number of possible names

00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:26,710
there's I've not seen anybody's version

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:30,700
that's a good question but it might not

00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:33,520
in my best suggestion for that is go go

00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,740
check out the drug dig into the dress

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,180
code there'll be a command under drush

00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,460
when you download rush and rush mate

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,810
there's a commands folder and that one

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,330
of the commands has this stuff in it

00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,680
where it's going and figuring out that

00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:46,840
you know those parameters that you those

00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,420
arguments you'll bill to see exactly how

00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,740
they're doing it writing the code that's

00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,330
one thing that's awesome about open

00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:57,640
source and just just to prove this is a

00:43:52,330 --> 00:44:00,090
working site we can go to modules and we

00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,680
know it's working side it's working but

00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:04,950
let's look at some a lot of these

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,700
dependencies were declared in the

00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:12,700
profile but we've got google fonts api

00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:16,170
which is part of the font your face it's

00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,170
a pretty neat little thing i'll go ahead

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:53,270
yeah now profiler profiler it doesn't do

00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,830
every you know doesn't do everything

00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:57,110
because it has to be programmed to do

00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,190
what it does but it does a lot of common

00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:01,760
tasks so it will definitely help with

00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,960
that to do a full install profile and

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,250
whatever that means because an install

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,440
profile could be anything that's why

00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,180
there's got to be a file somewhere you

00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,090
just you're just throwing in hooks and

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:13,370
PHP code to do custom stuff but you know

00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:15,320
back in in drush five days I believe

00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:17,540
there was a module that would try to do

00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,670
build install profiles but I don't know

00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,880
how great that would be I never used it

00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,810
it may have been awesome I just don't

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,120
know how great it would be because it

00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,350
would it's a situation where whoever's

00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,490
writing that modules got to figure out

00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,770
every possible thing that they think

00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:35,210
somebody's going to want to do which is

00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:36,470
kind of crazy so so so but to help help

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,780
you along before you have to get into

00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,000
writing code as a site builder yes the

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:44,300
profiler module you'll include that as a

00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,010
library download and drush make and you

00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,730
need the documentation will tell you to

00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:51,290
grab some code which will basically run

00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:54,530
that function and you put it in your dot

00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:56,780
profile file of your it's just in euless

00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,940
copy paste put in your dot profile that

00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,690
includes the profiler functionality then

00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,890
because there's executing and it came

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,960
everything it does but I think you can

00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:09,590
do you like you can custom have menus

00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:12,830
out of box content default users some

00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:14,450
default roles it's it what it does is

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,860
you'll put all that in your dot profile

00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,320
steal but it just extends what dot

00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,790
profile does basically so so i would

00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,350
definitely check it out if you're coming

00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,900
from a site builder standpoint i mean i

00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,850
use it and I'm a developer but I

00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,860
sometimes it's nice to just you know

00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,930
enter configs and just make it cleaner

00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,880
and then but at some point you'll have

00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,250
to probably started venturing into the

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,390
world of writing some PHP to do certain

00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,580
things you want it's just it's going to

00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:40,580
happen but but you can always copy stuff

00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:42,750
from core and mimic some of the things

00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,410
that may be the standard install does

00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,410
I would

00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,410
distribution

00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:34,569
yeah I think and then you may be the

00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,180
perfect candidate for this talk I mean

00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:38,829
and that's to say here this is kind of I

00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,940
was looking for here are some tools it's

00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:42,190
gonna take more research than what we

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,989
can talk through in an hour but you know

00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,779
we've all that have done it have been

00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:48,729
through that you know certainly

00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:50,410
installing profile install profiles can

00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:53,019
be more advanced but don't let it don't

00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,400
let it scare you away there's a lot more

00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,969
tools and rings to me i mean i remember

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,200
back in the day when some some drupal

00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,359
shops that don't even exist anymore

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,619
we're really pushing the install profile

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,989
and made some of that happen in the core

00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:06,700
and you know they could see the future

00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:09,579
this is where this stuff is headed i

00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:12,789
think in a lot of ways but with profiler

00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:13,989
and rush make and things that that

00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,719
there's a lot of tools there to really

00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:18,849
get you a long ways and then you know so

00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,559
there will be some of that pain point to

00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:22,809
get i said pain point I'm sorry Scott

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,839
there'll be some a little bit pain to

00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:28,209
get through the next to that last phase

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,789
of probably mostly most of the stuff you

00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:33,519
put in the dot install file is the piece

00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:35,229
that I would say is where you're a lot

00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:39,660
of bulk of your code it is it Don style

00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:39,660
am I getting yeah

00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,760
I

00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:34,650
yeah totally um and but you know if you

00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,970
guys have other questions that's pretty

00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,180
much all I have we can keep talking

00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:42,050
distros and I I'll throw out something

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:44,100
that I always do this but I decided not

00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:46,980
to put this in the slide deck because I

00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,060
didn't want to make things even even

00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,260
more complicated but I will throw out

00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,210
something that's worth taking a look at

00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,280
I don't even know how i feel about this

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,290
I'm not weighing in yea or nay that this

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,070
is a great idea but there's a lot

00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:00,480
there's a large movement part of the

00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,740
contributed community creating

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,760
applications and there's a lot of

00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:09,570
application servers hitting out there

00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:11,070
what these let's take us will not talk

00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,320
about the part where you you charge for

00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:15,030
applications that's a whole nother

00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,980
philosophical thing and I'm not versed

00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,200
to get in that but the concept here is

00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,930
that you know when you run drush make

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,369
and or if you install a feature for

00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,170
instance a great example you saw a

00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:28,920
feature it you need to have those

00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:30,510
modules in place already so that makes

00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,010
features perfect for distributions

00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,990
install profiles because you've already

00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:38,609
run drush make you have your modules in

00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:40,680
place the the applications servers that

00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:44,070
you can run now and I came into the

00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:49,470
project at / project / applications or

00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:50,760
apps perhaps such apps is is let you run

00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,810
your you can have your own so kind of

00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,630
back in the day if you're familiar

00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:56,609
feature servers kind of akin to that but

00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,950
what would I know about those well I

00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:00,330
haven't run my own yet but what I've

00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:02,160
heard about those is that it will

00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,369
actually pull down the dependency so if

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,380
if you need you know module x y&z it'll

00:51:05,369 --> 00:51:08,930
go ahead and download those and then put

00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,480
them in place where things of being in

00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:14,010
addition to executing configuration code

00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:17,790
I'm not sure that that really fits in

00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:19,619
the distributions it it could i guess

00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,510
but i don't i don't see it where I see

00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:23,030
its places you have an existing Drupal

00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,410
site and you want to go ahead and add

00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,490
additional functionality easily to it

00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:30,540
and so there's some really neat things

00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:33,119
coming out like like movements on just

00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,170
again other vlog pieces and event

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,940
calendars and things like that if people

00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,520
just say click and install this

00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:41,970
additional functionality so

00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,850
I think that's Nate so that's all I have

00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:49,160
unless you guys have questions or

00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:49,160
whatever it's been real

00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:06,930
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:09,119
way to better utilize all your resources

00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:12,570
and it makes managing all your resources

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:16,400
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:19,920
happening in open source the

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,720
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,640
of the community and the speed at which

00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,800
these are these you know these

00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,010
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:31,079
discovered and then fixed is that really

00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,079
shows the power of the you know of the

00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:36,440
open source community it is global and

00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,960
it's definitely because of the users

00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:45,930
community people are extremely friendly

00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:47,670
and always ready to help if you go on

00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,800
tire see any day you'll see these guys

00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:52,500
helping each other out and they're all

00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,210
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,200
product is transparent for everyone

00:52:54,210 --> 00:53:00,390
everyone can look at the code base

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,630
everyone can see how close that is being

00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:08,130
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:10,770
everything is open in many ways it's

00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:15,210
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:19,410
health I'll stack the most exciting

00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:23,190
event in recent memory for me was our

00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:25,770
first developer boot camp and our call

00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:29,400
gave people a give me two weeks notice

00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:34,800
to come attend I was expecting 25 or 30

00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:37,319
people so we ended up with 87 people and

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,690
had to go get more chairs in the room

00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:43,410
twice everything within cloud computing

00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:46,140
is commodity and is open source and so I

00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:47,910
don't think that you will you'll see

00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,579
anywhere where open source is not

00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:53,460
pervasive in cloud computing and so i

00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:55,319
think it's i think it's an assumption i

00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,579
think when you talk about cloud

00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,960
computing you're really talking about

00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:59,960
open source cloud computing

00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:06,269
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

00:54:03,509 --> 00:54:08,669
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:12,689
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:54:08,669 --> 00:54:15,959
data centers these hardware is going to

00:54:12,689 --> 00:54:19,169
fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:21,659
handle number one that mass scale number

00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:24,389
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:27,209
that inevitably happens in large

00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:31,439
deployments started working on cod tech

00:54:27,209 --> 00:54:34,709
over four years ago and it was the

00:54:31,439 --> 00:54:36,479
original set of people working on it had

00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:40,589
a background of delivering software

00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:44,819
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:48,449
lots of users actually using it high

00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:51,509
availability is the key feature multiple

00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:53,549
hypervisors support different network

00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:56,219
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:58,469
you better while steck management server

00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:02,159
can be deployed in different physical

00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:03,809
machines it definitely has a huge

00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:08,819
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:11,399
there's a major movie studio that they

00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:14,699
were using CloudStack they were using it

00:55:11,399 --> 00:55:16,679
to transcode video and i thought that

00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:18,329
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:21,599
more fascinating is what they did during

00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:24,389
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,739
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:27,659
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:31,799
the instances and get back to doing real

00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:33,119
work CloudStack is vast it touches so

00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:35,219
many different aspects and there's no

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,589
one person that's kind of like a master

00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:41,699
of all those realms I think cloudstack

00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:43,919
as a project is going to be one of the

00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:45,780
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:51,770
most feature poland

00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:51,770
and and robust platforms out they were

00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,330
Adams senior living through the clouds

00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,330
tag

00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,160
you

00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,309
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,529
ago we could not have imagined that

00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:23,750
asterisk would not only become the most

00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:25,880
widely adopted open source communication

00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,920
software on the planet but that it would

00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,440
impact the entire industry in the way

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,420
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,059
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,010
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:39,079
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,490
transition of power from the hands of

00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:42,769
the traditional proprietary phone

00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:45,170
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:47,119
administrators of phone systems using

00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:48,349
this power our customers have created

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,269
all sorts of business changing

00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:52,130
applications from small office phone

00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:54,650
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,240
to international carrier networks in

00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:58,039
fact there's even an entire country

00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,650
those communications infrastructure runs

00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:02,569
on esters the gym has always been about

00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,279
creating technology that expands

00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:06,440
communications capabilities in ways that

00:57:04,279 --> 00:57:07,640
we could never have imagined and that's

00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,400
part of what's game-changing about

00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,740
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,809
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,940
IP phones that extends control of the

00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:18,680
user all the way to the desktop the

00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,420
launch of these new products represents

00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,490
the next phase indigenous history of

00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,920
innovation these are the first and only

00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:26,599
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,160
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,200
our expectations for building a family

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,359
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,099
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:35,720
the team to build the phones such that

00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:37,940
they were easy to install integrate

00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,769
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:42,349
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:43,970
that goal user feedback is validating

00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:46,069
that when it comes to operation with

00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:48,500
astro space systems including our own

00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:51,079
Switchvox based product these are the

00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,400
easiest to use best integrated most

00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:54,980
interoperable products on the market

00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,950
today the digitally phones will

00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,029
initially include three IP des hommes

00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,849
uniquely designed to complement any

00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:02,839
asterisk or switch box base solution

00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:05,509
these phones are different for a number

00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:08,150
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:09,589
designed for use with esters secondly

00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,200
we've made it really easy to

00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:13,579
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,680
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:17,250
to access information inside of asterisk

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,220
allowing tight coupling

00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,210
between an application and the phone

00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,370
additionally we've created an

00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:25,470
applications engineer that allows users

00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:28,080
and developers to create and run their

00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:30,150
own apps on the following and finally

00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,190
we've done all of this at a very

00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,900
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,670
always thinking of ways to give our

00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,040
customers the best value in business

00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,930
phone systems and also give them the

00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,090
power to create their own solutions or

00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,950
any communications challenge well

00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,660
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,700
to make astros cooler bastard more

00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,320
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,780
asterisk and what communications even

00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:55,190
easier and together we'll change the way

00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,190
