the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

linux fest visit WWF eastland TX phase

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,000
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,150
in 2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,650
possible I think we've got a great

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,179
lineup of talks and I'm hoping

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,059
everybody's going to really enjoy what's

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,960
going on but before we get started I

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,329
want to make sure to thank both self for

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,989
allowing us to take part in their event

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,629
so we're kind of a con inside of a con

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,910
and I also want to make sure that I

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,210
thank all of our sponsors because they

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,300
were all very generous and came through

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,050
in a big way to help us make this event

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,160
a reality here in Charlotte so I got a

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,719
slide deck that I'm going to put up

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,940
that's going to eventually that's going

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,890
to have everybody's you know that all

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,600
the sponsors websites and stuff like

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:13,640
that but console tech fire I Gotham

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,369
digital science impact media qualis

00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,159
rapid7 and wicked all came through in a

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,990
major way to help us out so a bunch of

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,729
those vendors are out some of those

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,280
vendors are outside and have tables so

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,329
please stop in pay them a visit at least

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,280
hear their spiel and I guess we'll go

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,729
ahead and get started again thanks

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,729
everybody for coming

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:16,220
hello hello good morning everybody thank

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,370
you for coming and the organizers of

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:22,190
besides Charlotte thank you for having

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:27,380
me it's an honor to be the first speaker

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,680
the first ever besides Charlotte so

00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,320
today we're going to talk about malware

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,280
automation so can you guys hear me at

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:42,260
the back sometimes I tend to speak very

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:45,860
softly before we begin let me introduce

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:49,150
myself currently I'm the principal

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,130
malware scientist at RS a net witness

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,850
were based in Reston Virginia but I work

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:59,630
from home in Atlanta Georgia so I

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,130
dedicated one of my rooms to be a lab so

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,020
during the wintertime I don't need to

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:08,959
turn on my heater because it's already

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:11,300
hot inside there and i'm the author of a

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,150
malware rootkits and botnets it's been

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,430
out since august of last year if you

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,350
have a book budget from your company

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,820
please get one all the proceeds go

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,840
directly to my kids 529 college fund

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:30,320
hopefully they'll make it here today

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,120
they're there 10 minutes away before

00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,100
joining our Senate witness i was with

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,110
ambala for three years i was the

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,010
resident malware researcher and reverser

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,200
and before that i was with f-secure so i

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,940
was based in California when I was in F

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,310
secure but then they assign me in

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:51,200
Malaysia for a year and a half to build

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,750
and lead their Asia R&D and before that

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,480
i was with the trend micro trend micro's

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,030
where i started my career i remember

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,739
when they were trying to recruit me when

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,110
I first when I graduated from college

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,540
they didn't send me an email they sent

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,220
me a telegram and I should have kept

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,470
that telegram it would have been nice

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,329
and I was telling my son about the

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,290
telegram and he doesn't have any idea

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,290
what the telegram is

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,989
even when I had my first decides shirt

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:24,820
it had a cassette tape there he also had

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:27,470
no idea what the cassette tape is and

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,360
you can follow me at twitter send me a

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:34,460
message if you have questions I'll be

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,890
more than happy to help out this is our

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,730
team our say first watch it's a new team

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:45,440
in RSA it's a it started last year I

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:47,960
think was April so you can read what we

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,630
do I always describe it as the GI Joe of

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:59,030
threat research and you can follow us at

00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:03,980
RSA first watch all right on with the

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,810
talk so the purpose is to understand the

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,370
tools and methods behind the staggering

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,850
number of malware discovered on a

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,490
periodic basis so for us to achieve that

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:18,470
purpose we will be talking about what

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,830
we're up against and what what are the

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,530
tools used by the attackers how they

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,630
combine those tools to achieve the

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,260
staggering number of malware that we see

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,260
every day and why do they do it what's

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,750
the advantage for them of doing it and

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:43,070
then i will show you a live demo of a

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:48,470
real malware automation system so if you

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,910
guys have a tea vendors every year you

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,120
probably get a report something like

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:57,200
this i usually term it as a horror story

00:05:52,120 --> 00:06:00,010
it's a it's a stat to horrify probably

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,780
your CIO or CISO to buy their products

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,669
but when you look at it at it deeper

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,520
it's actually true there's so many

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:10,460
malware that are coming out every day I

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,970
remember when I first started they would

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,490
assign me probably 5 malware a day but

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,229
now when you look at the queue it's

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,910
thousands and thousands and thousands

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:23,260
and sometimes you have to prioritize

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,780
based on customers whoever pays the

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,670
highest amount of money and then

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,500
you would always process their malware

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,350
problems first or their malware cases

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,680
first so here you can see the jump I

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,280
think the average right now is a I'm

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,389
just guessing I thinks around 55 to a

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:46,389
75,000 a day but uh I think we see

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,460
millions in a year but then again when

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,830
they define unique the way they define

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,320
unique is that if you get a file you

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,570
just add a small bite at the end of it

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,280
take a hash even though it's the same

00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:02,680
thing and they would define it already

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:06,340
seen it so before this is what we are up

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,080
against a lone wolf malware so if

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,180
there's going to be an outbreak usually

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,730
once you once you get a sample of that

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,900
malware you create a solution for it you

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,640
deploy that solution that solution would

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,850
actually stop the outbreak already

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,830
because it covers everything about the

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,900
matter because there's only one type of

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:31,780
malware sample that's been out there so

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:34,240
SQL slammer configure only one type but

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,060
now when it comes to attacks they use

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,400
different kinds of malware families so

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,250
aptly up against an army of armored

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,930
malware so even though you create a

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,760
solution for one because you were able

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,220
to capture that from a customer system

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,160
when you deploy it it doesn't mean that

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,350
it'll stop the attack probably he'll

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,610
stop the attack on that one piece of

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,340
malware that probably you wouldn't see

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,530
any more but then the rest the 999

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:05,410
thousand more you won't be able to stop

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:08,500
the attack so what are the tools the

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:13,030
attackers are using to achieve this we

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:16,750
have the DIY kits you have the armoring

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:20,350
tools the packers encrypter join us and

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:28,000
binders and they also use AV scanners

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:31,150
for quality assurance so DIY kits DIY

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,289
kits they're not new so you could

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,659
actually the first one that I are

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,969
actually touched early in my career is

00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,610
the one that's a

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:45,540
by someone from Chicago it's vcl it's

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,310
been around since 1992 you can still get

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,860
a sample of this from the internet just

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,529
google it before when VX heavens were

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:58,560
still up most of the old samples you

00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:01,709
could get from there and not not to be

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,250
outdone another group the PS MPC they

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:07,769
also create at their own DIY kit so the

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,350
main idea of this DIY kits is that it's

00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:12,600
very simple to create I mean to create a

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,319
malware you don't need to have assembly

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,329
language skills or even see coding

00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:21,120
skills to create your own malware all

00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:26,370
you need is just a just need to know the

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,800
command line commands the options type

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,199
them click enter and then it would

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,449
obliterate the malware for you so

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:36,689
there's no need to have all of those

00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:37,889
skills that you need that the Malheur

00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:44,069
attackers have to create your own

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:51,389
malware fast forward 15 20 years we get

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:52,769
spy I and we also get Zeus so it makes

00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,569
it much more easier for these kids

00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,750
because here just click and click and

00:09:54,569 --> 00:10:00,480
click and then you create your own

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,970
malware sample and currently the DIY

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,819
kits right now especially if they're new

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,290
they're really very expensive so for you

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:09,509
to be able to get their hands on them

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,089
you have to have the budget and then you

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,399
have to have a trusted entity in the

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:18,509
hacker underground so when I say trusted

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,790
entity someone who's been you guys have

00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:22,620
ebay accounts right so a hacker

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:28,589
Underground's like a combination of an

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:31,680
Amazon and eBay site so each kit or each

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:34,889
a malware technology tool they would

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,800
have ratings they have five stars or

00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:39,990
rating of one to ten and then the

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,910
sellers and buyers like eBay they would

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,559
also have their own rating because they

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,449
wouldn't just sell it to anyone who they

00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,819
don't trust because they would always

00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:49,290
think that some some some of that people

00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:52,439
are probably from law enforcement or

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,889
from other 80 companies so to be able to

00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,230
get in

00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,600
you must have an entity that has been

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:01,379
there for a long time so usually it's a

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,239
long process or you can always wait for

00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,819
somebody to lick it out in the internet

00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:08,730
like what the tools i'll be showing you

00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:11,939
in my demo later they're all leaked out

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:15,230
so if you know how to find them just use

00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:17,939
google you'd be able to find the kids

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:23,910
but my contract with my company prevents

00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:26,489
me from showing you how to find it so

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:29,040
the main idea of DIY kits is and i've

00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:31,019
mentioned this already it's very easy to

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,790
create malware it you have the power to

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,149
create malware you don't need to have

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,220
the assembly language skills and DIY

00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:41,100
kids nowadays compared to DIY kits

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,480
before is that they're more potent

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,629
they're more dangerous they're more

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,339
armored and there you can only get them

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:53,879
for a for a price and the reason behind

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:57,029
the rise of DIY kits now compared to

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,669
before is that before when happe

00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,739
sponsors sponsors like state entities

00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:05,489
other companies or individuals that want

00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:07,259
to attack another entity usually they

00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:11,100
would converse directly with the malware

00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,749
writers but it's easy to go it's easy to

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,879
track the malware writers when it comes

00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:18,149
to that process so what they did is

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,850
instead of them communicating directly

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,519
to the sponsors they would just create a

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,379
kit and and then they will just give

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,519
them license or codes to unlock certain

00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:32,129
functionalities that the sponsor need so

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,429
if everything's goes out there out of

00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:37,079
the picture they will have the kit but

00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:42,119
they won't have the people who actually

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:44,489
wrote the kid so the DIY kits themselves

00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:47,309
themselves already have armoring

00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:50,970
technology in them so the way it works

00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:53,459
is that it can create infinite amount of

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,759
samples infinite amount of unique

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:59,730
samples now when I say unique here it's

00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:02,999
like a metamorphic so metamorphic means

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,189
it's different on disk the way it

00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:06,040
appears on disk and the way it appears

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,769
in memory

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,800
it's totally different so if you're not

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,079
familiar with the kids and the samples

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,440
they create some AV researchers with

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,180
everything one sample is different from

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,399
another sample from another sample from

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,490
another sample but when in fact it only

00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,410
came from a single kid so it it can

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,779
create infinite amount of unique matter

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,930
samples because it uses time and date as

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:38,110
a seed so as long as time exists it

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:41,620
would create a unique sample now hackers

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,660
or i should say attackers because not

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,759
all hackers are bad i think it's a

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:52,899
misnomer they don't rely on the armoring

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:55,540
tools of kids all the time they also

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:59,230
utilize armoring tools so the most

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:04,420
common arming tools are packers so one

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:06,100
of them are you PX p light the meda some

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,319
of them are third-party legitimate

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,389
software and that prevents us from

00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:13,709
reverse engineering it because once we

00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:17,079
reverse-engineer a third-party

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:20,170
encryption software or a packer that's

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:22,240
for legitimate software purposes then

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,540
we're violating their EULA so it's a

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,449
sticky situation but if it's a tool that

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,670
it's from the underground it's we can

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:35,560
reverse it anytime without the fear of

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:37,120
our being soon now the main idea of

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,899
arming tools is that they could have

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,339
different packaging of this but then

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,769
when you look at the codes that they

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:50,050
attach or the way they encrypt the

00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:53,589
samples the way they do it is that the

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,439
source code in it in itself some of them

00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:59,769
are the same so it's either they steal

00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:03,100
from other AV writer I mean malware

00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:06,579
writers they get leaked codes and then

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,130
repackage it as their own and exciting

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:11,860
part about most of these tools is that

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,100
they would have different options like

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,470
here it says additional options but then

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,190
some of them when you try them out and

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,730
then when you check them someone

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,200
don't work so I'm not so sure probably

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,150
because the license that they would

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:32,350
grant he would only activate specific

00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:34,820
functions or probably just doesn't work

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,320
they would add it there they would say

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,760
okay we have all of these features but

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,350
in fact none of them work and they India

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,950
and the good thing about having all of

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:49,310
these tools and all of these kids is

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:53,180
that you can have a i'd say i call it

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:57,020
upon exe so it's an executable that i

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,460
know inside and out and then i apply all

00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,140
of these arming tools and whatever

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,750
changes that has been done to that

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,460
executable then those are the things i

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:09,740
try to reverse and find out what they

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:12,980
added to that executable and not all

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,690
armoring tools are our tools that you

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,790
can run in your system some of them are

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,460
offered online this is one thing i found

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,380
this is one I found in deductibles net

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,320
when I was doing my experiment on this

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,680
this was free so you can upload all of

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,570
your creations here but of course

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,340
whoever owns this site means they get a

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,130
copy of what every uploaded them and

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,830
that copy they could actually sell it in

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,360
the underground so if you have a kid if

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,970
you want to sell samples you can create

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,770
samples you can you could sell one

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,710
unique sample in the underground for one

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:48,830
cent so if you have a 100 that's a

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:51,530
dollar if you have 1000 that's ten

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,330
dollars and later I'll show you how

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,210
possible it is to create a million

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,720
samples just by not doing anything just

00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:01,250
clicking some buttons and then you can

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,420
relax and then just look at the samples

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,980
being created oh and right now this you

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,040
cannot access it for free anymore you

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,420
need to get a code to access this but I

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,040
haven't checked it yet before I came

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:21,290
here but the last time I checked it's

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:23,689
not free anymore so this is 1 this is

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,990
one of my favorites joiners they're also

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:29,450
called binders so before the infection

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,630
routine is built into the malware

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,420
because most of the malware we see there

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,910
called computer viruses before they

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,700
attach themselves to files and if you

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,440
infect a file that's enticing chances

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,200
are that file would be executed in the

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,220
system in which that file has been

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,820
executed on would get infected but right

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,280
now since creating infection routine is

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,050
a dying art what the heck what the

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,560
attackers did is that they created tools

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:03,320
that would actually attach a malicious

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,760
file to a benign file so it's like they

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,460
made the infection routine into a tool

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,520
so the main advantage of this is that

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,850
you can get any popular app or any

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,430
popular program today and then just

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,680
attach your creation to that popular

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,060
file and then spread it you can spam it

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,160
you can post it in free websites free

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,160
file hosting sites or you could just

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,110
install a peer-to-peer file sharing

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,730
program in your system and then share it

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:41,270
there so when this first came out the

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,460
solutions that were taught off by

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,170
software publishers is that every time

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,750
they would post something in their

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:51,290
website a program they would put the

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,000
hash there the program so that you would

00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,740
be ensured that what you're downloading

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,960
is the one that came from the publisher

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,720
but of course if you if you're able to

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,030
compromise the website you can always

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:08,360
change the md5 or the sha-1 hash that

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:11,480
they post there so this is a the same as

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,180
what I mentioned it's called X a bundle

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,650
so as I've mentioned before the main

00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,160
idea there is that they would have

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:22,130
different GUI they would have different

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,480
functionality but still it's the same

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:28,520
thing oh by the way guys if you buy the

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,760
book you'll send those two kids to

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:40,040
college so please get a copy of

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:43,190
of the book so when you attack someone

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,990
you want to make sure that your creation

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:49,700
would be able to get into the system so

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,740
one of the tools they use Rav scanners

00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,980
of course there are other security

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,870
products out there so they only they not

00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,770
only test it against AV scanners they

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,540
also tested against like firewall and

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:05,660
whatever security products that are very

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,670
popular out there right now but when it

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,520
comes to AV scanners this is the one

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:13,520
that's most popular with the attackers

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,320
so it's its in-house you could install

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,660
it in your system I mean it's on premise

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,020
you could install it in your system and

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,540
the way it works is that this would

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,910
actually modify the engines of the AV

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,190
products that are supported so when I

00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,560
say modify the engines it means that

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,920
they can run multiple products in one

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:37,340
system without actually killing the

00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,690
other AV vendor that's installed but

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,960
there's a disadvantage to this

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,300
implementation because sometimes when

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,780
they actually modify a certain dll of an

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,700
AV Prada whatever functionality let's

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,340
say dynamic scanning functionality for

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,250
that product sometimes they kill it so

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,870
it's not as effective so what they do to

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,140
fix it is that they would just have

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,790
different vm implementations and then

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,440
they would install the most popular AV

00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:07,220
products there and then they would run

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,140
their creation there but if they don't

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,020
have this tool and did and then they and

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:15,050
they don't have any budget they could

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,940
always use an online scanning tool so

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,130
the most popular for research with

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,590
researchers is virustotal before

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,190
attackers use it but then they found out

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,290
that if you upload the sample there it

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,470
gets distributed to AV companies so it

00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:33,440
kills the purpose but some of them they

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,440
still take advantage of it because what

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,990
happens is that those samples that get

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,370
distributed to the AV companies given

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,810
that there are thousands and thousands

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,160
and thousands of samples that Ava

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,070
companies

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,710
receive they go to the bottom of the

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:52,010
queue so let's say if you receive 10,000

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,720
samples today that would be 10,000 that

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,910
would be in ten thousand and one queue

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,490
so chances are of it being processed

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,710
probably take them like a week or even

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:04,850
months so some of them still take

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:06,740
advantage of using virustotal but the

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,830
most popular one is a no virus thanks

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,530
this is one there more because this one

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,410
has the option that says do not

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,610
distribute with AV companies but of

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:22,130
course you're not sure whether they're

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:25,280
really distributing it or not now how do

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:29,180
they combine these tools so first you

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:33,650
have the DIY kit malware it produces

00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:35,660
samples and then it it go through

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,450
different armoring tools so you can

00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,930
apply different arming tools many times

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,840
to tell creation now the difference with

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,880
this method compared to the method that

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,980
we've been seeing in the early 90s is

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,520
that before computing power is not cheap

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,010
so every time we do modification in your

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,200
creation it takes a lot of computing

00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,900
computing power and also memory and it

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,280
slows down the system but now since most

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,210
of the computers we see are very

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,640
powerful the CPUs are faster ram is

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,780
cheap the attackers don't mind putting

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,400
lots of armoring in their creation to

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:19,630
actually protect them from being

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:23,150
discovered now once they create their

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,340
armored malware then they would conduct

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,310
the quality assurance and that is they

00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,080
would check it against different

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:33,710
security products to determine whether

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,440
it's detected or not now if this is an

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:40,010
apt and they want to attack a certain

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,200
company the first thing they would do is

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,110
that they would find out what that

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,490
company is using to protect themselves

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,830
now most of those information you don't

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,350
need to have sophisticated hacking

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,180
skills sometimes you just need to go to

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,390
job posting boards especially if they

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,500
have an opening for an admin job because

00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,590
sometimes all of the infirm

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,260
are there they say you have to be a you

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,170
have to be an expert in this OS you have

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,840
to be an expert in managing this

00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,390
security product and all that so they're

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,930
able to determine what's protecting that

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:17,330
company and sometimes let's say it's

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:20,020
using AV vendor a and then they tested

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,730
it it's detected by AV vendor C and B

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,390
but it's not detected by AV vendor a

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,040
they would still conduct the attack and

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:31,490
anyway given that they're able to create

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,230
malware in seconds they don't mind that

00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,670
certain malware being captured because

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,920
they could just change it to another one

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:42,800
that's purely undetected which I will

00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:44,510
explain later and another thing where

00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,060
they get this information is they also

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,160
get it from a technical exchange forums

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,710
because some people would actually use

00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,620
the real email address in those forums

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,450
now those that are smart enough to not

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,960
use their real email address or their

00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,790
company email address some of them when

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,680
they copy paste a message from somebody

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,930
within the company sometimes they forget

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,540
to remove the signature that contains

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,140
the company name so getting all of this

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:16,340
information is a very easy again Google

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,130
is a very nice to just need to google so

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,420
after this they're able to create their

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:25,850
army of armored malware now del UI kit

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,800
is not only the source of samples

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,460
because sometimes it's hard to get your

00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,920
hands on DIY kits so what you can do is

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,080
that you could use old malware so I

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,420
usually had had a talk before I

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,190
demonstrate to this I called it the

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,090
green malware made from one hundred

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:46,310
percent recycled malware you just run it

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,230
in the two in different arming tools and

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:53,330
that malware would become undetected

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:55,520
again so there there's been cases that

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,140
I've seen that they would say they've

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,350
been attacked by a very sophisticated

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:03,050
malware but then when you peel that

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,660
malware you remove all the armory that

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,310
sample is five years old so it's just

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,770
new and sophisticated because they got

00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,120
attacked by it but then when you peel

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,460
all of the armory

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,010
you find out that it's a it's an old

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,470
malware and it's easy to get the old

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:22,130
malware especially most of you probably

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,230
all of your technical guys I'm guessing

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,910
you get late night calls from your

00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,700
relatives who have problems with their

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,470
pc and then when you go to that pc

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,760
remote control it you'll likely see

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,010
different files and then when you look

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,200
at those files those files are already

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:41,510
infected with some sort of malware and

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:44,960
those are good source of malware so why

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:48,710
do they do it exponential effect

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:54,440
strength in numbers easy malware update

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:56,750
and do not AV out now let's go to the

00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,500
exponential effect so as I've mentioned

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:04,820
before with the malware DIY kits you can

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:08,600
create infinite amount of unique malware

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:11,780
samples as long as time exists you can

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,390
create a unique malware sample and the

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:17,270
way they create unique samples that they

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:21,620
just don't add bytes to get a different

00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:23,150
hash it's metamorphic so what you see on

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,840
disk and what you see on memory is

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:29,030
totally different from each sample and

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,050
then you let's say you run one sample

00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:38,240
against one armoring tool so you get a

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:42,470
variation at that sample and then you

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,570
run it against another arming pool and

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,890
then you did and so on and so on and so

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:53,000
forth so you get infinite virtually

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:55,850
infinite amount of malware samples and

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,400
that's as I have said you can at least

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,309
sell one sample one sent in the

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,200
underground so this is a good money

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:05,630
making scheme so you just need to have a

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,150
bare metal system and the free vm

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,720
license and then you can create this but

00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,400
again my contract forbids me to to tell

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:21,620
you how to exactly do it but i'll show

00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:24,530
you how it works easy malware update

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,920
so unique samples / malware deployment

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:30,640
technology so when when an attack is

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,930
conducted the attackers use different

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,320
deployment technology the most popular

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:40,850
is email drive-by download sites and USB

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,530
so if you see some people in front of

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,280
your office giving out free us beasts

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:50,180
and then you plug it in your system and

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,320
you have a autorun enable it enabled in

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,530
your system chances are you'll get

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,679
infected so USB still being used to be

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,450
to deploy malware and I think there were

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,250
some cases a couple of years back or

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,400
probably five years ago Korean people

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,470
would get discs and USBS from

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,770
conferences and then those CSB's would

00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:12,770
turned out to be a carrying malware so

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,420
in a threat ecosystem the tragical

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,610
system is made up of different parts

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,590
athlete are two major components the

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,960
human element and the technical element

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,630
so the human element they're the

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,100
sponsors they're the malware writers

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,880
they're the people behind the threat

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,850
ecosystem and the threat ecosystem the

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,480
technical elements one of the one of the

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:37,490
parts there is the deployment technology

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,500
so the deployment technology is owned by

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,720
somebody else it's not owned by the

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,120
sponsor it's not owned by the malware

00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:50,090
writers so what happens there is that

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:53,240
taking a spam email for example usually

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:57,140
each email spam would contain a unique

00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,350
malware sample so if your company a you

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:04,010
get bombarded by a spam email and you

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:06,860
find and you find out that it's a it's

00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,050
infected and you forward it to your AV

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,179
vendor or their security vendor and then

00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,590
they would probably after a couple of

00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,510
days they would come back to you okay

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,700
you have we now have a solution for this

00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,820
deploy it in your system you're happy

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,480
you deploy it and then you'll call them

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,940
again saying nothing's happening but

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,650
then when I tested it in the against the

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,380
sample I've send it to you it gets

00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:31,519
detected but still information is

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,639
getting a

00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:38,070
stolen from my systems the reality there

00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:41,120
is that because that sample that you've

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:45,360
received you won't see it ever again

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:48,750
because each deployment spam would have

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,220
would contain one unique sample so

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,149
that's why when we communicate with each

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,220
other using md5 to identify a sample

00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:59,279
it's not really effective because that

00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:03,600
md5 you won't see it ever again you'll

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:07,769
just see it in that one email so the

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,559
security vendor they actually solve the

00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:13,620
problem of detecting that one sample out

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:20,730
of 100,000 samples that's being used for

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:23,009
that one specific attack and another

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:25,350
thing about the updating malware's that

00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:30,059
malware serving domains can rotate

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:33,450
malware in minutes so in a botnet

00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:35,399
infrastructure so botnets use different

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,840
kinds of a network infrastructure and

00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,210
one of them is the malware serving the

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,029
main so the malware serving domain is

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,549
different from a CNC in a way that the

00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:47,940
CNC whatever you put in a CNC in that

00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:50,659
channel it would actually influence the

00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,860
behavior of the malware in the system

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:55,860
but when it comes to malware serving

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,080
domains the master serving domain is the

00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,450
one that hosts updates it hosts the

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,879
malware updates it hosts a configuration

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:07,139
files it hosts whatever files that the

00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:09,779
malware needs so here if the one in your

00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:13,529
system gets captured and then sent your

00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:15,480
AV product that probably that probably

00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:18,240
spend a couple of hours on it a day and

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,419
then they'll deploy the solution but

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,789
then if the attacker would actually have

00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:26,730
a rule in that attack that says every

00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:29,190
six minutes every hour update that

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,570
mallory sample in that system so even

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,730
though they capture that one malware

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:35,669
sample if it gets updated with another

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:38,070
one if you deploy that technology it

00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:39,960
won't stop the attack so it would stop

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,179
it would detect that one piece of

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,100
malware that doesn't exist anymore in

00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,750
your system because it's already updated

00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,950
so the attackers could

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:52,350
let me say update that Mallard creation

00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:55,320
let's say every 3 a.m. so that nobody

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,940
would notice or every hour if they're

00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,620
really bold enough they could probably

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,520
say every minute but then it would have

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,990
lots of noise you if you have love if

00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,770
you have logging mechanisms in your

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:12,180
network that would be very easy to spot

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:16,110
and not AV out this is a everybody knows

00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,690
this already so malvel creation time

00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:20,850
versus solution cycle time so malleable

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,900
creation time I would show you later it

00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,850
just takes seconds to create a malware

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,790
but once you created but solution cycle

00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:32,010
time that's the time we're in the AV

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,470
researchers get the malware sample and

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,850
then they create a solution for it i

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,130
remember when i was in trend micro our

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,480
fastest is two hours our promise is all

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,580
these two hours especially if you're a

00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,790
high paying customer and if we're not

00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,760
able to solve that malware sample we

00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:51,450
give you back your money now that only

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,540
uh that's only detection it doesn't

00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:58,230
include the cleanup because malware

00:33:54,540 --> 00:34:00,060
today there's their sophisticated that

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,980
they embed themselves deep into the

00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,950
operating system that removing the

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,470
malware would a clear destroy the

00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:10,379
operating system so it's like an alien

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,870
right so it attaches itself to the human

00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:14,760
host so once you remove that alien from

00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:19,169
the human host if you're watching

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,110
falling skies I think I think jun 9th is

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:23,790
a the second season once you remove that

00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,409
alien from the human host chances are

00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,639
the human host would die it's the same

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,919
thing with the operating system

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,659
especially the malware is complicated

00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:35,730
enough to embed itself in the operating

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:39,210
system and given the tools that are

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:41,639
available to the attackers today most AV

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:45,200
evasion techniques are effectively

00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:47,760
utilized so unlike before you have to go

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,889
to a certain group of malware writers

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,440
that are experts in hiding their

00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,480
creations or in using a certain AV

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,720
technology to be able to utilize the

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,190
technology but now you could aptly just

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,380
buy a tool

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:05,040
or use a leaked one or if you're a

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,290
hobbyist modified the codes in those

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,230
tools and then you can actually learn

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:13,380
how to how most of those malware

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,109
technology work so you don't need to

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,000
communicate to somebody who's well with

00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:20,069
an expert in a certain modern technology

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,170
all of those technology are now in your

00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:25,079
hands so most of the attackers they can

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:29,790
effectively utilized most of those a V

00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:33,750
evasion techniques and since most of the

00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,760
creation they're metamorphic when it

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,060
comes to creating signatures for them

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,420
especially if the AV vendors or security

00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,010
vendors are using an automated system

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,690
even their signature creation right now

00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,630
it's automated so what happens it is

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,369
that it becomes a 1 is to 1 say if an

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,540
attack contains 100 thousand unique

00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:57,150
samples that's 100,000 unique signatures

00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,490
from the AV company and of course that

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,160
won't scale so if you have updates

00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,290
that's more than 5 Meg ask your AV

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,780
provider or your security provider

00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:08,579
questions like how do you approach this

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,730
problem of malware kids how do you

00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:13,740
differentiate a creation of one kid from

00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:17,310
another and how do you differentiate an

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:19,230
armored malware from another armored mal

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,000
you're using different kinds of tools so

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,560
those are very good questions to ask

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,849
especially if you're going to meet with

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:31,589
your security providers and

00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:33,300
understanding the malware because if you

00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,890
really want to go to the root of things

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,060
to understand what's going on you really

00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:40,410
have to reverse it now for me standing

00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,500
here in front of you it's very easy to

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:46,200
say oh just reverse this reverse that

00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,109
reverse this and then you'll find out

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:53,130
but in reality reversing takes a lot of

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:55,440
time like I could get a sample I could I

00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,950
could probably reverse it in an hour if

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,810
it's really really really easy but if

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,230
it's an average malware sometimes it

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,569
takes me days weeks even months

00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,250
depending on the difficulty and

00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:10,890
sometimes I cannot do it alone I need to

00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,940
ask the help of other researchers to

00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,480
help me a reverse

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,600
and imagine if you do that one malware

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,290
sample that the attackers would actually

00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,500
deploy it won't scale so it would take

00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:28,740
you let's say if we're very optimistic

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,560
one malware sample to reverse a day and

00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:34,800
it creates the it it takes them one

00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:40,590
second to create one it just doesn't

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,770
make sense all right let's go see the

00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,770
demo

00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,130
so in this specific demo we would be

00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,130
using a Zeus

00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:20,849
so this is running in a slow motion in

00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,500
reality it could be faster so this one

00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:25,770
represents the number of malware that's

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,500
being created right now so that's unique

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:31,260
malware not unique as defined by

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:34,710
security providers were in different

00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:37,530
hashes this is unique in a way that it's

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:42,540
different in the disk and also in memory

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:49,380
so it's a metamorphic unique see now we

00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:52,770
have eight we have 9 so if you're the

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:57,300
attacker you could be in jail you could

00:38:52,770 --> 00:39:00,359
send a Twitter message to let's say

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:04,710
using a Twitter account that you've

00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:07,800
specially set up to control this and you

00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:10,260
would be able to activate this so I had

00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,390
the top I think it was a couple of years

00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,940
ago it's a follow my botnet in Twitter

00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,089
I've demonstrated it there how you can

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,280
use Twitter to actually control systems

00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,530
like this and any malware that you would

00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,829
have on your system so same concept

00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:28,109
applies here so it just turn this on you

00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:31,349
can go out for a lunch break go watch a

00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:33,780
movie line up for Superman and then when

00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:36,210
you come back this would be in the

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,430
thousands by the way the system is set

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,200
up for educational purposes only I

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,660
cannot take out any of the samples out

00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,710
of here after this all of the samples

00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,549
would be destroyed I have to say that

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,549
for the camera

00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,130
so that's Zeus and now I will show you

00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:04,070
how how we automate armoring so that's

00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:06,520
one is to showing how to create malware

00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:11,980
using DIY kits in an automated fashion

00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,980
even if it's a UI based DIY kit

00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:31,229
so what while I was talking we were able

00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:33,749
to create 36 malware samples even if you

00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:35,369
go on a bio break when you come back

00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:38,659
we'll probably have hundreds of samples

00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:38,659
in your system

00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:56,680
so in this demo we would use a saw so as

00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,840
you can see here so has different

00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:04,330
options it has different kinds of a anti

00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,710
sandboxing technologies some of these

00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,530
technology some of these technologies

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,570
they work when I tried it some of them

00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,720
didn't and not so sure if my experiment

00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:15,970
is the one that has a problem but if you

00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,770
get tools like this don't the main

00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,680
lesson here is that I don't believe

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:22,960
whatever you see in the options or in

00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,080
the in the feature list because chances

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,110
are some of them they don't work they

00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,210
just put it there to convince newbies or

00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:34,120
buying this that they would have their

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:43,900
creation protected or have those Mouser

00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:46,930
technology applied to their creation so

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:52,870
this is getting 11 of that one creation

00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:56,230
that we did using our sandbox so that's

00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:59,140
just one malware sample and then out of

00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,000
that you could create this and this

00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:05,110
specific tool it doesn't use date and

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,200
time to encrypt the malware as a seed it

00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:12,490
actually uses a random characters or

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,010
random string now this one you can

00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:17,740
randomize the string but in the eighth

00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:21,220
in the 80s and early 90s the way this

00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,490
works is that those string characters

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,430
you actually get it from the executable

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,500
itself on a specific location but as I

00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,960
mentioned most of those functionalities

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:35,680
are now automated did I see someone

00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:38,380
raised their hand so while I was talking

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,380
we were able to create 10 armored

00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,180
malware and again those are unique so

00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,360
the malware the created matter is

00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,070
already unique to begin with and then

00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:52,180
you make them more unique plus you add

00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:54,070
more armoring to it and if the malware

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,780
and if the AV researchers don't have

00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,790
access to the kit it's hard for them to

00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,430
understand especially if they only have

00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:02,160
the samples what that sample is doing or

00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,440
what's going on with that sample

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,470
probably when they reverse it just

00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,809
reversing the armor part would take them

00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,789
a couple of days and then reversing the

00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:14,069
encryption provided by the DIY kit

00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:16,950
another couple of days and then to find

00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:18,539
out the real functionality of that

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,490
malware would take them another let's

00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:22,170
say a couple of days but I'm being

00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:27,240
optimistic saying couple of days in

00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:30,720
reality sometimes it takes weeks so if

00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,230
you hear someone telling you oh I I was

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,660
able to reverse that in a couple of days

00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:38,490
chances are he didn't probably just read

00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,740
the blog in the internet somewhere and

00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:43,319
is able to pass it off like oh this is

00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,180
my findings but at me just read it

00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:50,819
somewhere and said and he said oh yeah

00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:53,660
this is how it works so that's how easy

00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:53,660
it is and

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:11,349
so how does it work in a system how it

00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,000
is how do they really implement it it's

00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:15,819
actly very cheap for the malware writers

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,640
you just need a bare metal system any

00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:23,500
cheap bare metal system that can host

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:28,990
multiple VM images you could have one VM

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:31,599
image for your DIY kit and then another

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:33,010
image for your tools whirring tools you

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,470
could have different multiple images

00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:38,920
depending on your need you can even have

00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:40,210
an image for your AV scanners so the

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,030
good thing about this is that you could

00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:48,130
utilize shared folders between the host

00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:49,690
and the guest and that shared folder you

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:53,470
could drop all of your creation there

00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:55,930
and you could have an agent or script

00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,849
running in the bare metal system that

00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,710
monitors if that directory is filled

00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:02,980
with something and then if it is it just

00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:05,349
pass it to the armory pool image so it

00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,559
gets processed and then you will get

00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:10,990
assists and then just drop everything in

00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:16,200
one folder that have all the armoured

00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:19,750
samples and then just sit back relax

00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,700
wait for your samples so you could you

00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,099
could go out watch your kids baseball

00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,799
game watch a movie and then come back

00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:31,150
and you will have tons and tons of

00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:34,809
samples see how relax is how easy it is

00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:40,630
for him to create an army of armored

00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:42,700
malware so that's it that's my top for

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:51,700
the day if you have any questions please

00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:54,609
feel free to ask them yep ha so for each

00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:57,460
for each reverser there's different

00:45:54,609 --> 00:46:00,880
techniques but for me what I do is that

00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:03,940
I don't reverse it immediately around it

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,549
first in a sandbox so I run it in a

00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,130
virtualized sandbox if nothing happens

00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:11,500
then I go to bare metal sandbox and then

00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,450
if nothing happens that's when I aptly

00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,100
put it in my own malware test

00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,230
environment it's a bare metal system

00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,300
the it's not automated wherein it

00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,100
doesn't have a time limit to run the

00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,320
mother and let's say in just 30 seconds

00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,410
or three minutes so there I will just

00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,660
let it run I would use different

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:33,470
monitoring tools sysinternals it's a

00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:37,970
good source and then monitor the network

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,440
and see so there's this one too that

00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,540
I've used before you just plug it in

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,920
instead of installing were sharp in your

00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,420
system because some malware would

00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,280
actually detect whether Wireshark is

00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,280
running and they won't do anything and

00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,340
it's able to get all the packets that

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,310
you need so if I get all the information

00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,490
from there then I would stop because

00:46:55,310 --> 00:47:00,200
then from there from all of those

00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,150
information I could describe what the

00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,550
malware is doing and what kind of

00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,740
information is is the matter stealing

00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:09,080
out now let's say none of those work

00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,270
then that's the time I would reverse the

00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:14,420
malware so what I would do is that

00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,730
actually have two screens so one screen

00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,570
without the decompile there disassembled

00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:22,670
code using either and another screen

00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:25,790
that's active we're in I'm debugging the

00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:29,510
malware so the way I debug the malware

00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:32,570
is that that we the screen with a

00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:35,360
disassembled code is my guide so I'm

00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:36,830
making sure that whatever code it says

00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:41,330
here that's after all code that the

00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:42,860
bugger is a going to now sometimes what

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,650
happens is that it's totally different

00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,290
and then what I will do I would Google

00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:51,320
look at different things that other

00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:53,780
researchers have done and sometimes

00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,450
especially the Mallory's all there would

00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,390
already be plugins available special if

00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:01,250
you are using Ollie debug and those

00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,410
plugins would make life easier for you

00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,500
because they would some of them would

00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:09,560
have we solve the encryption already you

00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,720
just put that plug in activate it and

00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,520
then all of that would be taken away all

00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,290
of the earth all of the armoring stuff

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,160
would be taken away and then it would be

00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:23,090
left with her with the code and then you

00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:27,830
could follow it again so even though I

00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:29,329
reverse malware for a living when it

00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,009
comes to reversing

00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:34,430
if you could get all the information you

00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:36,799
can without reversing the malware then

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:40,309
that's it because malware when you look

00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:42,469
at it it's so complicated and it it

00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:44,839
doesn't make sense to spend that much

00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:47,690
time on other functionality when in fact

00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,549
we've already uncovered the big the main

00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:51,739
directive the main functionality that

00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:54,289
the Mallory needs to conduct its attack

00:48:51,739 --> 00:49:11,989
so hopefully I was able to answer your

00:48:54,289 --> 00:49:15,079
question okay for me if I see something

00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:17,029
new it hardly gets me excited because

00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:20,599
number one it's new it's a chance for me

00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:22,729
to learn something as well like most of

00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:24,259
the things that I've learned when it

00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:26,420
comes to Malraux technology I didn't

00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:27,680
learn it from the company from the

00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,469
companies that employed me I actually

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:34,660
learned it from the malware themselves

00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:37,940
now what worries me is that most

00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,769
security vendors even though the

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,709
research group or their technical group

00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:46,809
is aware of this there's nothing they

00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:51,559
can do especially if it doesn't sell

00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:55,910
like research in a company research

00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:58,130
doesn't have that ROI compared to other

00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,469
departments in the company so when you

00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,699
ask for budget about something

00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:03,979
especially if you want to pursue a

00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:07,219
certain research because you found out

00:50:03,979 --> 00:50:09,680
that we need a new kind of a solution

00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:11,359
solution and you cutting edge solution

00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,079
to solve this but then it would require

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:17,180
research time sometimes even the

00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:19,459
manpower to do that research let's say i

00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,969
would like to allocate one month of my

00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:25,940
time just to research that thing

00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:27,319
sometimes it won't be approved because

00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,640
then there would be lots of a fire

00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:35,089
fighting going on for me to to take care

00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,739
of now that worries me because the

00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:39,410
mallory writers they're not waiting for

00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:41,239
us to do something about it they're

00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,980
actually happy with us not doing

00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:46,010
anything about it because the

00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:50,119
so many hindrances when it comes to the

00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:52,250
bad guys unlike for them a teenager in a

00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,340
basement in Europe he could come up with

00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:59,080
a malware technology post it in a forum

00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:01,940
and then I have someone contact him and

00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,580
probably say okay don't make this in

00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,230
total work directly with us we'll pay

00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,930
you a hundred thousand dollars per

00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,780
technology that you produce for us now

00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:14,210
for them it's very easy but for us it's

00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,460
not as easy because you have to go to

00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:18,830
different things so that's the only

00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,570
thing that works me in the industry all

00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:22,250
of the technical people you talk with

00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,280
even those work in a three vendors

00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:27,619
they're aware of the problem but then

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:32,869
doing something about it there are lots

00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:35,440
of hindrances within the company that's

00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:35,440
good that's good

00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:54,600
oh yeah yep even before those companies

00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:56,430
came into existence Mallory already has

00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,170
the technology to detect whether it's

00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:00,570
running in some sort of a virtualized

00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:02,550
environment even if you try to hide the

00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,960
fact that it's running in a virtualized

00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,060
environment there would still be

00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,880
telltale signs that it's running in a

00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,770
virtualized environment so that's why

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,370
reversing those types of malware is fun

00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:16,860
because you get to learn things that

00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,660
let's say oh I didn't know that even

00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:20,280
though if I change this this certain

00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,470
memory location would still have these

00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,760
kinds of strings and flags that would

00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,450
say I'm running in a virtualized

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,970
environment and the danger about those

00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:32,850
kinds of solutions is that sometimes

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:35,550
they work on a timed basis let's say

00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:37,650
it's only 30 seconds only one minute

00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:39,000
only three minutes if I'm a malware who

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,380
wants to attack somebody who's using

00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,040
those kinds of solution I could just

00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,360
tell my malware my deployment technology

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,700
which is totally different from the

00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,310
malware that's being delivered it's a it

00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,880
have a discussion of that in my book so

00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:57,510
that certain malware I could set it up

00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,700
in a way do not do anything after one

00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,530
hour or after two hours or after three

00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,020
hours and if you do something after an

00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:07,350
hour why not connect to this website

00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,850
first to check whether you're connected

00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,720
to the internet connect to this benign

00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:14,040
side connected this benign side and then

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,960
try and then that's the only time you

00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,000
would try to do whatever it is you need

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,010
to do probably after an hour that's the

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,030
time it would set up its persistency

00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:27,120
when I say set up its persistency make

00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:29,190
sure that it would stay alive even after

00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:33,690
the servers or systems have been

00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:35,670
rebooted or have been shut down so if

00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,950
you are running a sandbox environment

00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:40,380
chances are it would only detect the

00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:42,810
behavior of the deployment technology

00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:47,090
the dropper or the downloader and it

00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:50,280
would not detect the actual malware

00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:52,530
that's being installed in your system by

00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,850
the way a dropper and a downloader

00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,460
they're different from the Malheur

00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:58,050
because they just carry the malware with

00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,720
them so the difference between a dropper

00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:03,630
and a downloader is that a dropper has

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,760
the malware in it already so once you

00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:08,130
run it in your system it would install

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,870
the malware now the downloader it's much

00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,430
more smaller issue it's less than one

00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:15,330
make sometimes like three hundred

00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:17,730
kilobytes that thing would need a

00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,490
malware serving domain to actually

00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:23,040
download that'll malware that it would

00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:25,380
install and most of these solutions they

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,580
only take even though they say we cover

00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:31,470
the first stage second stage third stage

00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:33,210
fourth stage now the next question to

00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:35,040
ask them what if the malware has a

00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,470
delaying mechanism what if the malware

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,160
has a timing mechanism what if the

00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:45,060
malware uses variables that are only

00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,860
found in certain systems that we cannot

00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,480
find in a virtualized environment so

00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:51,390
those are the things that you need to

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,490
ask them now the people work in those

00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,230
companies the companies you mentioned

00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,240
they're smart and they know these

00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,770
problems but then again as I'm saying

00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,960
there's lots of hindrances within the

00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:03,720
company to pursue research that would

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,580
actually create a cutting-edge solution

00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:13,260
for these problems any more questions

00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:15,810
violent reactions if not then that's it

00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,370
again the besides organizers thank you

00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,170
for inviting me it's an honor to be the

00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:23,000
first speaker in the first ever besides

00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:23,000
Charlotte thank you thank you guys

00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,200
most enterprises today realize that

00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,850
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,460
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:40,290
unauthorized intrusions that's like two

00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,330
factor authentication has gotten so

00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:44,430
popular lately that adds that extra

00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:47,100
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,870
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,090
know is that some two-factor

00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:53,280
authentication solutions they're better

00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:56,340
than others like two-factor strong

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,620
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,570
beyond other authentication systems by

00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:03,630
being less expensive easier to implement

00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:06,090
and easier to use giving software-based

00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:08,970
token clients built to run on all major

00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:11,570
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:13,890
Android these tokens utilize a

00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:16,290
public/private key combination that's

00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:18,240
generated on device so there aren't any

00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,760
shared secrets flying around or

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,640
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,500
special handling instead all keys are

00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,960
kept secure and private between the

00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,150
requesting token and your server which

00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,790
you control a mouse making it the most

00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,440
secure way possible to perform

00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:37,260
authentication encryption and with an

00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,020
extensive flexible API and support for

00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,000
protocols like al daven radius wicked

00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,850
works with any enterprise network

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,280

trial today regardless of whether you're

00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,800
considering two-factor authentication

00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,230
for the first time or just ready to

00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,510
ditch your existing expensive key fob

00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:00,670
system we can help with easy to

00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:04,620
implement easy to use strong

authentication from wicked

00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:15,750
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:17,910
way to better utilize all your resources

00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:21,360
and it makes managing all your resources

00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:25,190
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:28,710
happening in open source the

00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:30,510
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,610
of the community and the speed at which

00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,620
these are these you know these these

00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:36,930
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:39,510
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:42,240
that really shows the power of the you

00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:43,860
know of the open source community it is

00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,060
global and it's definitely because of

00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:54,390
the users community people are extremely

00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:56,280
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:58,590
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,290
guys helping each other out and they're

00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:03,000
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:05,990
the product is transparent for everyone

00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,940
everyone can look at the code base

00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:10,650
everyone can see how close darkest is

00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:16,530
being built nothing nothing is

00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:19,170
proprietary everything is open in many

00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:23,370
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:27,150
unborn health cloudstack the most

00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:31,060
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:33,700
was our first developer boot camp

00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:36,340
and our call gave people I gave me two

00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:40,300
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:44,470
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:47,320
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:49,840
chairs into the room twice everything

00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:53,080
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,170
is open source and so I don't think that

00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,910
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:00,940
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:03,670
computing and so i think it's i think

00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:05,020
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,130
about cloud computing you're really

00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:11,680
talking about open source cloud

00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:14,830
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,230
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:21,130
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:23,800
each data centers these hardware is

00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:27,280
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:30,010
to handle number one that mass scale

00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,160
number two it's designed to handle the

00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:36,040
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:40,240
deployments started working on cobb deck

00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:43,510
over four years ago and it was the

00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,280
original set of people working on it had

00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:49,390
a background of delivering software

00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:53,620
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:57,250
lots of users actually using it high

00:59:53,620 --> 01:00:00,310
availability is the key feature multiple

00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:02,500
hypervisors support different network

01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:05,500
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,270
better while step management server can

01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,960
be deployed in different physical

01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:12,610
machines it definitely has a huge

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,620
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:20,200
there's a major movie studio that they

01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:23,500
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,480
to transcode video and i thought that

01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,100
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,370
more fascinating is what they did during

01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:33,160
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:34,330
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,250
lunch was over they would this

01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:40,420
all the instances and go back to doing

01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:41,920
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,020
so many different aspects and there's no

01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,390
one person that's kind of like a master

01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:50,500
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:52,720
as a project is going to be one of the

01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:56,770
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:02,200
most feature fallen and and robust

01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:05,130
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,130
living through the clouds dag

01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,950
you

01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,380
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:30,329
ago we could not have imagined that

01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:32,550
asterisk would not only become the most

01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:34,680
widely adopted open source communication

01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,720
software on the planet but that it would

01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,240
impact the entire industry in the way

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,220
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,859
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:45,810
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:47,910
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,290
transition of power from the hands of

01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,569
the traditional proprietary phone

01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:53,970
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:56,040
administrators of phone systems using

01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,690
this power our customers have traded all

01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,760
sorts of business changing applications

01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:01,589
from small office phone systems to

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,690
mission-critical call centers the

01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:05,520
international carrier networks in fact

01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,960
there's even an entire country those

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,420
communications infrastructure runs on

01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,369
esters the gym has always been about

01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,079
creating technology that expands

01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:15,240
communications capabilities in ways that

01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,440
we could never have imagined and that's

01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,839
part of what's game-changing about

01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,510
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:23,609
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,740
IP phones that extends control of the

01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:27,480
user all the way to the desktop the

01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,190
launch of these new products represents

01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,200
the next phase indigenous history of

01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,690
innovation these are the first and only

01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,400
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,960
power of esters when we first discussed

01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,000
our expectations for building a family

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,160
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,900
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,520
the team to build the phones such that

01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,710
they were easy to install integrate

01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,569
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:51,119
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:52,770
that goal user feedback is validating

01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,869
that when it comes to operation with

01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:57,300
astro space systems including our own

01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:59,880
Switchvox based product these are the

01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,170
easiest to use best integrated most

01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,780
interoperable products on the market

01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:05,750
today the Digium family of phones will

01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,859
initially include three IP des hommes

01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,750
uniquely designed to complement any

01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:11,640
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,310
these phones are different for a number

01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,950
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:18,390
designed for use with esters secondly

01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,000
we've made it really easy to

01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:22,380
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,060
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,770
to access information inside of

01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:27,490
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:30,010
between an application and the

01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:32,170
all additionally we've created an

01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:34,270
applications engine that allows users

01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:37,510
and developers to create and run their

01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:39,280
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:41,230
done all of this at a very compelling

01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,910
price point at Digium we're always

01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:45,010
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:47,530
the best value in business phone systems

01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:49,150
and also give them the power to create

01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:51,280
their own solutions or any

01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:53,020
communications challenge well continue

01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,430
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:56,500
Astra's cooler faster and more

01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:58,240
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,790
asterisk and communications even easier

01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,990
and together we'll change the way the

01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:03,990
world communication again

01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,870
your customers rely on your website or

01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:18,240
application if it's slower

01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:21,150
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,010
and costs you money keeping your

01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:26,530
business critical systems humming along

01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:28,840
requires insight into what they're doing

01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:30,790
your system metrics tells stories

01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,800
stories that can reveal performance

01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:35,110
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,700
other problems but how do you keep an

01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:39,340
eye on all of your systems performance

01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:42,370
metrics in real-time and record this

01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:44,140
data for later analysis enter longview

01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:46,150
the new way to see what's really going

01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:48,310
on under the hood the long view

01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:50,380
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:52,810
of all your systems providing you with a

01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:56,200
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:58,780
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,580
load and network usage click a specific

01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,950
system to access its individual

01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:05,460
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:07,840
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,520
comprehensive network data including

01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,830
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,420
available on the network tab and disk

01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,310
rights and free space on the disk

01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,160
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:20,710
displays usage statistics for individual

01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,870
processes the system info tab shows

01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:25,120
listening services active connections

01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,250
and available updates adding long view

01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,960
to a system is easy just click the

01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:31,090
button copy the one line installation

01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,520
command then run the command on your

01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:35,230
linux system to complete the process the

01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,420
agent will begin collecting data and

01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:40,930
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:43,180
start rolling use long view to gain

01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:47,940
visibility into your servers so when

01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,940
