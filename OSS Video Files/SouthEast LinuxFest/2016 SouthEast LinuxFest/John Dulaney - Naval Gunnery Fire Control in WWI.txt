www.flexsim.com sir in 2016 for helping

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,710
make these videos possible and today I'm

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,130
going to talk about mechanical analog

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,480
particle computers used on ships or is

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,969
on battleships and power users as well

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:48,149
as the data transmission and works that

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:51,079
went along with them your project

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,899
contributor images I'm here specifically

00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,489
and Weddington terrible but I'm also a

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,489
longtime member of the dreadnought

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,219
project which is an open access naval

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:08,040
history project and you have a general

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:11,430
project and our goal is to make his

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,720
naval side of over one freely in a

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,900
freely accessible we have a lot of

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,790
memories of the Royal Navy yes that's

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,920
actually really the best documented of

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,830
all the major navies of over one I

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,829
personally focus on the austro-hungarian

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,710
Navy which is somewhat more difficult to

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,970
research a lot of adoption garyun navies

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,850
documents have been destroyed especially

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,619
in the low virtue and apparently someone

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,149
were able to talk cart block by the

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,079
Soviets and this is effective the German

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,430
Navy day includes me even more so

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,850
researching the Germany is questioning

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,380
difficult there's one man that

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:59,490
researches in US Navy the French

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,590
unfortunately have been somewhat ignored

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,640
several are we're looking for someone

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,130
like you at home

00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,350
and there are some wonder make these

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,000
involve it we would like researchers to

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:16,780
get involved so we're looking for all

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,830
there's at the moment so the basic

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,380
problem of governor e hiring flow is

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:28,090
living and a naval battle a hit

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:32,620
chocolate which was in May 31st of 1916

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:35,560
so just a few years ago now the ranges

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:41,290
were on average about 13 to 15 nautical

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:43,330
miles at that range the ship is just not

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,270
much larger than we'll floating on the

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,130
horizon and so you have to be able to

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,230
hit that using nothing but optical

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,610
sights great part not yet didn't Vince's

00:02:50,230 --> 00:03:00,520
and you're moving your target is moving

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:03,760
how do you do this so not not only is

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,840
your your target a tiny nozzle in

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,019
memorizing you also have the issue of

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,410
clouds weather smoke from your own guns

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,800
smoking your propulsion system any kind

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:23,140
of spray any kind of fog obscuring your

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:29,230
sight and so it becomes rather difficult

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:32,440
to hit your targets in their hands going

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,500
back to the American Civil War

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,739
you have the first fight between two

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,220
metal worships the USS Monitor and the

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,440
CSS Virginia and they were followed at

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,959
ranges of 100 yards and even a tech

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,670
range there wasn't a whole lot of

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,910
penetration of armor the guns are still

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:56,220
very short-range they fire the guns

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:59,980
fired black powder with propellers and a

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:03,910
lot of shooting the target and their

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,850
cannon ball bouncing off but since they

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,670
were in such short range you didn't have

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,460
the major problems you get it by World

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,270
War one you basically look

00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:22,120
you're John and see your targets and do

00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:25,300
something you're probably gonna hit so

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,730
that's like the tradition up to that

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,890
point the human where there was every

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,930
gun had a governor an officer that would

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,170
actually mainly aimed that individual

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,170
gun

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,870
well mostly should travel there's little

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,870
awkward for outside salaries

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,100
you know you had an officer standing in

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,010
today higher than we have every gun on

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,980
the broadside bargaining once as close

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:59,590
to it once it's humans can do it was

00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:04,450
just lovely man there's no picture

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:13,960
polarized photograph the monsters were

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:15,610
low rafters in the armory and the

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,690
monitor has the distinction of being the

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,690
first church at worship well they could

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,300
actually sit around and they didn't have

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:35,710
to use the entire shooting they could

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:39,550
just now Oh 30 years later you have the

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:42,990
spanish-american which is the additional

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,540
interest and seeking in the USS Maine

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:51,310
but one of the significant battles was

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:54,250
that Santiago big guns were still

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,950
relatively short range you will

00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,250
communicate the paddlers logic short

00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,350
range but the guns and souls are at that

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,450
point painful of significantly longer

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,800
ranges they just do not have a fire

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,800
control mechanisms in place

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:24,810
all right so hey so the guns at by this

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,319
point they convicted smokeless powder

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:33,120
which allow the guns have a much longer

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,979
range than the American Civil War but at

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,710
the same time they not get to the veget

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,960
effective centralized partner so

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:45,180
individual guns were still locally Hanes

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,000
and there were a few misses and the

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,810
battle oh that's better

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,860
and you have up something I'll go the US

00:06:51,810 --> 00:07:00,360
Navy had a mix of 8 inch and 12 inch

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,599
main guns on their battleships and they

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,960
reported a less than 20% kid great with

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:11,120
the 8 inch guns and the 12 inch guns

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,490
didn't get a single thing not that and

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,319
it was still fall and ranges just a

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,289
couple of miles much greater than the

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:26,009
Civil War yes but not the 14 nautical

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:29,490
miles of 20 years later and here we have

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:31,250
a picture one to ship that Santiago did

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,699
it or not that a couple of things here

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:38,219
there this of it that's all the mass you

00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,440
have here lookout positions and they'll

00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:45,810
have binoculars in such like right there

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,430
but well what I can observe here is the

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,740
lack of certain things that I'll point

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,710
out later pretty since there are no

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,000
brain Shriners but that helps you all

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,690
show you all the great Reiner is

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,370
learning all comes back to this image

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,530
but each of the guns here was

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:08,580
individually Eames and individual

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:11,430
acquired years after that you have the

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,639
Russian Air Japanese lorry and that's

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,770
where the Japanese fleets annihilated

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,250
the aggression in Pacific please and

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:24,690
then annihilated the Russian Baltic

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,910
Fleet and I am I like I mean they either

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,300
captured for some

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:32,630
pretty much the entire fleet by this

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,820
point the ranges were opening up even

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:39,440
more than the previous spanish-american

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,419
war ranges sending England's well the

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,600
Russians first like Empire at seventy

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:50,000
seven hundred yards Japanese movement

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:52,250
Quadra and about 75 million years the

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,990
pirate Lutheran's and Japanese was

00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:02,090
pretty decent we were a developed a 30%

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:04,340
hit rate for both sides however the

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,840
Japanese had better guns they could

00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,290
shoot faster and they have better

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,630
gunnery practice and so they they also

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,290
had settled tactical advantages to the

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,050
Russians

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,780
such as they crossed the Russians team

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:22,400
which is where we have two pleats

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:24,470
teaming at each other the plate that

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,800
crosses in front of the other plate and

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,750
there came with its entire bar outside

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,120
versus the complete that's getting

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,960
crossed only has their guns at the front

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,540
of the ship departed so the Japanese

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,490
ships had on average two to three times

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:46,160
as many got some student the Russian

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:49,640
ships and so the Russians suffered both

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,490
sides had rangefinders this would it

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,740
just didn't introduce the years of the

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,680
war the Russians only had a few the

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,420
Japanese fleet was only entirely quite

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,820
brutal

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:09,530
they both had British are in childhood

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:11,570
with 688 renders and he's allowed he's

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,210
allowed didn't the two fleets actually

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:18,950
fairly accurately determined the range

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:21,170
of each other and so that going to that

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:26,150
was somewhat healthy with the increase

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:28,460
in accuracy so here's a Japanese

00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,090
battleship over and you'll see circled

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,540
here in yellow

00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:37,680
he's too far looking things at for an

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,810
act the 41 is the main battery happiness

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,360
citing their battery these are the range

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:50,640
finders I mentioned we look at this we

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,670
don't have them and here we do in at

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,149
this point directory requiring which is

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,459
where who have centralized one person

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,370
will trigger in it and all the guns are

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,080
required by that was coming into use a

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:08,370
couple of the Japanese ships had it a

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:11,160
couple of Russian ships however this is

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,920
the extent of apartment in the Russian

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,040
Japanese there was no there's still a

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,100
lot of centralized making of guns there

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,000
is still manual calculating where are

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,990
you nuts

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,520
and so the ranges were both still

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,839
relatively short of what they would be

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,839
ten years later

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:38,190
okay so Brent right there an optical

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,399
instrument works on essentially the same

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,529
principle as a pair of binoculars when

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,500
you focus a curve binoculars haunted

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:49,830
objects at a certain range you can

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,080
actually use the angles of the focusing

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:56,240
mechanism in that American ocular to

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,890
determine the range hood and objects and

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,930
individual operation of the air broom

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,110
due to all kinds of actors from

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:08,279
vibration of the ship to smoke obscuring

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:10,640
your view factors such as that even

00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,500
fatigue of the range aligners operator

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,350
however you average sequencer them

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,459
together pretty accurate picture of how

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:23,940
far what your target is the long the

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:27,390
larger range hunter is the more accurate

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,190
the arrangement is because if you have

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,720
any longer distance between the two

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,510
lenses of the rangefinder

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,209
you get a better sort of various air

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:41,670
comes here your copy you have your

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:44,570
target there were two types in use the

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,570
coincidence rangefinder

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:56,710
and then no question sincerity and this

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,320
is a nice drawing of the range Rider

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:02,890
this is a full Rwandan version of the

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,690
barn shell crane charger this is very

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,810
similar to what does use it there are

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,480
some Japanese work and disappoints in a

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,330
later version this was these standards

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,750
grain trying to use by the British Royal

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:23,080
Navy they're more one four foot six inch

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:25,270
right leg length from one one of input

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,020
piece to the other groupies and the two

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,270
circles at the ends are your lenses and

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,570
you have if you find here in the middle

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:41,980
that's you know this is slowly even

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:44,140
operator can see through so the Baruchel

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,260
range riders were whatever known as

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,180
Quincy's range riders you have a single

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,020
image had like looking through the

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,630
telescope

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,050
and you have to have it splits

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,390
horizontally and so which the operator

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,850
would do would be to align and to have

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,339
that image and then there was a

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,890
mechanism within the range finder that

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,800
once you've got this jus has the image

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:13,990
alone will tell you how far away what

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,880
you're looking at us and here here's

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,510
what it would look like as you can see

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,800
that top part of the mast it's not quite

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:26,080
lined up with the rest of the mess and

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,180
this is a this image is actually

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:35,890
straight out of the bar in Ralph's

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:39,100
great manual the 1910 recommend the

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:42,220
there over one that Germans however use

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,740
the stereoscopic rangefinder

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,529
so this is more like looking through a

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,510
pair of binoculars and do a single

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,120
telescope

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:54,520
what did major difference in operation

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,440
of the state with the German rangefinder

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,040
like a pair of binoculars you would

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,890
adjust the

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,620
and once the image was that you were

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,269
looking at what's in focus the men

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,019
internal mechanism we didn't give you

00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:12,500
the range to the objects and the German

00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:15,079
manufacturer's likes may have heard of

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,980
in terms of manufacturing camera lenses

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,740
and oculars and such like today this was

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,880
how they got their start manufacturing

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:28,600
range tiny equipment for the German Navy

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,060
other users the building's the

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,680
austro-hungarians and the Russians use

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:41,779
something that very much they used to

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:46,430
the boring shop a notable event in 1906

00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:49,310
was launch of HMS dreadnought the main

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:53,709
apartment was all a single caliber they

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:57,320
were running arm it was all 12-inch guns

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:59,839
they this was one of the first major

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:04,630
ships to be built from the start with

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,459
centralized director firing so modeling

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:12,230
did all they're all the guns of the same

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:14,589
size which allowed by that

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,839
having a single size main armament

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:23,420
allows you to observe splashes around

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,430
your enemy and that lets you the problem

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,130
with the multiple size Arminius is that

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,449
a different size gun needed to be hired

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,140
at a different angle

00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:36,199
well here observing the thing is is that

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,300
advantage Jill doesn't make that much of

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,829
a difference in the splash and the 12

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,810
inch shell so if you're trying to

00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:44,149
observe a splashes and adjust your

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,920
acquiring and they look the same

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:49,000
you can't television from there firing

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,360
from so this simple life aiming in

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,959
simplified correcting grain the central

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,149
director fired all the guns at once

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,610
electronically

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:04,250
there was also an apparatus where the

00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:08,550
main memory officer had a periscope a

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:11,370
good point that at his courage and

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:13,620
it indicates what indicates and all the

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,200
turrets the angle that was pointing at

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,350
and then the turrets were all pointed

00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,360
exactly the same thing so that was

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,960
another major innovation that that was

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,910
coming around this time and the last

00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,040
major thing with the very anomalous it

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,070
was the worst battleship wind turbines

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,260
so it had a significant steam ferrocene

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:40,320
advantage over everybody helps very much

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,360
automation topic this the US Navy

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,300
started launching very little rocket

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,760
ships for instance but the biggest two

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,400
competitors were the Germans and the

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,270
British and this led to a naval arms

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,470
race between the two and they ultimately

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,470
culminated in the battle the gentlemen

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:10,770
so the idea that was keeping a range is

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,530
you know those s here you have your raw

00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:17,970
data from your rangefinders and from

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:21,330
spotters and we tried to have my head

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,890
what your target seat is and you can

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,100
happen you know what their bearing is

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,420
relative to you by pointing your

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,470
telescopes that they're the middle you

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:33,360
can read the very often them with

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,720
observation you can tell what your

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:42,000
targets heading is which is called

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,730
information and so and of course you

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,060
know your own sweet urinating and so

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:52,140
these are your basic inputs to great Eva

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:54,900
which in turn leads to your outputs that

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,040
are used to direct your guns my range

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:01,650
rate is the change in range between you

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,740
and your target the speed across is how

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,630
fast they are moving relative to you of

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,370
course ultimately you're ultimately

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,010
having relations our gun collection

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:14,190
which is where you turn left and right

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,850
and elevate you ship which is how far

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,850
away from you

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,540
you had this here great cheeping

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:28,830
instruments most babies had some form of

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:31,559
fire control table the basic premise is

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:34,970
is that this is a centralized place

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,320
where country calculations are done

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,059
different nations had different levels

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,780
of instruments to use on this fire

00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:45,270
control table and this almost a

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:50,100
conquering the gracious we have the most

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:52,760
information on them they incorporated

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,990
things like a lot of some sort fairly

00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:00,390
great solvers which tell you different

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:06,450
you know derivatives of the input data

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:09,179
and keep a virtual picture of the change

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,299
in your enemy's position relative to you

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,160
and things of that nature and they also

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:21,950
include data transmission quotes

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:24,240
receiving and transmitting the British

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,049
used what they called indirect fire

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:33,419
people table named after at the time

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:36,390
commander Dreier basically he designed a

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:40,380
system that incorporated several

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:44,220
elements - including do different cloth

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:48,540
aquatic systems various locks are

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:51,030
keeping range and as well as what was

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:55,320
all the numerous which was a mechanical

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:59,760
computer for calculating range and it

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:02,549
was a big heavy iron table well size of

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,230
we need two of these banquet tables

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:06,230
which he had they're side by side and

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:14,340
they were located in a central location

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,020
deep in the armor in partnership this

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,059
was some of your most valuable equipment

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:22,500
ownership so they wanted them well

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:26,130
protected then they had beta networks

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,790
coming in and going out large bundles of

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:35,620
cables the average British battleship

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:40,420
was 28:38 cable or 28 wire table writing

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:42,370
to each of the turrets plus another six

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:46,150
wire cable going to begin from each

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:50,950
rangefinder and telephone cables and

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,840
things of that nature and most babies

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,580
the location of this particle hitting

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,330
table was called the transmitting

00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:03,910
station the Germans in the u.s. single

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:08,890
same thing and it was what in a way this

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:11,710
is what evolved into the modern CMC and

00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:16,840
there's commander barrier as he was as

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:20,380
Admiral all right so this is a particle

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:24,190
on the right here we have the range

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:28,830
block and in the middle is the numerous

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,540
and on the left is bearing blood and

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,180
there's also who various engines that go

00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,550
along with this the major point of this

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,280
is showing the different officers

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:42,070
actually the different operators that

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:46,540
works in this as you can see it was

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:50,190
somewhat labor-intensive you had a

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:54,540
different person operating its input and

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,540
at the time they did not quite have

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,430
motors are strong enough to drive this

00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,200
equipment directly so they had what they

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:08,020
called it all of the bunker system

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,510
whereas you had a receiver from whatever

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:14,050
your data source was and had a twenty

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:17,560
lines and you had your own mechanical

00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,350
crank that you returned to put in your

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,240
input here and your yeah it was a little

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,070
plunger that you would try to keep lined

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,590
up with the point arrow from the

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:31,570
receiver so even though we had

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:34,180
electronic data transmission the going

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,190
from that electronic transmissions in

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,370
the mechanical input still required a

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:42,220
human operator and they trainings

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,140
literally for hours they had be able to

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,600
train just topology that one

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:52,720
line up they did a great job eviction

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:56,260
there's a 3d view of it and like sitting

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,680
in the middle here is numerous and that

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:03,040
was basically the core of the dreary

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,590
particle table it's a mechanical

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,350
computer then you take your various

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:13,110
inputs and it points to an outlet you

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:17,980
see the grid there on the right the

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:22,300
range watch yeah and there were

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:25,540
variations of this but the version that

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:29,320
was prevalent at Jutland I had

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,810
essentially two pencils and one was

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,240
automatically driven by a selectable

00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,670
range marker and you could actually sit

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,720
there and select range I know you wanted

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:43,090
to drive this and every time a range was

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:48,640
taken that rangefinder it would depend

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:51,460
with plot point and so the operator of

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,680
the plot table there which essentially

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,570
every time a new range coming from the

00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,210
range rider you would change that into

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:03,520
it and start following that it also the

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:07,450
other pencil over now was a red pencil

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:13,120
that took input from the correction

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:16,900
sliders so if they if they say observe

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,570
that the shells are falling say 300

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:23,230
yards over your targets they would relay

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:25,030
that to the plot operator and he would

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:30,910
input that correction and this

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:32,740
resolution dislike that and so you're

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:36,730
gonna routes that would then take these

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:42,010
two ranges in Germany and use that to

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:46,360
tell the turrets were dangerous and on

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:49,000
the Left the bearing plot is a single

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,700
line plot showing the rain the bearing

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,350
in continued basically a continuous

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,910
pairing of your

00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:00,870
me on the top you have the salt there

00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:04,090
are a range clock on the top left and

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:08,740
that gives a virtual model of the

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:11,230
enemies range so yeah it is and it has a

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,940
it's a conference ism that you can

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:17,500
quickly adjust so if you see that your

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,630
theoretical range is off you have to

00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,419
operator that would go in and adjust it

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,370
and it that's it's also a clockwork that

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,590
operator was also in charge of keeping

00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,570
it lumped it had a red telltale that

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,330
will pop up whenever the screens getting

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:38,710
to the and he was in their mind it up

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:41,679
real quickly on the right side of that

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:48,010
is the little of the small table there

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:49,690
indicates your own ship speed and or

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,730
stomach the bottom you also have a

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,190
compass while they come with your Peter

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,320
yes here in this iron thousand the shape

00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,809
of the companies is hard work but it's a

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,549
repeater of the ship's main compass so

00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:07,620
that your fire control officer has a

00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:14,500
good idea of where north it is so

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:17,700
relaxing it's at the sander determines

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:23,500
plotted on Polly six-inch light paper

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:25,690
and post juglans they realized it's a

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,030
head obstacle incoming branch on here

00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:32,049
data were spotted manually they found

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:35,409
that the signal automated single input

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:38,409
was not sufficient but they didn't quite

00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:40,929
develop the technology to have all the

00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,600
range finders including at one time so

00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:49,720
they switch fully manual input system

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:52,299
using any keyboard the second clock as I

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,000
mention was their waiters bring ears

00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:57,220
fathers who put in their corrections to

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,210
base input for that was nine o'clock I

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:04,990
mentioned this marine chalk up they make

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,279
on the top here in the left side so it

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,950
drove a

00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:13,299
essentially a mechanical spindle that

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:15,549
went down to a you see this little thing

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:19,749
on the right side of the range box with

00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:23,249
a little bow on it that could take the

00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:27,519
gear that would let you put in the

00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:29,649
manual spotting Corrections and so and

00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,090
then at that point it drove a pencil

00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:36,879
omelette and it just works the pencil

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:39,070
left right and the French clock kept

00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:44,889
grinding continues on that electric

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:47,580
drive why are great early so you also

00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:50,109
see down here towards the bottom of it a

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,749
movable wire grid that you could

00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,849
actually move over whatever point to the

00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:58,830
great Lovelace interesting scene and

00:28:54,849 --> 00:29:03,609
that would help you quickly line up and

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:05,049
visually see where things are going one

00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:07,299
of the late operations once they make

00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:12,789
that figure as you can see it's not very

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:14,769
large with the size of the paper the

00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:18,820
bearing block which is the lot on the

00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:21,369
far left side and it was much smaller it

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:26,559
plotted heir apparent American huge here

00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:30,489
enemy versus time and this allowed the

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:34,359
gunnery officer to quickly see where the

00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:37,659
guns were aiming and it would quickly

00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:40,299
let them see and change and the bearing

00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:44,049
and so he could actually include that in

00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:46,929
his operations so that the guns would

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,869
traverse and keep home target to be very

00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:52,809
high

00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:57,129
despite the 16 inch size it was actually

00:29:52,809 --> 00:30:00,940
too large this did you only have a

00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:03,669
single plot on it we did need the entire

00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:08,469
size later versions they were convinced

00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:10,960
amount to finish it wasn't really well

00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:14,409
integrated with anything else like her

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,599
own it was after a war on it was

00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:19,960
actually essentially made in part of the

00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:24,940
main range plot

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:28,990
and they tended to drift off to the side

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:32,440
and drink off the paper and I wouldn't

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:37,890
say purely wasn't the gears were slip

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:44,590
and it was just a design flaw lineage

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:46,150
1919 there like said Rick bodman the

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,700
depressed is the heart of the whole

00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:52,540
system this was the actual computation

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:59,050
device and it submitted by John

00:30:52,540 --> 00:31:01,990
depressed originally in 1904 and here

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:05,350
gives a pop on you so this bar over the

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:10,180
top was fixed and the grid can be

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:17,950
rotated around to match what your

00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:23,020
variables as you can see the grid on it

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:26,170
that the x coordinates if you will was

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,570
the elevation and the y coordinates

00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,330
what's the deflection previously

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,160
mentioned the arrow elevation is the

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,820
angle that you're raising your

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,110
constitute your deflection is your angle

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:46,510
left or right that you're aiming your

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:48,130
guns so you had this carriage that you

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,530
would move back and forth on this top

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:55,360
part and this top part measuring

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:58,930
carriage it's schemed and this mechanism

00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:02,620
would they do it given as inputs the

00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:04,930
wind in each direction you give it as

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,180
your enemies range range that I

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:10,420
mentioned the gradient change and how

00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:13,120
far away your enemy is you give them the

00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,970
bearing race the great change of their

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,460
variable and they would point to the

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:21,010
coordinates on the clock there

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:24,640
I say giving you the elevation and

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:27,310
depression if later versions would also

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,450
include things like correction for

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:35,340
horrible are reporting on Coriolis sorry

00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:38,370
so you could actually put in we get its

00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,940
Coriolis effect has an effect home

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,220
enough the drift of shells to the left

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,659
or right depending on the orange it

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,460
steady so if you're heading due east and

00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:52,830
firing to the north it's going to be

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,539
very significant but here heading due

00:32:52,830 --> 00:33:01,830
north and your buyer entities it's gonna

00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:03,929
be somewhat less so the last and

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:07,049
actually in some of its most important

00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:08,880
part was the range o'clock so this is

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:13,799
where you can kept a personal novel of

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,140
the range to your target after Dublin

00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,659
they were we need to the electric it's

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:22,890
become something constantly I'm going to

00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:25,070
eat them while it was some lighting and

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,960
a variable speed transmission

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:31,110
essentially a distant altering mission

00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,490
and one of the settings was the speed

00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:38,279
the well to set the speed of the

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:42,059
changing rates you would move the ball

00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:45,270
in and out and there was a little little

00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:49,130
a thumb screw that you turn to set the

00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:52,020
change in speed and it would didn't heat

00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:55,860
your other English was a starting range

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,799
and so you can quickly adjust one or the

00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:02,220
other and keeping good Herschel all of

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,779
the range near in thirties and I'd say

00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,380
this is the most important because this

00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:09,300
is the device that ultimately evolved

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,710
into the bargains older years of World

00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,339
War two the American War and are people

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,830
that can't happen

00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:22,710
over one a largely based on this device

00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:24,240
and here's a nice exploded view so at

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:29,070
the bottom here we have our clockwork

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:33,510
mechanism and then in the middle is our

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:36,300
dis wheel and to the right we have our

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:40,060
inputs to speed it's a little African we

00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,950
have our initial crane sitting in which

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,870
and the red telltale here at the top

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:50,429
when that became visible that means you

00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:53,110
actually rewind your clockwork

00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:56,110
and the dial at the top is also

00:34:53,110 --> 00:35:00,100
adjustable so help you if you need it

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:02,830
too quickly in battle change the grains

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,530
targets a huge it targets or if you

00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,180
decide that barrel it your great is

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,880
integrates and you need to quickly

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,760
change it you can just move the dial and

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:22,390
quickly they brought the change in that

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:24,690
range the spine corrector gear like it's

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,610
big it's right that I mentioned that

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:31,630
whatever you spot your shell slashes

00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:36,730
that would then you could use that to

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:39,310
cracks of the use like to quickly

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:45,430
correct the output from your range clock

00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:47,620
to your range block and the bearing

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,690
clock was reduced

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,660
just before gently and what's not

00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,460
included in the particle table just has

00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,400
to get this little quitting later

00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,530
burdens but work on the same basic

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,940
principle of the branch clock and that

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,810
it kept a commercial model of the

00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:08,320
bearings in your target but it was

00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:10,660
largely a convenience so that they

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,460
wouldn't have to it so the another house

00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,080
who didn't constantly have to be asking

00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,670
the bridge what is the parent for our

00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:21,910
target since that very rarely changed

00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,490
unless at least were significant amounts

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:29,440
of pine chips tended to stay on the same

00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:31,720
course and so this was a convenience for

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,120
that and then of course it the your area

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,740
change force when you change course that

00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,440
was looted model it was keeping out the

00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,030
window but you know at that point you

00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,270
would determine the new bearing and

00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:46,740
reset according to me and once he and

00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,740
you have a local reference

00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:54,290
so the David transmission and this is

00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:59,660
the part that who smokes seem to get a

00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:02,240
maze-like we've had analog networks you

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:05,180
know big bundles of Abel's running to

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,940
various parts of the ship transmitter

00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,490
station you had cable running from each

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,450
of the turrets and also G to the

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,450
secondary guns

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,850
you also had transmissions coming in

00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,530
from the abridge you have a transmission

00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:27,760
from essentially a speedometer inputs

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:30,980
and these all work on the same basic

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,870
principles and your goal there are two

00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,900
different methods there

00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:39,350
what about step by step this is

00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:42,410
essentially a stepper motor our June by

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,870
a rather common complicated commutator

00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,420
like device essentially a rotary switch

00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:51,590
if you will and then there is direct

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:55,070
acting which is what we'd now call the

00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:58,610
synchro you have to essentially AC

00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:02,090
looking AC motor looking devices and

00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:04,070
when you rotate one shaft the shaft on

00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:08,540
the other end of the circuit rotates the

00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:10,820
same amount and the the second type is

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:15,500
called the direct learning and we make

00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:17,960
it user of this type of 8,000 Marion Amy

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:25,310
and the issue with it was they required

00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:28,250
more data wines in the I said system I

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:31,520
had a problem if this one cable was

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:34,370
severed or one - severed it would

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,440
continue to mostly work except that it

00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:39,440
would then give you an invalid position

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,790
and so he would not be obvious that

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,440
alignment considered and so whoever was

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,860
at the other end of it would keep seeing

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,870
input and it was great the direct acting

00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,430
method if you severed a single line in

00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,490
the

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:59,730
mission table it would stop working

00:38:54,490 --> 00:39:05,559
immediately and so it was in me said

00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:07,869
there was a problem the direction

00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,690
working consist even was more prevalent

00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:13,359
after World War one to get the

00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:16,599
advantages of seeing it with work

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,270
immediately became obvious and by

00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:26,230
Goldberg Jew was standard especially in

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:28,059
the US Navy so what we have here as I

00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,829
mentioned we had director complicated

00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:32,589
commentators something at a transmission

00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:40,630
site and then the receivers were

00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:42,940
eccentric spectra motors so the two

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,700
major manufacturers of this equipment in

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:49,960
the world that by the type of over one

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:52,059
with Siemens and Martin Sorrell and what

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,380
was companies made essentially the same

00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:58,390
equipment in fact the Royal Navy

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,349
actually used those in the German Navy

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:04,540
would use my wool running the Germans

00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:07,030
settled on Siemens because that was

00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:10,660
their domestic manufacturing these

00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,760
settlers impart charlize of affairs but

00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,920
the presence of our operation of the

00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:19,440
same and as you can see it's this

00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,970
requires even the step by step mechanism

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,630
indicated here requires quite a few

00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:29,339
cables I mean each position requires its

00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:32,349
own line plus you need a return ground

00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:34,150
and oftentimes you even transmit power

00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:37,530
along with them just in case

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,530
political power available

00:40:40,410 --> 00:41:15,809
Oh a lot of so the question is have I

00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:19,920
seen in the over one movies and how

00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:23,369
accurate are they um I actually haven't

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,819
seen many there because there aren't

00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:30,240
many the only one I can think oh I'll

00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:35,519
pop my edges one about the path a little

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,670
bullet Gallipoli campaign and I honestly

00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:40,500
I'm not sure how accurate it is

00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,950
it's a wedding hand-painted and I'm

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:51,000
usually interested in the naval side my

00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:55,279
qualities there aren't any movie that

00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:00,150
nursie Oh during the Russian Japanese

00:41:55,279 --> 00:42:03,750
how did the accuracy improve as machines

00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:08,640
improved so questions how more accurate

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:11,460
better these the questions I liked more

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,829
much improvement in accuracy between the

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:19,049
level between the Russian Japanese world

00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:21,450
over one so my reference this Battle of

00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:27,089
Jutland because it was easing nificant

00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:29,460
naval engagements of over one and it

00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:32,910
actually directly demonstrates his most

00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,700
of the ships in both sides had this

00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:38,190
happily equipment award but not all of

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,900
them and the ones that did not have it

00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:44,369
had a balcony 20 percent lower accuracy

00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,400
so it was it was like racing at me an

00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:49,110
increase in thickness

00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:56,620
when you're talking 20 versus 40

00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:59,800
basically yes he tried to dry hot

00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:02,350
entails yes how do they manufacture

00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,910
where they custom-built free where

00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,790
they mass produce in some fashion

00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:09,060
oh so the question is how will the

00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:12,060
German park people in tables

00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:15,580
manufactured in with they were craftsmen

00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:19,540
and as far as I know this is watched

00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,520
rainy as I said they were they always

00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,660
used some variation of the same

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:31,780
equipment there were lady each ship had

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:37,840
its own custom installation so wait for

00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:41,380
instance HMS Queen Mary had basically

00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,480
what I showed you but HMS lion was

00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,010
missing it had a few details later I

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,380
believe that they had a different uh

00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:51,550
they did not have a bearing block for

00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:54,340
instance on HMS lion and so each ship

00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:56,920
was even within an individual class each

00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:00,370
ship was different in the insulation

00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,830
fitting house so us an operator we have

00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,260
to spend a lot of time that particular

00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:07,000
installation and if you went to another

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:25,000
vessel you would have to get to know

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:28,600
that so that started around 1917 in the

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:34,510
nerman Navy the Royal Navy and the US

00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:39,220
Navy didn't adopt agile after all as far

00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:42,730
as how many that how it affected things

00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:45,520
we can't really tell because it came

00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:48,220
after or anything significant Mabel

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,920
naval battles took place so there's no

00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:55,120
way to compare it to before that make

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:58,380
sense before the only mechanical little

00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,450
turret stabilization came to play the

00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,750
officers were trained to shoot on the

00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:05,910
ownership so that they spent a quite a

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,590
lot of time practicing shooting in the

00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,740
exact pension that the guns were

00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:13,860
pointing at exactly the right point so

00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,350
obviously you have human error but truck

00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:19,190
here Road training overcame that to

00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,190
significant degree

00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,920
correct

00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:30,960
doubling HMS earlier reported firing a

00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:55,080
half salvo every 15 seconds a

00:45:30,960 --> 00:46:00,030
householder being so lame based art

00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:02,520
jewelry was largely any claim based our

00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:05,030
jewelry was largely a solving problem by

00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:09,740
this point it's something that had been

00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:14,010
calculated for hundreds of years however

00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:16,640
the problems of shipboard gunnery added

00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:20,370
to that so significantly the dad day

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,460
drive a an entirely new mythology and so

00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:25,500
and when we were at Short ranges the

00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,780
Americans of war bring a punch card

00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,670
range it really wasn't that much of a

00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,220
problem but when you're at 14 nautical

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:35,850
miles you have multiple seconds of

00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:38,400
flight time and your target is that big

00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:41,790
on the horizon you know it didn't

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,100
becomes a significant issue and so

00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:46,770
wouldn't you had the ranges opening up

00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:51,090
that's when you also had the change in

00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:54,060
technology this ever take into account

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:56,430
Oh late size swellings

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,840
because you know with the side of the

00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:02,250
books lifted up you're 30 degrees off

00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,820
well that's what makes it where you're

00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:09,310
sitting on the gyroscopic jack

00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:12,190
the guns that didn't affect that a

00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:16,180
centralized aiming and ring keeping any

00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:19,770
that was overcome purely by training to

00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:23,020
the fire when the ship was exactly level

00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:26,920
they had vertices at slightly different

00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:54,000
methods that weekend but essentially we

00:47:26,920 --> 00:48:02,620
wait until the ship the ship is slow so

00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:07,210
the battle was and that happened 100

00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:09,690
years ago on May 31st so - we did happen

00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:13,870
it was the hundred anniversary

00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:18,940
you had approximately 250 ships to war

00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:21,130
and 25 of them were including three

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,680
British tabloids in wondering that

00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:25,510
Richard

00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:28,060
- of the British battle cruisers were

00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,160
essentially one-hit ko as if he were

00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:34,420
lying one of them blew up within the

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:38,290
first 30 minutes of life and within five

00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:40,560
minutes of actual firing at the German

00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,560
battlecruisers

00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:48,100
if I recall that was something like

00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:52,060
6,000 miles lost it was a pretty

00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:59,380
significant event British had a hunting

00:48:52,060 --> 00:49:02,170
50 ships the Germans had a hundred so

00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:04,580
the Germans and British both claimed

00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:07,880
victory

00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,880
[Music]

00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:14,350
like sit they lost three three capital

00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,360
ships to the Germans losing one half of

00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:20,710
ships and then there are some smaller

00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:22,780
ships on both sides are all the British

00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,760
ships they had this problem or if they

00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,510
got hit maturity blew up pretty much

00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:32,140
right away the Germans didn't so much

00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:35,830
have that problem the German ships were

00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:39,400
individually built better so they also

00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:41,260
had fewer of them and at the same time

00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,550
they're saying all that even though the

00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:48,670
Germans lost fewer ships they also did

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,740
not insult an athlete go up the fight

00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:54,520
again after that

00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:57,760
so strategically the British won you

00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:18,520
have to has easily stayed locked up in

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:22,150
Harbor some fight for veto and part of

00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,590
our submarine at the time that was a

00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,720
pretty significant technological

00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:28,350
achievement although it was also

00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,350
beginning

00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:48,450
and explain to the ocean that's partly

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:53,280
correct columns so anti-submarine

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:54,839
warfare would seem to Z most we're much

00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,210
the time in submarines or some tubes

00:50:54,839 --> 00:51:02,339
because they were often service I I mean

00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:05,010
later on when the Germans started

00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:08,730
unrestricted submarine warfare the

00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:11,670
techniques were involved much more and

00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,680
so the point where depth charges were

00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,180
invented hydrophones to find the

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,670
submarines during men didn't know that

00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:22,770
but they didn't quite players even

00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:28,670
enroll in the major thing matters well

00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:28,670
the later stages late 1917 new

00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:55,859
innovations in terms of largely agents

00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:57,839
that you solve during war were a lot of

00:51:55,859 --> 00:52:00,060
the innovations were prior to a little

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,190
and then again there was another way the

00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:05,130
medium the active over one using the

00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:22,790
experiences learned said or their

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:22,790
driving technology yes as that wasn't

00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,720
during other in 1917 Canadian British

00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,619
invention where they all didn't win

00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,200
numerous

00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:33,450
which is like the main difference of

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,900
just a smaller version that took his hit

00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:41,400
was your win this we took in this and

00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:43,890
with humidity and wooden speed narration

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,690
has a little bit and then you get at and

00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,650
put into the main universe whereas

00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:59,519
previously you

00:52:46,650 --> 00:53:04,710
in that instance this problem is about

00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:06,900
this time and at the same time one the

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,079
ships were largely kept in her work

00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:28,880
because appear submarines aircraft

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:29,999
carriers just over one and it was really

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,299
Fielding's

00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:36,690
and it was really a significant factor

00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:39,119
in one Madame Jose because I was the

00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:42,029
only major city in the world there were

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:45,539
a few smaller almost sweet little

00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:49,140
engagements but earlier more like the

00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:51,319
person's the pilot about remain calm the

00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:54,239
Battle of their own analysis neither one

00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:56,489
battle accordance was smaller ships

00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,970
versus smaller ships and that was the

00:53:56,489 --> 00:54:02,190
predominant story of emotion of the war

00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:04,650
and the slaughter ships did not have the

00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:07,470
centralized control that the larger

00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:11,359
capital ships did have this because of

00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,359
resources they were fitted with him yet

00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:21,349
so it was a it was a dominating factor

00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:21,349
for about 18 hours of a so we're long

00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:43,160
and I sickly alter the course of the

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,150
probably the biggest factor the naval

00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:51,310
type or one affecting that anything else

00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,310
was the German submarine happening

00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:07,920
[Applause]

00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,869
[Music]

00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:41,059
[Music]

00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:48,160
you

00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,420
[Music]

00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,280
when we're trying to name Google we

00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,530
actually went through thousands of the

00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,660
name of the company has now become its

00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:16,310
own verb in the dictionary let's go go

00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,920
looking google it the Google on the

00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:21,200
internet make simple letters on a plain

00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,060
white page being able to do searches in

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,320
any language about any country when

00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,570
you're putting in a question they'd

00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,340
finish your question before you have

00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:30,800
been working on organizing the world's

00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,960
information our goal is to digitize all

00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,420
the books say Google announced gmail

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,130
email for everyone for free Google is

00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,930
nothing the entire world to make it more

00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:41,360
accessible to people everywhere goal is

00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:42,800
jumping into the mobile market Android

00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,690
was built as an open platform for

00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,090
everyone to use and build on this is

00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:50,630
crow it's a faster safer browser for the

00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:54,050
open web Google is unveiling what they

00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:56,090
call the knowledge graph we needed to

00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:58,400
understand the world the way you and I

00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,030
do as objects and relationships between

00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,040
objects

00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:03,080
today Google's got another useful

00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,160
feature with Google map we are providing

00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,350
you with answers before you've even

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,150
asked but if my favorite cards is the

00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:12,500
one that shows traffic data for your

00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,320
commute to and from work think about how

00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,720
far Google is evolved from the 10

00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,940
bluelux

00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,410
we asked ourselves how can we assist you

00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,620
right when you need it

00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:26,360
ok Google call the Walker Art Center

00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,730
it's not just desktops phones and

00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,960
laptops anymore okay move it use it you

00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:32,660
have to open and then that opened

00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,480
double-knit it watches with displays car

00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:37,130
consoles with this way ok Google let's

00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,680
go to the aquarium

00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:41,839
how can we help you get things done it

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,509
curves few steps as possible okay cool

00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:46,730
ok ok Google show me my photos of Lucas

00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:50,150
with a pumpkin but we have to remember

00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:53,230
we have a long way to go this is just

00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,230
the tip of the iceberg

00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,720
