High Quality Audio and Video on a Budget

(Apologies for quality, OBS kicked our butts in '16.  Any spots where audio is silenced is deliberate to remove audio of our staff/volunteers troubleshooting during the presentation.  Our mic input failed over to a shotgun mic which was unfortunately at point blank for those discussions.)
