the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040

linux fest visit w wh linux pc org the

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,070
the following diamond sponsors in 2012

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,480
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,650
great fantastic all right i'm matthew

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,840
carnitine we're going to talk about

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,030
features a lot to get covered in were

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,850
already late so we'll just jump right

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,770
into it so well what is the feature and

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,980
the naming when they came up with this

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,320
is kind of a wacky to explain so when

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,850
you think about Drupal you know you want

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,070
to build a Drupal website you have

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,860
different features that are going to go

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,329
into that website a blog a calendar you

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,610
know how would I make that calendar I

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,920
download the events module the date

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,980
module I mean the calendar module the

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,230
date module I'd create an events content

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,650
type give it some fields at creative you

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,380
based on the calendar template you know

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,049
maybe add an image and create a image

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,820
cache preset maybe add created contacts

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,030
to show the mini calendar on the front

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,820
page and then show latest events on the

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,369
calendar page all of these steps go into

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,580
making this section of this website this

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,560
use case well what features does is that

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,189
lets you collect all of these different

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,560
components into a single reusable module

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,659
so the next time you need to make a

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,509
events calendar you don't have to do all

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,240
that stuff again you can just reinstall

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,490
this events calendar that you created on

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,860
the other side and so it's a collection

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,979
of drupal component components that come

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,920
together to satisfy a use case so what

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,960
can I put inside my features well all of

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,140
this stuff everything on the left-hand

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,610
side is what you can put in

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,189
out-of-the-box tone on features you can

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,090
start exporting this stuff no problem on

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,729
the right hand side our contributions to

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,429
the features module with system

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,679
variables we used stronger module I

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,569
don't really use blocks anymore I like

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,530
the boxes module because it has machine

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,400
names and

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,400
inline editing so I you know use the Box

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,410
module for exporting blocks and so forth

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,600
and so forth there's many many things

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,880
that can export the features and if

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,459
there's a module that has some sort of

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,590
object or data in the database that's

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,319
not exportable the features yet well

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,440
it's not terribly difficult to do it you

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,230
know you can extend the features API and

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,830
you know submit a patch or CTools has a

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,140
great API for adding support for

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,959
exporting features so features creates

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,519
these modules so how are these modules

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,900
any different than a regular drupal

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,500
module well there's three main

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,570
differences when you hit download on a

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,730
drupal feature from your features you I

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,230
it's generating code for you you're not

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,880
sitting down at a text editor and

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,730
handwriting this stuff it's going to

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,860
create it for you the functionality is

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,080
being collected to create a new module

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,390
versus i'm going to invent this new

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,950
module to do something new and then the

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,959
last thing is features are really easy

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,150
you know again back to our events

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,310
calendar if someone's new the drupal and

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,500
you know they have a very simple need an

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,540
events calendar they don't have to loan

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,610
out of the box how to do all these

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,920
different components and views and

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,530
content types and fields they can say oh

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,900
bob has an events calendar feature let

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,150
me download that I now have an events

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,220
calendar I can reverse engineer and see

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,890
how Bob did it and I can learn off of

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:46,709
that so new users aren't starting from

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:48,600
scratch so let's take a look about why

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,180
we should use features and there's

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,910
basically two main reasons we want to

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,859
use them the first reason is fast and

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,590
easy reuse of stuff you know i'm a

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,269
freelance developer so i'm making a lot

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,180
of the same websites over and over again

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,060
you know blogs events calendars lutz

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,940
feeds all that stuff i create features

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,590
of each use case so the next client i

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,290
get you know i don't have to build them

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,329
for this long development process and

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,769
design i can just turn on a feature and

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,440
then they could say yeah let's change

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,539
the colors in the ID areata and so stuff

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,940
gets done a lot faster you save so much

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,550
time in the long run the second use case

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,160
is for advanced deployment that's the

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,620
dead stay

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,900
each pod stuff what ken was talking

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,330
about in the keynote one of those

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,210
initiatives getting that configuration

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,280
that's in the database into the code so

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,100
we can migrate it between machines and

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,330
instances we'll talk tiny bits about

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,080
that at the end but we're going to

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,850
mainly focus on reusing these features

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,800
to save ourselves time and money in the

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:57,430
long run so let's go ahead and take a

00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:00,580
look at creating a future so let me do

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,190
this and how's that look as good as it's

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,740
going to get so let's take a look at

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,840
this I have an itch gallery feature here

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,720
on the left-hand side we have latest

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,880
images on the right-hand side a view of

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,400
all the galleries if we click on a

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,340
gallery will come in we'll see all of

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,310
those awesome images laid out using the

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:25,690
color box module so when you click on

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,610
them it'll pop open man you know nice

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,810
and pretty that was my summer vacation

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,450
last year so let's close this and we

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,870
will go ahead and take a look at how

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:47,580
this is all built and put together here

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:49,570
and so um once robotic me will get to it

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,130
all right let's see how this is put

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,750
together I like making image galleries

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,110
there's two content types the first ones

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,910
a gallery the second one is the image

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,200
images are put in galleries put you

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,390
straight forward here's the gallery

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,380
content type that's it just the basic

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,360
content type created no new fields

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,970
besides the title in the body here's my

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,280
image gallery I have an image field here

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,050
and then I've an entity reference field

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:20,050
so when you create an image you say put

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:22,390
it in this gallery we'll take a look at

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,160
the views my image gallery has two views

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,260
the first one is the gallery view which

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,390
just list all the gallery give me all

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,240
gallery content types created a menu

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,550
path for it nothing really fancy here

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,600
the second view are the images that

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:40,689
appear on to the gallery so when you

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,939
view an image i'm using the entity

00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:46,119
views attach module which is going to

00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:49,659
attach this view to an entity in this

00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:54,009
case the node entity of bundle gallery

00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:56,319
and so really fun little module EV a is

00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,959
the machine name for it and so this view

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,569
is given me all images I'm attaching it

00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,639
to the gallery and then my argument over

00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:08,439
here my contextual filter is saying only

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:12,639
grab images that have the gallery ID in

00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:20,889
the URL and so that's a simple little

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:23,529
view these are two separate views and

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:26,379
then my block view display on this view

00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:30,639
is showing the latest images i'm

00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:32,469
specifying only five items you know

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,499
nothing fancy show me the image and show

00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:39,099
me what gallery it's in and then next I

00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:41,219
have a context has anyone not used to

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,479
contacts module before raise your hand

00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:47,409
the context module lets you create

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:51,249
conditions and reactions and so I have a

00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:54,519
condition that says when I'm on the

00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:57,959
front page put this block in the left

00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:01,179
sidebar and so context module is huge

00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,149
basically from me replaces the core

00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:06,399
block system because you can get much

00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,259
more advanced block placements if this

00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,999
is happening if I'm on this page if I'm

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,599
viewing this node type if I'm on this

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:15,610
view if you yogli dokely do this and

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,349
there's a whole bunch of do this that's

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,839
involved so this context is pretty

00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,679
simple if I'm on the homepage put the

00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,149
latest image on the left hand side and

00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:28,569
so now I'm going to go ahead and create

00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:31,239
the feature and so if we once we turn on

00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:33,159
our features module we can get to it by

00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:36,129
going to our admin and clicking

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,469
structure and then features and that

00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,539
brings us to our features page here will

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,729
see a list of features that are

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,069
available if they're online if they're

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,259
not online the state of the feature and

00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:50,139
the actions we can do with them now

00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:52,899
features basically have three primary

00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:54,200
states they can be disabled they can be

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,510
enabled or

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,190
can be overridden if it's disabled

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,420
that's turned off if it's enabled that's

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,880
turned on the overridden state means

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,790
your feature has stuff in code but if

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,280
you go in and change the view change a

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,920
setting on the field anything that's

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,050
different than what's in the code then

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,820
that features now overweight and there's

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,890
stuff in the database that doesn't match

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,190
what's in the feature and we'll talk a

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,300
little bit more about that in a bit so

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,950
we're going to go in and create

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,040
ourselves the new feature right here for

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,540
this image gallery this is we're

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,520
basically creating a new drupal module

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,860
so we're going to give the basic info of

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,110
any other triple module we got to give

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,380
it a name will auto create a machine

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,080
name you can change that if you want to

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:46,010
we're going to give it a description of

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,750
the image gallery it is the best image

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,040
gallery ever I'm going to give it a

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:54,440
version number and then the URL of the

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,350
update XML is something we are going to

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,180
take a peek at a bit later basically

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,650
what it does is when you download a

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,960
module from Jupiter and then maybe a

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,490
month goes by and that module gets an

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,750
update when you go to your available

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,180
updates it says hey there's a new

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,310
version what we're saying is we're

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,900
telling it to look at this URL for new

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:19,430
versions if we leave a blank it will

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:22,220
default to drupal.org I think so anyway

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,230
let's take a look I clicked on the

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,910
components menu here and this is where

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,130
we're going to start to actually export

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,290
our stuff and we can see I have the

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,150
strong arm module turned on so I see

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,680
strong arm there and that's the only for

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:37,670
this demo custom module that custom

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,140
contributing here but all that other

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,180
stuff here is what we still in one of

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,550
those first slides that we can export

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,260
content types context appendices all

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,350
that fun stuff so we're going to start

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,000
at the top with content types and i'm

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,820
going to say let's download our gallery

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,400
module and then hocus-pocus abracadabra

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,190
Boosh what just happened there so what

00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,380
we did is we said i want to export the

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,990
gallery content type into this feature

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,090
and what features said is oh that's

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,770
really fine but if you're going to

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,730
export that module then you also

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,860
probably want to X

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,260
this field and you probably also want to

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,690
export all of these strong on variables

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,639
that are related to the gallery content

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,500
type and if you're downloading a content

00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,899
type then you're probably going to have

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,790
to depend on the node module and the

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,250
stronger module since we're doing all

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,320
these variables in the text module since

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,510
we'll get in this field and so features

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,570
is automatically detecting what it

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:37,519
thinks you also want to download which

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:40,389
is useful so we'll hit next and the next

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,760
thing we're going to do is grab our

00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:45,290
image gallery so we'll click on image

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,449
content type and it's going to grab all

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,850
the other fields and all the other

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:54,110
strong around variables next we'll

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,790
select our context what we use to set

00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:04,279
the block on the home page conditions

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:06,949
and reactions after short coffee break

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,040
we will select dependencies not we'll go

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:12,199
to views I guess we're going to select

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,750
that gallery view and our gallery image

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:17,810
views I could have made this one view

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,160
but for the demo I just picked two so

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,290
the next thing we're going to do is

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,660
download dependencies now you see I'm

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,120
using the color box module with my views

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,860
as a display for matter but features is

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,110
not that smart it knows that I need to

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,779
view but it doesn't know that it's using

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,550
color box so I want to add a dependency

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:38,569
the color box so my view doesn't break

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:41,899
on the new sites something else we see

00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,819
is that my entity views attach module

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,380
isn't being included either so I'm going

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:51,170
to go ahead and add a dependency that

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:54,980
that as well so image styles we don't

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:57,380
have any i'm not i'm using the core

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,560
image presets but that's where i select

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,920
them and our strong on variables is what

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,329
I like to get click happy here we have

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,639
all the variables in a Drupal site which

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,310
is a lot I mean it's redonkulous how

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,680
many there are so what I like to do they

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:19,310
make sure I don't miss anything is grab

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,370
everything related to these content

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,870
types this a few

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,089
different ways to create features you

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,650
know methods theories on what should go

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,230
in the feature some people like to

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,450
create a feature you know image gallery

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,430
content types image gallery views image

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,940
gallery permissions break it up across

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,650
10 features for the one image gallery

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,750
some people like to create features my

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,660
site and pack everything into it I like

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,690
to create features that are concentrated

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,630
use cases but everything related to that

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,760
feature goes into it content types

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,070
permissions views all of it goes into

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,660
that feature and nothing else you know

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,270
I'm not going to put event gallery stuff

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,670
into my image gallery feature if there's

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,529
something that you know maybe kind of

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,200
goes with both maybe I have a homepage

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:08,290
rotator that pulls content from news

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,640
events and galleries I wouldn't put any

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,620
of that stuff in any of those three

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,980
features I'd create its own feature that

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,410
would depend on those three features

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,210
nobody's really done bench much

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,970
benchmarks to see if having a million

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,880
features is any worse than having you

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,760
know one humongous feature you know if

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,620
anybody wants to go ahead so what I like

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,730
to do when strong arm since there's so

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,339
many variables is i'll use my browser

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,650
find and hit control find and typing

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:43,050
gallery my machine name and then I'll

00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:45,310
basically go through and click off

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,610
everything that's related to the gallery

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,959
content type now I'm pretty experienced

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,839
with features i've been using them for a

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,420
very long time so i know that i can

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,950
blindly go ahead and click things after

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,680
looking at them really fast if you knew

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,330
the features look at each variable and

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,610
make sure you actually want it in your

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,820
future there's certain variables you

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,650
don't want to export to your future

00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,420
things variables that may affect

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,950
multiple different things in drupal

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,589
again if there's one variable that

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,110
affects your events your images and

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:22,000
renews don't put that in your feature if

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:24,700
there's a variable that lives in a state

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,920
of existence not existence sometimes

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,779
it's there sometimes it's not you don't

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,150
want to mess with dynamic variables like

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,920
that so i'm going to go ahead and pause

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,930
this because it's getting ahead of me

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,730
so don't put features like that Oh

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,170
variables like that and your features

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,720
because it will break stuff in the long

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:47,970
run so I selected my variables and then

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,790
the last step I'm going to have here and

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,560
you will see in the gray items the blue

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,590
ones are what's been other detected gray

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,630
items or what's been you know selected

00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:01,290
by me I hit the download button and

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,880
here's my feature downloaded to my

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,450
desktop I'm now going to drag it over

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:12,960
into a brand new site that's using the

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:15,240
same modules as the original and so

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,100
here's this new site and I'm going to go

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,830
ahead and turn that features on feature

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,510
on now a thing that I drill in the

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,060
people whose features or modules modules

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:27,210
are not features but features of modules

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,820
so all of your features will appear on

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,800
the module page you can enable them on

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,200
the module page you can enable them on

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,630
the features page it doesn't matter I

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,840
tend to do it on the module page because

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,340
I like to see what the dependencies are

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,010
you know if there's any config custom

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,170
stuff going on so I'm going to select it

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,500
on this module page and hit save

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,970
configuration now this was a blank site

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,670
with nothing on it just modules turned

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,720
on a different theme and now that this

00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:00,900
feature is turned on let's go and clear

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,880
the cache now that this feature is

00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,550
turned on all of those views all of

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,100
those content types that context those

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,140
fields they've all been now created and

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,760
applied to this website so i don't have

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,380
to start from scratch with this new site

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:20,070
i have an image gallery out of a box and

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:22,230
so now if i look at the homepage here

00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,710
we'll see my gallery menu link that

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,710
wasn't there before

00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,500
but it's empty so let's go ahead and

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,090
generate some content and we'll make

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,559
sure that our feature is actually still

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,680
working and so I like to use the devel

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:47,410
module and the develop module when i'm

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,780
developing you know before i get content

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:56,290
from clients I'm just going to generate

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:58,240
blank dummy content to make sure stuff

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:10,440
is looking the way it's supposed to so I

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:12,580
will generate myself five galleries and

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:20,290
then i'll create myself a bunch of

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:23,020
images to go in the gallery and now if i

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,660
go to the galleries page after this

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,280
stuff is generated will now have a nice

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,280
full view of galleries

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,120
look at that isn't that amazing latest

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,999
images galleries all there all that work

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,820
done but looking at this we see it looks

00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:51,289
much different not much different but a

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,600
bit different than what we started out

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:57,230
with all these images on the front page

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,659
facing view but they weren't over here

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,450
on this view so what's up with that well

00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:05,570
the problem is there's a variable where

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,450
that data is stored called field bundle

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,399
settings and the problem with that

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,009
variable is it holds the display

00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,269
settings for all of your content type so

00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:16,730
that's one of those variables that

00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,009
affects a lot of stuff that we don't

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,049
want to put in our feature so we'll just

00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,320
come over here and hide it for teaser

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:26,990
views and then we'll be back to normal

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,200
it's really annoying and all that stuff

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:33,080
should obviously being its own variable

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,919
and now that we have a fixed here we're

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,840
good to go so stuff like that we

00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,809
remember that this is just a drupal

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,679
module so anything that you can do in a

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:48,019
regular module you can do in your

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,149
features module so if you need to do

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,539
stuff that couldn't be exported but an

00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:56,240
install hook to do all that stuff you

00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:58,899
know upon completion so split field

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,320
bundle setting is obviously an issue

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:05,210
it's up on drupal.org they I think at

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,230
this point it's been fixed it's been

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,730
tested and it's been rolled out for a

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,100
latest version of Drupal 7 so I don't

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,950
even think this is an issue anymore but

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,450
it's just a great example of why you

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,820
should pay attention to the variables

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,759
and how it can affect what you're doing

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,860
so that is how to create a feature it's

00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,740
pretty straightforward we're going to

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,350
put on our imagination caps and think

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,450
about how we can use this in our lives

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,360
this works for everybody whether you're

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:38,299
an individual freelancer like myself or

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,330
big you know company like meteor current

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:44,240
that has huge clients you know we're

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,789
going to create features reusable stuff

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,129
spend our time on it put it into it and

00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,809
then we're done you know the next time a

00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,260
client says hey I need a big image

00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,000
gallery

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,340
I don't have to spend the however many

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,320
hours to build out all this stuff I can

00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,390
turn it on and have it ready for them

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,070
and then they can either spend time on

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,340
making a little better making it unique

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,140
or poof it's just dumb done and they say

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,280
hey wow you know that was great and fast

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:13,100
and we love you here's more money so

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,870
next features our modules anything you

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,420
could do in a module you can do in your

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,250
feature and so we're going to see a

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:25,370
little demo here on how we can add

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:27,200
custom code to our feature so let's take

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,580
a look at this so here's my image

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,670
gallery on my purple site now and I

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:37,280
think what I want to do is two things

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:38,810
the first thing I want to do is all

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,790
those images right there that's really

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,560
ugly I need to apply some CSS to that

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,930
they make it look pretty when I make

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,300
features i like to have them look good

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,000
out of the box you know a lot of modules

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,880
that have UI elements to them they come

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,520
with some basic CSS to make it look good

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,060
and then you can you know override that

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,880
CSS as you want I do the same thing with

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,970
my features I add generic CSS where

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,370
maybe I don't need to change it and if

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,070
my FEMA wants to he can the other thing

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,400
I want to add is how cool would it be is

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:16,610
if I'm looking at the image gallery and

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,230
there's a link that says add image and

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,940
they click the link and it opens in a

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,530
modal with the image node form and they

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,010
can add the image and hit save and it

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:27,290
just Ajax's the image gallery and proof

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,700
it's all there Ajax and magic so that's

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,500
what we're going to do I think that'd be

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,440
awesome so let's take a look at our

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,410
feature module as it is before we mess

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,840
with it like any module we see we have

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,820
our dot module file and then we have a

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,020
bunch of include files and do you want

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,450
to move over some that you know okay so

00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,300
we have our dot module file our dot info

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,370
file like every drupal module does and

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,950
then we have these five other modules

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,440
which are the includes so if we look at

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,430
our info file put you straight forward

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,730
this stuff at the top but then

00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,920
everything below are all the X portables

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,400
and features reads this to see what is

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,290
in the

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,390
chair and so if we look at our dot

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,700
module file that's it it's just saying

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,370
hey include all this feature stuff over

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,410
here and then if we look at our includes

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,360
now this is where features magic is

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,000
happening now all features is really

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,470
doing in some cases is implementing

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,960
Drupal hooks you know here it's

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,710
implementing hook note info to create

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,840
those content types so it's not crazy

00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:35,090
voodoo magic just a little bit of magic

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:37,130
so when you're editing these modules we

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:41,660
want to remember that that includes

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:44,690
stuff is code that's generated from from

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,190
features and that anything with the dot

00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,290
include you probably don't want to mess

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,140
with unless you're a features guru and

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,450
know what you're doing the dot module

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,550
file the dot info file yeah add stuff to

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,370
that all you want so that's what we're

00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:01,370
going to do I copied over a CSS file an

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,680
info file and install file we're going

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:06,440
to ignore and a module file a new module

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:10,600
file and we will see what changes I've

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:14,360
made so if we look at our open these up

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:17,170
we will start with our info file all

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,320
i've done here is down at the bottom

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:24,400
added CSS in Drupal 6 I would it down

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,230
the hook in it to include Drupal at CSS

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,190
there's my awesome CSS file obviously

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:33,980
I'm a developer so here is my dot module

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,860
file now we at the top we still have our

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,480
include image gallery da features ink

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,980
you don't again you don't want to mess

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,290
with that or else your futures is going

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,060
to break but everything below the sky is

00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,760
the limit you can do whatever you want

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:49,190
and so I have added a few hooks here I

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:53,210
created a menu path for my see tools i

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:55,160
created a hook node view to add the link

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,380
and then my menu path call back in a

00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,320
form altar and so you know I think there

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,990
was like 50 lines of code here don't

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,000
mess with the dot include seriously and

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,500
so let's go ahead and see what this

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,110
looks like I've added the code let's

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,520
clear the cache and we will see some

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,670
magic the first thing we're going to

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,010
notice is our CSS being applied I'm just

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,750
floating that stuff again I I pay

00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,170
designer to do all that kind stuff

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,390
so pretty straightforward and now we

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,430
have a new link at the bottom add new

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,890
image so I'm going to go ahead and click

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,640
on that but first I'm going to change

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:33,560
users so I'm not user one and so I click

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,290
on it and now I'm in the sea tools modal

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,090
let's go ahead there's me Disney World

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:44,060
that was actually my vacation last

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:46,220
summer the gallery is already

00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,820
pre-selected so I'm going to hit save

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,350
and now poof I'm a jack seeing that

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,590
image right there into the view and

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:57,880
there it is and so it's a great example

00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:00,890
about how you can take a basic feature

00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,020
again semantics are getting me a use

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,150
case our galleries that we've exported

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,760
with features and add your own custom

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,440
code to it to make it even better so now

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,720
when you're shipping this image gallery

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,940
or reusing it you're including all your

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,440
custom stuff that's going to make it

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,110
special because we all want to be

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,850
special so that's adding custom code to

00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,410
features features of modules and if you

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,710
do with module you could do with a

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:27,380
feature and I highly encourage it so

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,630
organizing and share so we have these

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,600
features what do we want to do with them

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:35,630
they are rigidly created kind of have

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,340
this decentralized approach where you

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,100
know I'm fantastic with my image

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,920
galleries and my blogs bob is fantastic

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,100
with his real estate feature Tommy knows

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,080
how to do the news and the you know

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,640
events calendar features we all have

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,530
these features and we're sharing them

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,440
with each other like we would upload

00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,670
them to drupal.org there's a few

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,800
different ways we can share these

00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,140
features the first one is featured

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,300
servers which are kind of antiquated and

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,650
nobody really uses them anymore we'll

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,500
still kind of take a look at a quick

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,240
demo real quick to see if you like it

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,100
you can use it feature server is

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,440
basically a dumbed down version of the

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,510
project module let you create projects

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,510
and releases and make it available for

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,250
other people the link into and download

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:22,100
you know this is a module you can upload

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,900
it to Drupal github com if you want and

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,130
make it available there tell people

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,080
you're developing this awesome feature

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:31,640
yada yada yada but really now drupal.org

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,370
originally features

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,980
you know I don't want to say shunned but

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,570
didn't they weren't accepted much on

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,460
drupal.org because they weren't real

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,050
modules they would just feature modules

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,200
and we didn't want to pollute the module

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,580
sphere with these you know we didn't

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,550
want a thousand blog features on

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,710
drupal.org as projects but now since the

00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,810
great get migration anybody in there

00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,300
cousin Kree can create a get sandbox you

00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,740
know I think I have like 13 sandboxes so

00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,140
create a feature and if you think it's

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,330
remotely useful for someone else slap it

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,370
in the sandbox you know at the beginning

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:07,580
of the year I created a very small

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:11,210
module that length views and web form

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:16,550
selects together so you select component

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:17,960
on views could be fed from a ish like

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,630
component and web form could be fed from

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,610
a view you know I think it was 30 lines

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,770
of codes 50 lines of code slapped it up

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,330
in the sandbox I don't even work on the

00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,790
project I riginal II made it for any

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,220
more within a month I had like 13 people

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,350
patching it and working on it was like

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,020
oh okay so put your stuff up on

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,780
drupal.org sandboxes you know people

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:41,030
will definitely help on it if it's

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:45,380
useful on maybe one day it'll be a real

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:49,400
module so we're going to look at feature

00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:52,220
servers just a little bit again nobody

00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,860
really uses I'm a whole lot now but it's

00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,290
a pretty great example for what we're

00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,560
doing next so here's my feature server

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,240
I've installed locally I got no projects

00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,780
or distributions so I'm going to create

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,300
content we see feature server creates a

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,000
distribution a project and a release

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,500
force I'm going to create a new project

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,590
call it my image gallery fill out all

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,180
that same information about the feature

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:20,480
one weird paradox thing about a feature

00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:25,580
servers the feature server is actually a

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,580
feature so it's another example it's a

00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:31,040
feature server that you know basically

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,840
its features are great is a Kickstarter

00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,850
for developers you know you don't want

00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,580
to hand code that entity stuff for that

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,320
node stuff so you just start it with a

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,610
feature and then add your custom code to

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,500
that there's nothing wrong with it and

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,240
so that's what feature service does it's

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,020
a feature and then a bunch of custom

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,210
code

00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,330
that does all this and so i created my

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:54,260
image gallery project some information

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,910
if if i wanted to add you know the

00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,100
project status you are well they say

00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:01,010
come look at my future server for

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,350
updates and that's one nice draw about

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,540
the feature server is as you release new

00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,610
updates to your feature server if other

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,350
people are using your features or even

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,420
in your own sites you'll be notified

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,850
saying hey your feature server has a new

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,050
version you should go get it so I'm

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,090
going to create a new release here I

00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:20,540
selected my tower file I'm going to

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,900
select my project select the version the

00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:27,020
patch number you know if I wanted to

00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:31,610
type alpha dev you know whatever you

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:35,180
could add that there extraversion stuff

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,800
is what it was above we'll skip that

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,080
here you can select if this is

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,400
recommended or security release that

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,620
ties into again the update status if

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,170
it's just a recommended you update

00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,910
status will say hey there's a new

00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,050
version over here if its security with

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,450
Lisa to say hey there's a new version

00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:56,410
over there go get it and so here it is

00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:00,620
we now have a download link available

00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:03,290
and if we go back to the project that we

00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:08,000
added this to will now see it looks very

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:11,180
similar to the drupal org projects page

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,210
where we have releases you know the

00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,460
package the version yadda yadda yadda

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,680
and we can look at my release notes and

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,650
there it is and so it's pretty

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,540
straightforward you know if this is how

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,540
your company once organized your

00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:29,960
features that's fine I put all of my

00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:33,980
features in a my own get server so

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:38,240
that's just how I do it and that is a

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:43,300
feature server so Josh who has never

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:47,060
used rush before are you on windows

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:50,600
thank God it's a linux fest you know so

00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:55,070
Josh we love Josh so let's go ahead and

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,730
take a look dress can do a bunch of

00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,730
stuff for us

00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:11,760
rude sometimes oh there we go so josh

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,040
josh is fantastic for those of you have

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,990
that don't use it that much or don't

00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,710
know what it is it's a command line tool

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:23,130
for drupal that lets you do a bunch of

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:26,220
stuff from the command line and so here

00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:31,410
is just a quick little sampling about

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:33,540
what josh can do we will scroll up here

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,410
a bunch of course stuff creating

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:41,309
archives course status search stuff site

00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:44,669
installs aliases variable stuff the

00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:46,500
watchdog stuff but the best part is rush

00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:48,059
and this is where I use it and I think a

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,370
lot of people ninety-nine percent of the

00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,679
time use is the project manager commands

00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,000
when you need a new module without Josh

00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,990
what do you do yeah go drupal.org

00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,049
download tao ball unzip it of ftp it all

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:04,500
up or ssh it all up because nobody uses

00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:06,600
ftp because it's insecure with josh Josh

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,240
download this module it's done you want

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,070
five modules drush download vuze CTools

00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,549
yadda yadda yadda yadda enter it's done

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:17,490
so josh is fantastic schrock is going to

00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,070
talk about it in the next session so i

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:23,640
highly encourage you to go see that as

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,169
part of his distributions so drush is

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,270
pretty fantastic i'm not going to go

00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:31,140
into it there's plenty of tutorials and

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,240
stuff online on the Drupal dojo i did a

00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,480
webcast on how to install josh from

00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,960
pretty much any UNIX machine shared

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,510
server VPS so definitely check that out

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,419
and so my favorite powdered rush though

00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:49,400
is drush make and what Rush make does is

00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:56,160
it basically lets you create a make file

00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:57,870
or a recipe for your entire site in a

00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,600
single text file that you can execute

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:03,630
with trush and rush will go out and get

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,760
all that stuff for you and create

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:09,030
yourself a Drupal site so let's go ahead

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,649
and take a look at drush make in action

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:14,569
and what we're going to

00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:17,129
is we're going to recreate our site that

00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:20,309
we've been working now there's nothing

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:22,799
in this directory nothing up my sleeves

00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:26,220
because I'm not wearing anything so I'm

00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:27,960
going to run just make me that make and

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,669
what I think I should probably do is

00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:58,260
show you what a make file looks like

00:34:29,669 --> 00:35:01,559
first it's pretty simple I'm saying

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,680
we're working with Drupal 7 the API

00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:08,609
version is 24 drush make go get me

00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:12,059
Drupal go get me these modules go get me

00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:15,059
the color box library from color

00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:17,549
powercom color box scholarship and put

00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:20,039
it in the color box directory in the

00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:23,339
library's directory and then I'm saying

00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:25,710
go get me my image gallery feature from

00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:27,990
my feature server at future server local

00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,970
that f server just that's just

00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,190
scratching the surface of josh make and

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:34,130
i can show you more later if you enter

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,990
this kind of thing or mark will show you

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,089
Josh can get you specific versions of

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,490
modules it can put them in specific

00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,950
places for you drush will check out

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,789
modules from any type of moment any type

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:49,950
get subversion bizarre CSV it'll check

00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:52,349
it out from version control for you it

00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,359
will go get a patch and apply it to the

00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:58,200
module for you so if you like to live on

00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,000
the edge we can do that and so it can do

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,490
pretty much anything it can make you a

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,640
sandwich so let's go ahead and take a

00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:08,309
look so what I'm going to do is in this

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,940
empty directory nothing there i'm going

00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:13,260
to say drush make my make file and then

00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,680
i'm going to add a command that says

00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,450
prepare install what that does is it

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,880
copies the settings now PHP file over

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,400
and gets all that it basically prepares

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,390
it for install like it says so I'm going

00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,160
to run this

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,319
do you want to make a new site here well

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,630
of course I do and so what it's going to

00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,670
do here is its reading the make file to

00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,859
make sure that understands you want the

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,440
date module the date modules over there

00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,569
I got it if you can't find anything a

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,029
module it's going to ever out and say

00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:44,279
well I had some issues so after it's

00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:47,099
done inspecting everything it's now

00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:50,400
downloading stuff so we saw joopa loaded

00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,289
from drupal.org ftp drupal.org image

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,720
gallery downloaded from feature serve it

00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:59,279
out local all these modules downloaded

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:02,190
from all these different sites and when

00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:06,150
it was done we now have a Drupal site

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:09,809
all downloaded ready to go and so let's

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:13,740
take a look at what we got here if i

00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:15,299
refresh my page here i am on install so

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,400
let's go ahead and quickly install this

00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:19,920
and while that's installing will put on

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,829
a magic app so what we're trying to do

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,359
here is save time save money make things

00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:27,539
easier on us because I don't know about

00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:30,420
you I'm really really lazy and so with

00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:33,299
Josh make I can go from having nothing

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:37,079
to having my personal platform with my

00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:40,710
personal features all ready to go within

00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:44,339
minutes so I'm installing the site here

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:50,519
Josh make my username my top secret

00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:54,589
password its password turn off that

00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:56,880
update stuff save it visit my new site

00:37:54,589 --> 00:38:00,059
fantastic so the first thing I'm going

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,500
to do when I visit my new site is well

00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,180
let's see what I do I'm going to head to

00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,400
the modules page because I want to turn

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,589
on my image gallery feature and all the

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,079
other features that I created so let's

00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:12,509
go over the modules and we'll scroll

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,839
down we'll see all the modules that have

00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:19,769
been downloaded yes this was recorded at

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,630
drupalcon so here's my image gallery I'm

00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:23,220
going to hit save to that do you want to

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,150
turn on all this other stuff yes I want

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,150
to turn on all this other stuff

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:41,099
and now I go to features or my there's

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,710
my gallery menu and then we can use our

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:48,380
imagination create content types so it's

00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:51,720
really fantastic we've gone from nothing

00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,400
to a whole site in a matter of minutes

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,130
and so that's one of the great great

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,339
great features of features you know

00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,809
reusing this stuff over and over again

00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:02,160
so you're saving time and if you're a

00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:03,359
freelancer and you still want to build

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,700
that time of your client that's up to

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:10,950
you so that's pretty much a synopsis of

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,900
using features to reuse stuff over and

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:15,299
over again it's a fantastic tool I

00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,279
highly encourage you to use it here's

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:20,460
another use case for features which is

00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:21,930
less used by the smaller companies but

00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,589
sometimes required by the bigger

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:27,569
companies you know deployment local dev

00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:29,880
stage prod when you have huge huge

00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:33,210
companies big humongous website

00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,710
contracts websites can't go down which

00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,599
means you can't just be editing on

00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:39,619
production for these humongous contracts

00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,670
so the what we do is we break up the

00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:44,089
development process in the multiple

00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,920
stages I'm going to work on a feature

00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:48,480
component on the website here and then

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,089
I'm going to push all those changes up

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,680
to the dev server and then the rest of

00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:54,450
the development team pushes their stuff

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,950
up on the dev server and then we all

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,140
work together and make sure all of our

00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,579
stuff works together and once that looks

00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,529
good we're going to push all of that

00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,119
stuff to the staging server and then the

00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:05,369
client comes in and says oh yeah that

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,829
looks great we love it and then we push

00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:10,440
it to the production server in a strict

00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:13,619
environment nothing happens on prod

00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,680
stage and Dev except cast all work that

00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:19,319
gets done happens on local so how does

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,109
features fit into this well it goes

00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:26,010
something like this i download i upload

00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:27,420
my image gallery feature and it gets all

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,130
the way the staging and the client says

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,369
well we don't like that grid on the view

00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,510
can we make it a list and we say sure so

00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:37,140
i'm going to go back to my local

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,599
development and i'm going to change the

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,210
view and now my view is in an overweight

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,369
in state because my view does not match

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,109
which is in what's in the code

00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:49,499
so I'm going to go to Josh now and i'm

00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:51,569
going to say Josh fu Josh feature update

00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:54,779
my feature and what that's going to do

00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:57,089
is take the overrides and write them to

00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:59,160
the code and now that that those

00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:01,559
overrides are in the code now that the

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,839
features in the code i can use get to

00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,849
commit it and push it on up and now they

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,730
have their list instead of their grid

00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:09,990
and so the workflow is pretty simple

00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,720
we're going to create our features

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,039
locally commit them to get then we're

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,150
going to come to our dev server and pull

00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:20,400
them up or pull to the staging they say

00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,349
the let's change this let's change that

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,259
yada yada yada we come back to our local

00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:27,180
we make the changes we do Josh fu

00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:29,910
everything's written the code we're back

00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,619
a step to commit it push it up and so

00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,440
it's this big circle of we're pushing

00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,890
our code up the system and pulling

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,809
database changes down so if you want to

00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,660
know more about that we can chat later

00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:45,569
on I don't know if Mark is going to be

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,910
talking about that but Zach after lunch

00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:50,190
we'll be talking about agar and

00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:52,589
continuous integration and this is a

00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,869
decent part of that so I highly

00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:56,549
encourage you and I love how they set up

00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,009
the sessions it works out fantastic

00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:01,160
learn about features here go to marks

00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:03,119
necks and learn about the next steps of

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,400
distributions and such and then learn

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,079
how to pull it all together with Zach so

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,410
safely over adding features I don't know

00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:14,130
when this is supposed to end what time

00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:16,829
hmm 14 minutes fantastic alright so

00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,960
safely over adding features does anyone

00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:21,480
use like open atrium open public stuff

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,309
like that so all these big companies are

00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,619
creating these big distributions and

00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:27,420
they're all based and features and

00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:30,150
they're fantastic and they're beautiful

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,279
but you don't just download it and then

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,809
say this website's done I can go home

00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:35,430
you know you're going to make changes to

00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:36,809
the views you're going to tweak some

00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:40,140
things you're going to change things

00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:42,480
over here that puts your features and

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,559
overweight and state and you really

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,869
don't want your features to be

00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,700
overridden because it means stuff is

00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:53,190
unstable so if I download version one of

00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,259
you know open public and then I make

00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,239
changes when they come out with version

00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:58,170
two if I try and download that it's

00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:59,880
going to overwrite

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,100
all of my changes that I've made in the

00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,770
database and so we don't want to do that

00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,920
so what we want to do is save our

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:10,710
overrides off to the side so we can

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,470
still maintain the core feature without

00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,260
deleting our overrides and the way we do

00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:18,810
that is with the features override

00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:21,150
module and I'm not going to go into that

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:24,780
its features underscore override on

00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:27,270
drupal.org and what that lets you do is

00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,680
and it sort of works with Drupal 6 and I

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,960
think it's finally working good in

00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,990
Drupal 7 there was a great release the

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,630
week before drupalcon you make your

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,310
overrides from your distribution and

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,370
then what you'll do is you'll create a

00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:45,090
new feature and export those overrides

00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:47,340
to code and now you have your overrides

00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,380
in the feature and your cool feature in

00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,000
a feature and you can update the cool

00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,610
feature without affecting your overrides

00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,290
and it's fantastic and if you want to if

00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,940
you're interested in the underlying part

00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:59,760
of it you know think about features is

00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:03,030
implementing hook node info to create

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,130
that note info stuff where features over

00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,560
wide is implementing the older hooks and

00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,510
so your feature gets implemented then

00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,580
the ulta hooks alter it and so it's

00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:14,190
pretty neat I'm fairly sure it's working

00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,310
decently stable right now and it's a

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,400
fantastic tool so what have I forgotten

00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:23,820
another great features tool is features

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,200
tools module it's f tools is the machine

00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:32,670
name and that module does two things one

00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,890
of them is I use well you back to the

00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,200
development process we're making changes

00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,900
in overriding our features and we want

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,370
to light them the code if you got people

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,680
if you're not comfortable in the command

00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,570
line or something like that instead of

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,790
having that we create that feature with

00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,980
the new stuff and then we upload it if

00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,750
you set the permissions on those

00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,690
features to be writable by the server

00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,910
then features tools adds a new button

00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,270
that says auto create feature to the

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,920
weekly features button page so when you

00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,680
click the auto create features it

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,360
basically ones drush a few but its own

00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,050
version of it and we creates a feature

00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,400
in place and code the same way drush a

00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,730
few does but it's not on the command

00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,340
line

00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:18,150
so that's a cool tool that I use

00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,369
sometimes and another one is if you want

00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:23,250
to take something out of a feature maybe

00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:25,590
you create a feature over here but you

00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,660
only want some of that on this site so

00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,760
you can create the feature and bring it

00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:34,230
over here and feature tools has an

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,880
unlink feature and I don't haven't

00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:39,000
really used it that much from what I

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,520
understand is you'll do the we create

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,550
and when you unselect things you're

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,700
going to click the safe we create button

00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,440
and what it will do is it will remove

00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,950
that stuff on the feature but it will

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,040
create an export file that you can then

00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:58,260
grab and put through the UI which will

00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,460
recreate those exported stuff so it's

00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,950
out of the feature but back in the

00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,660
database I haven't used it that much I

00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,710
don't know if it works but I know it's

00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:10,320
out there so where do we go from here we

00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:14,340
created our features we added custom

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:17,100
code to it we created a make file so we

00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,290
have own little mini distribution and

00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,390
then I ran the make file and that was

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:25,050
pretty much where we ended there's a lot

00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:28,080
more you can do you know I had to

00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:31,260
manually go turn those features on Ida

00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,320
manually go select a theme well the next

00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,310
step is to create yourself a

00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,800
installation profile that does all that

00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:39,750
for you your install profile is going to

00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,609
say you know turn all of these features

00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,900
on maybe you create a UI where you

00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:45,000
select the features when you're

00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,550
installing it you know a lot a very

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,830
similar to how some of the install

00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:53,310
profiles distributions work out there

00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:56,280
today you know there's the apps module

00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,840
and app servers you know if anybody

00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,690
doesn't know what an app is that thinks

00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:05,190
it's crazy raise your hand you guys are

00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:08,640
awesome so apps basically add a stupid

00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:11,340
user interface to features features are

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,890
great and easy for users but they're

00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,869
easy for users like us you know you add

00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:18,720
a marketing person off the street that's

00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:20,369
used to wordpress prettiness to turn on

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,140
you know you say well you got to install

00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:23,550
Drupal then you got to turn on you know

00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,109
go to the modules page we go to features

00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,560
page to turn this on this on this on

00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:28,350
what

00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,220
apps does it creates eye candy on top of

00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:34,770
this interface and so your apps are

00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,930
basically again like any other module or

00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,820
feature but what it has that the others

00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,980
don't is an app manifest in the app

00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:44,820
manifest defines basically the

00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:48,960
dependencies of that app and so it looks

00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:51,090
into the core Drupal 7 update API so

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:56,100
when you say turn on my image gallery

00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:59,010
app if I don't have views on the site it

00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,860
will tie into that API and download vuze

00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:04,290
for you and so it's a nice pretty

00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,410
interface and there's a lot of strides

00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:10,230
going there for reviews and you know

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,330
comments and stuff like that and I think

00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,550
it's pretty much the direction that

00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,260
distributions are heading mark will

00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:20,070
probably know talk a lot more about that

00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:24,050
then I will and app server is true so

00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:24,050
that's it any questions

00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:41,310
mm-hmm so so the question is how does

00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:44,760
features handle conflicts naming

00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:46,170
conflicts for example i manually created

00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,150
the content type on this site called

00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,100
image on the score gallery and now i

00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,890
just put this module on the side that's

00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,840
called image on the school gallery if i

00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,810
go to the features page it won't let me

00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:00,870
turn that module on it'll say those are

00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,880
conflict if you export the same thing in

00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,800
the two features you know one from this

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,630
site and one from that site it'll say

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,330
hey this is conflicting with that

00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:12,740
feature you know we can't turn this on

00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:16,710
for you if it happens by accident

00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,140
somehow which it can happen stuff gets

00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,930
committed to code while two features are

00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,610
already turned on and it's you know it

00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:26,370
will say it's conflicted but it's turned

00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:28,860
on thinking this will happen on the be

00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:32,940
honest I'm I don't horribly know what

00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:35,550
the overall effects would be um it's

00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,930
decently smart enough I don't think if

00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:39,450
you go to the modules page it'll be

00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,340
disabled you know you'll turn it on and

00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:47,220
you'll side will explode so that'll be a

00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:50,340
good key yeah well and so so that there

00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,810
is a unique name thing there is a

00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,900
standard out there called the kit

00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:56,640
standard I don't know if it's actually

00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,890
widely being used i read it and said wow

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,140
that's great advice then moved on but it

00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:03,720
basically addresses subjects on how on

00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,850
you know we want to be able to reuse

00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,980
this stuff when i create a feature an

00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,560
appt my app should be able to work in

00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,170
media currents distributions as well as

00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,230
phase two distributions you know we want

00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:18,600
it to be able to move around and so part

00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:22,950
of that is namespacing you know maybe I

00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:25,470
call my image gallery MC on the score

00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:28,920
image gallery Matthew Connerton you know

00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:32,790
and anything you know no types maybe

00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,460
context views I don't think fields would

00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:38,160
be much of an issue you know I haven't

00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:41,090
spent a lot of time testing conflicts i

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,090
think i should do that next

00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:55,960
the problem we have features was you

00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,940
know they would go in and immediately

00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,950
override every single site in this

00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,620
shared code base and so what we've tried

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:05,050
to do then was to disconnect features

00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:07,510
and leave everything like it was and so

00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,100
I wondered if there was any plans for it

00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:11,050
to be actually part of a module to say

00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,220
okay I've deployed it and now I want to

00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:15,100
disconnect because we had to go in the

00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,720
database and you know still make it work

00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,700
that way so I didn't know if there were

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,900
more people that wanted that kind of

00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,480
functionality is pretty much like it

00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,640
almost like feeds but like an export and

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,690
deployed but it doesn't depend on this

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,720
module being enabled on a lot of that

00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:34,270
depends on the component itself if you

00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,190
have a feature that that creates a

00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,840
content type and then you turn off the

00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:45,910
feature that content type is still there

00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:47,700
it's not deleted if you have yes and

00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:51,040
then but there's others so that

00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:53,350
depending on how the content is stored

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,690
you know some content is happy to live

00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:58,300
in the database and that's what it's

00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:00,040
bold from some content is happy

00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,140
components are happy to live in the code

00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,660
and it can be pulled directly from the

00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:07,690
code CTools does a lot of integration of

00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,850
stuff like that you know the answer your

00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:11,170
question I don't know if what kind of

00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:13,300
tools are going to be added the features

00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,580
I'd say look at the issue queue that

00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,850
whole pulling stuff out of features is

00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,070
definitely a complaint features tools

00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:23,230
that module tied to address that with

00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,850
the unlinking functionality but I don't

00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:26,680
know if it's going into court should I

00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,090
check the issue queue and if it doesn't

00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,130
there say hey let's add this

00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,130
functionality and see what happens

00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:42,940
how would you copy a feature and just

00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:45,249
take pieces of that feature and then we

00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,140
create your own for example the cod

00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:49,720
distribution if I like the presenter

00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:53,470
piece of the feature but it's dependent

00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,150
dependent on the cod based feature how

00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,569
could I you know take pieces from

00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:03,240
different features and create my own

00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:06,970
gotra um well the way I would do it is

00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,920
I'd go right into the code copy the

00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,390
feature over and just start deleting I

00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,799
don't need that you know I don't need

00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,660
any of these permissions I don't need

00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:16,210
this and just delete it out of there

00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,400
because i have used features enough and

00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:22,269
have been in the features generated code

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:25,150
it's not difficult to learn you know you

00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:27,430
just don't want to break if you follow

00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:29,589
their pre defined structure you can mess

00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,960
with it all you want and so that's what

00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:33,759
I do I often when I'm doing cleanup of

00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,009
sites you know that's what I do as a

00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:37,690
freelancer sometimes has come in to big

00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:39,700
sites and clean them up you know I have

00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,890
to combine features what features apart

00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:45,549
and I just do it right at the code level

00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:48,549
so that's one way to do it is doing it

00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:50,980
in the UI if I create a feature and say

00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:53,170
this content type is in this feature and

00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,819
then I go to create another feature that

00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:58,089
content type is not in the list anymore

00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:59,739
and so you know we're back to you want

00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:02,019
to get that stuff back into the database

00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:04,720
so you can export it into a new feature

00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:07,809
so I'd say check out that features tools

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,400
on link feature of that and how many

00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:14,049
times have I said features in this

00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:17,019
presentation semantics really and so I

00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:18,670
would check that out and that those are

00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:20,499
your two options try and unlink it to

00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,480
the database and then create a new

00:54:20,499 --> 00:54:27,759
feature from it or just do it in the

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:31,150
code did you have a question anybody

00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:32,319
questions okay fantastic if you do have

00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,809
questions and you're just shy please

00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:38,049
come up and ask me I'll be here all day

00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:40,660
and the after party please go to marks

00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:42,609
if your inch to this workflow mark

00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,079
session is next about creating your own

00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:50,580
distributions and it will be fantastic

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:53,080
than after lunch zach is doing a girl

00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,390
continuous integration with Jenkins I

00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,520
think and all that good stuff so that is

00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,820
the next logical step after mark so

00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,820
thank you

00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:10,480
prospects I every way this is the way to

00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:12,400
better utilize all your resources and it

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,460
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:20,320
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:23,710
in open source the collaborative nature

00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,350
and of the you know of the community and

00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:28,240
the speed at which these are these you

00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,310
know these these deficiencies these bugs

00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,680
are getting discovered and then fixed is

00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:35,980
it I think that really shows the power

00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,930
of the of the open source community it

00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,130
is global and it's definitely because of

00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:48,460
the users community people are extremely

00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:50,230
friendly and always ready to help if you

00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,660
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,800
these guys helping each other out and

00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:56,680
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,510
manner the product is transparent for

00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:02,710
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:04,750
base everyone can see how close duck is

00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:10,600
being built nothing nothing is

00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:13,270
proprietary everything is open in many

00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:17,470
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:21,220
unborn health I'll stack the most

00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:25,100
exciting event in recent memory for he

00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:27,770
was our first developer boot camp

00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,410
and our call gave people I maybe two

00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:34,280
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:38,570
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:41,390
up with 87 people and had to go get more

00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:43,940
chairs in the room twice everything

00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:47,270
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:50,240
is open source and so I don't think that

00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:52,010
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,040
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:57,740
computing and so i think it's i think

00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,090
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,230
about cloud computing you're really

00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:05,780
talking about open source cloud

00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:08,810
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,940
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:15,200
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:17,900
in each data centers these hardware is

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:21,380
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:24,080
to handle number one that mass scale

00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:27,260
number two it's designed to handle the

00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:29,780
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:34,310
deployments we started working on cog

00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:37,610
deck over four years ago and it was the

00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:39,350
original set of people working on it had

00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:43,460
a background of delivering software

00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:47,690
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:51,320
lots of users actually using it high

00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:54,410
availability is the key feature multiple

00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:56,570
hypervisors support different network

00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:59,570
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:01,340
better while step management server can

00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:05,030
be deployed in different physical

00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:06,710
machines it definitely has a huge

00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:11,690
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:14,270
there's a major movie studio that they

00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:17,450
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:19,550
to transcode video and i thought that

00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:21,200
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:24,470
more fascinating is what they did during

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:27,260
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:28,410
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,240
lunch was over they would

00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:34,380
all the instances and go back to doing

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,000
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,100
so many different aspects and there's no

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,470
one person that's kind of like a master

00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:44,580
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:46,800
as a project is going to be one of the

00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:50,850
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:56,280
most feature fallen and and robust

00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:59,210
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,210
living through the clouds dag

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,060
you

00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,180
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:24,430
ago we could not have imagined that

00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:26,620
asterisk would not only become the most

00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:28,750
widely adopted open source communication

00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,790
software on the planet but that it would

00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:33,310
impact the entire industry in the way

00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:35,290
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:37,930
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:39,880
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:41,950
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,390
transition of power from the hands of

00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,640
the traditional proprietary phone

00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,040
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,990
administrators of phone systems using

00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,220
this power our customers have created

00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:53,170
all sorts of business changing

00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,000
applications from small office phone

00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:57,520
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,140
the international carrier networks in

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,910
fact there's even an entire country

00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:03,310
those communications infrastructure runs

01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:05,440
on esters the gym has always been about

01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:07,150
creating technology that expands

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,310
communications capabilities in ways that

01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,510
we could never have imagined and that's

01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:12,910
part of what's game-changing about

01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:15,610
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,710
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:19,810
IP phones that extends control of the

01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:21,580
user all the way to the desktop the

01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:23,290
launch of these new products represents

01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,390
the next phase indigenous history of

01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:27,790
innovation these are the first and only

01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:29,500
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,030
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,070
our expectations for building a family

01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:35,230
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,970
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:38,620
the team to build the phones such that

01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:40,810
they were easy to install integrate

01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,640
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:45,220
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,840
that goal user feedback is validating

01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,970
that when it comes to operation with

01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,370
astro space systems including our own

01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:53,950
Switchvox based product these are the

01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:55,270
easiest to use best integrated most

01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,850
interoperable products on the market

01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:59,850
today the digitally phones will

01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:01,900
initially include three IP des hommes

01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:03,850
uniquely designed to complement any

01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,710
asterisk or switch box based solution

01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:08,380
these phones are different for a number

01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:11,020
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:12,460
designed for use with esters secondly

01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:14,070
we've made it really easy to

01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,480
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:18,550
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,120
to access information inside of asterisk

01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,090
allowing tight coupling

01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,080
between an application and the phone

01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:26,240
additionally we've created an

01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,370
applications engine that allows users

01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,950
and developers to create and run their

01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:33,020
own apps on the following and finally

01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,060
we've done all of this at a very

01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:36,770
compelling price point at digium we're

01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,540
always thinking of ways to give our

01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:40,910
customers the best value in business

01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,860
phone systems and also give them the

01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:44,960
power to create their own solutions or

01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,760
any communications challenge well

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,500
continue to push the boundaries not only

01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,540
to make Astra's cooler faster and more

01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,190
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,650
asterisk and what communications even

01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:58,150
easier and together we'll change the way

01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:58,150
