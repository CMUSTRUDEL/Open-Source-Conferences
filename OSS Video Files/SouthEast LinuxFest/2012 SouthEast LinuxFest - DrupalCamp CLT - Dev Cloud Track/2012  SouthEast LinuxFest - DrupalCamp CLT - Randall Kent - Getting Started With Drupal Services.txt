00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,560
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,500
possible alrighty so um hello my name is

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
Randall Kent today we're going to talk

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,660
about getting started with Drupal

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,280
services so a little bit about me I'm an

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,100
Atlanta native born raised educated

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,370
everything Atlanta all within like the

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,950
metro area too so I've been drooling

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,620
since Drupal four-point something I've

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,230
forgotten the something through all the

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,199
Drupal cons I've been to but that's okay

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,760
it's uh it's been a good time and when

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,859
I'm not drew Polly I'm the father of a

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,409
puppy I enjoy gardening and I enjoy

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,700
doing philanthropic type things and

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,610
really every sense of the word so a

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,010
little bit of context or whatever about

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,360
what we're doing in this session or

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,729
whatever we're going to talk about the

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,430
basics of rest installing and

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,630
configuring the services module as well

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:28,320
as managing the nodes via rest api and

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,290
so if we consider drupal services this

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,020
iceberg here we're going to be right

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,400
about there on the very top so we're

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,500
just going to scrape the surface because

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,780
dribble services is really powerful you

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,520
can do a lot with it and this is kind of

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,250
just to whet your whistle get you

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,649
excited and go out and try try something

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:52,170
with it so we all know drupal has lots

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,460
of cool stuff you know you've got nodes

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,710
you've got users you've got the ability

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,240
to create a lot of this within a GUI you

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,250
don't have to write code to do some of

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,030
this and then these terms that I've used

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,740
here are specific to the services module

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,090
which we'll get into that's why I might

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,970
kind of look a little weird or whatnot

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,500
but so you've got all this stuff within

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,230
the Drupal box

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,190
and maybe you know you're a third party

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,480
and you want to use some of that stuff

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,120
but you're not you're not a part of the

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,770
site or you're a third party that maybe

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,380
wants to feed you information or get

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,800
information from you and do stuff with

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,940
it well that's kind of where the

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,410
services module comes in and the I guess

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,380
they're kind of three letters that are

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,470
very important in making that happen and

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,330
that is going to be API so api's

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,709
application programming interface or

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,010
whatnot and in the context the web

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:53,610
you've got web services web api i guess

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:57,330
there are some common terms and with

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,310
regard to the web and kind of what

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,200
exists out there you've got you know a

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:08,520
rest xmlrpc and soap soap i hope goes

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,790
away xmlrpc I could see going away and

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,760
be happy with but rest is in my opinion

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,610
kind of where it's at so that's why this

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,690
talk is going to go into a rest and then

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:27,720
how how to how to use it so quick

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:29,910
overview about rest it's built on HTTP

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,459
which kind of ties to the bottom one

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,060
uniform interface but just work with me

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,850
here so it's built on top of HTTP the

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,110
gentleman that kind of is the father of

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:47,489
rest is very involved in writing kind of

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:51,120
the standards that are around HTTP 1.0

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:55,380
1.1 and so it's kind of it sits on top

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,160
of that so you have kind of a

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,660
client-server or rather will explain how

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,200
it sits on top of it so you have a

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:08,790
resource which would be a URL so you'd

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,370
call ww-well com / something that's

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,049
going to be your resource and with that

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,510
resource you interact with it with a

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,090
method so you've got the gist get post

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,070
put and delete our kind of how you're

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,280
going to interface with it so if you've

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,110
got a get that is essentially what

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,990
happens when you type it in the URL bar

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,120
and you hit enter your

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,500
get HTTP requests and you're getting

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,560
back typically HTML that's then rendered

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,259
by by your browser so a post often done

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,580
by a forum and that kind of lets you

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,620
send some information to the server that

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,039
it needs to do something with maybe

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,310
create a new something and then put is

00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,110
similar to post but not so much it's in

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,380
the context of Drupal services it's used

00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,949
to update and then delete I think we

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,710
know what that one does so there is a

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:07,909
client-server model that's sort of

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,819
inherent in in rest and what that does

00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:13,430
is that separates sort of the data

00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,740
storage from the user interface so

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,960
you've got your data storage which in

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,610
the context of this talk would be

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,819
everything that's in your Drupal

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,620
installation or whatever and then your

00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,270
user interface or whatnot would then be

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,150
the client so you can kind of interface

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,550
so that however you want what's cool

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,039
about it is it allows evolution so

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,360
you're exposing your data to something

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,580
else and you don't know what's going to

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,039
happen with it and oftentimes a lot of

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,139
cool stuff happens with it so it's kind

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,289
of the client-server idea stateless

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,930
means that there there aren't there's no

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:50,180
state there's no session and this is

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,919
where drupal services rest server

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:59,060
becomes not restful because if you have

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,580
to authenticate in order to do something

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,080
it sends you back your little session

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,360
cookie and you're supposed to send that

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,740
back each time but well we'll go ahead

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,750
and you know just work with it because

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,840
you can have a rest like without having

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,370
completely restful and that's most api's

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,039
that are out there that call themselves

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,819
REST API is our rest rest like not

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,889
necessarily necessarily restful

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:24,080
cacheable that means that since it runs

00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,759
on HTTP anything you use to cash a

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,099
website or whatever can be used to cash

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,219
whatever is going to be returned by your

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:37,760
API so this really helps improve some of

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:39,320
the bad things about a REST API because

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,460
there's a lot of overhead it's stateless

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,660
so you have to send all

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,600
the information that's necessary to

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,389
process that request to the API have it

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,479
do its work send it back and there's a

00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:52,639
lot of overhead with that but caching

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,349
can help on the flip side it can also

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,990
hurt you because if you have stale data

00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:59,599
then you know everybody is familiar with

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:03,710
that sort of a trouble but it's I

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,960
consider it to be a pro to rest Laird is

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,120
another sort of aspect of a REST API

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,539
what this means is that you can have

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,340
your client called to what it thinks as

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,240
a server and then have that server

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,919
actually be a client requesting to

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,680
another server so you can kind of like

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:25,039
layer it like that and since it's it's

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,259
it how do you say I guess it's

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,699
transparent to the end user so if you're

00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,930
pulling a bit of information and in

00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,120
order for that server to get that

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,530
information in whatever it needs it

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,060
might call somewhere else pull that

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,400
information back and then spit

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,050
everything back to you and then uniform

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:46,210
interface kind of goes back to the idea

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:49,340
of it's built on HTTP so you're I guess

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,289
you you gain a lot from that so when

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,120
you're making a call to the API you

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,789
might get back an error code or rather a

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,190
response code 200 saying okay and that

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,520
just means that all right what you asked

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:05,479
to happen did happen you might get back

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,930
you know 403 or a 406 or the different

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,849
HTTP error codes are sort of what give

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,469
you a response or tell you what's going

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:20,150
on within the within the API so that's

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:22,849
kind of a very brief overview of rest as

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:27,139
a whole are there any questions about

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:30,139
rest who has anybody here use the rest

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:36,579
api before a restful api what did you

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:36,579
use it for just curious okay

00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:45,319
no just a REST API with anything Twitter

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:48,829
yeah yeah so all kinds of theirs api's

00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:50,269
out there for everything so anyway um so

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:52,240
we talked about rest we're going to show

00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,829
how to kind of get everything set up and

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,309
I'm going to walk through that really

00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:00,980
step by step and I had planned on using

00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:03,740
kind of a remote environment for this

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,230
but the Internet's just not not been

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,470
very cool so I'm going to use maybe a

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,300
local environment for that and I was

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,009
also going to have a piece of the

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,889
presentation where you guys could go on

00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,230
and essentially take or create your own

00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,240
HTML form if you had a laptop and submit

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,649
to it and have it go to the API but I

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
don't think that's going to happen we'll

00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,559
see so anyway we'll kind of dive right

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,559
into the demo

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,260
and if anybody has any questions as I'm

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,260
going along just stop me and ask because

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,220
that's what it's about

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:09,410
alright so just pop open a not that pop

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,540
up a little terminal window no make it

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,700
bigger so you guys can hopefully see and

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,740
I I have like some bash scripts that I

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,780
use that kind of just help me get things

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,280
up and running real quick so that's

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:25,910
things like adding a virtual host and

00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,950
kind of setting up the hosts entry so

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,200
that it knows that that's going to that

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:35,980
that should be routed back to to the

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,980
Machine and vert

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,110
and that's fine because I just cleaned

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,699
up my web group before I did this and

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,690
hopefully Apache restarted without an

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:06,980
issue so we can find out just by kind of

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:09,389
browsing to it yep okay so we're good

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,709
Apaches up and running the next thing

00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:13,920
that we're going to need is obviously a

00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:16,259
database and again this is not necessary

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,269
relevant to what we're doing but it just

00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:23,100
is showing you kind of how to get going

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:29,220
from square one this is another script

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:34,170
that just creates a database or it

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:37,069
doesn't we'll just pretend like it did

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,069
see what happens

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:58,620
he's dress to download Drupal and again

00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:01,620
I hope is this that this works is

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,620
internet

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:16,850
okay so what I would typically do is

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:20,240
used rush to download Drupal and then

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,279
use drush to install Drupal using the

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,959
site install command drush is amazing I

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,730
think there's a session after this if

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,949
you're not familiar with it please like

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,160
check it out because it's phenomenal how

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:35,990
much time it can save you and then once

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,970
Drupal is installed I okay we're just

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,559
going to jump ahead because I don't

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:55,490
think it's worth everybody's time to

00:12:39,559 --> 00:13:00,339
wait on that okay so this is the install

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,339
I did earlier and so what I did is

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,439
created a basic content type called

00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,910
contact to kind of give you a little

00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,100
frame of reference of how I found myself

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,749
using Drupal services we had a client

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:17,420
that wanted to have a bunch of different

00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:19,550
providers third parties design landing

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,829
pages and run advertising campaigns to

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,929
get people to drive people to these to

00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:26,480
these landing pages and they wanted to

00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:31,059
kind of aggregate all of the responses

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,230
and aggregating them in spreadsheets

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:36,170
really wasn't wasn't what they were

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,740
looking for so what we did is we're

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,910
obviously we hooked up with Drupal

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,389
services and that kind of made it easy

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,449
because we actually abstracted it one

00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:48,889
layer 2 which is what I did here as well

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:51,139
so that they don't have to know anything

00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:53,990
about Drupal credentials or anything so

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:56,360
they just call an API send they post

00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:00,579
some data it parses it sends it to

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,079
Drupal and then you can see it so anyway

00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,730
well look at the you know just the

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:09,589
content type that I set up real quick

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:15,860
just to kind of give you a little bit

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:18,379
more information so it just it has one

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,540
field email so it's just named an email

00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,060
to keep it kind of simple so that we

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,980
and you know really see what's going on

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,760
and know how to how to use this without

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:33,980
a lot of noise and then you know whoa

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:36,280
it's wild oh my goodness hello one

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,280
second

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,160
okay cool um sorry that would just

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,690
bother me the rest of the whole

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,449
presentation because I wouldn't know

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,850
where I was so anyway we've got we've

00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:11,440
got that set up we installed services

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:14,350
using Drudge just drush dl services and

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,449
then enable it and it will download a

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,740
couple dependencies that it has takes

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,959
care of it without a problem there's

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,560
also a yam a library that neat but it

00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:25,480
needed and it is googleable so it tells

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,740
you what you need you google it it shows

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,730
you you download it put it where it

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,860
tells you and you're good to go so then

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,430
and I guess that's rather part of

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,050
downloading and enabling the rest server

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:42,040
and then you just enable the rest server

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:46,690
and from there I was clear to cash

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,100
because I'm never remember to like ever

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,050
if something breaks it's usually the

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,899
cash at least in my personal experience

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:57,160
so it's like a habit to just rush CC all

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:58,630
probably a little too much alright so

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,329
what that does is once those two things

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:06,940
are enabled you now have services which

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:11,470
appears under structure and from here

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,079
you can you can add add an endpoint and

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,040
this is just kind of like a point that

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,410
or it creates a URL that somebody can

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,600
reference to you know access your your

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,790
API that you're doing here so you name

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,319
it whatever you'd like the server we're

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,000
going to select rest because that's the

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,010
server that we the module that we

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,160
enabled and then the endpoint is

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:37,120
actually what they would connect you so

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,889
we are at Drupal services drupal

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,149
daughter rather so the endpoint would be

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,660
whatever's after that so drupal dot

00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:47,100
services / something is that good size

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:51,910
for everybody okay sweet um and then

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,550
session authentication I I just said no

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,260
because keep it anonymous keep it simple

00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:02,699
we want to get the concepts now we can

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,699
dive deeper if if you need to so oops

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,880
we'll go to the just take a look at the

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,290
service that I already set up I just

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,110
called it test service

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:16,840
and if we go to edit resources is kind

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:18,670
of the the next step and here you can

00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,440
see we've got those things that were in

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,930
that Drupal box before so we've got

00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,120
comment file node system taxonomy user

00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,680
all kinds of good stuff and this

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,250
basically says what's going to be

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,980
exposed to this via this endpoint and

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,890
you can you know kind of go a little bit

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,150
deeper with how exactly you want people

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:41,590
to be able to access it or whatnot and

00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,980
one very important thing to note about

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,130
the services module is it inherits all

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,050
of Drupal security so even though we're

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,640
not we're doing like anonymous stuff

00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,190
here like we said you know don't don't

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,080
worry about all that login nonsense if

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,400
you're anonymous if anonymous users

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,990
don't have permission to create content

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,530
or do whatever you want them to do with

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,630
content it's going to turn back in air

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:08,380
so that's just something probably worth

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:11,650
noting and then also under the server

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,620
tab you can select what kind of response

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,390
for matters you want so how do you want

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,980
users to be able to pull information

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,890
what formats you want that information

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,550
to come back in as well as ought as well

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:26,410
as the request parsing so services has

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,760
changed considerably since we initially

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,800
did this so when I was preparing for

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,290
this talk I literally went back and

00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,640
started from the beginning because it's

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,690
you know it's a little bit different a

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,310
lot lot similar so one of the things

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,780
that I had to do was enable this

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:42,460
application your www forum URL encoded

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,420
because that's kind of the format that

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,000
the code that we wrote before uses so

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,300
yeah that is all set up and as we can

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,300
see

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:14,450
there we go the end point for this is

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:16,790
just my API so if we go to it says that

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:22,490
ok cool your endpoint is been set up

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:25,960
successfully that's fantastic and since

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,820
I guess to access the information that

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,500
is defined under that resources you just

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:34,810
do like / node for example and that

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:38,480
pulls you a list of your notes and

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:40,670
before you used to have to adjust like

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,680
the headers in order to change the way

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,920
the information comes back now it's

00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,190
cooler and you just sort of do like JSON

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:53,420
and it returns JSON you want yamel if

00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:58,330
you're one of those movie people you can

00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,330
do that it works just not here

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,760
where did you see that now yeah

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,030
no no the default your I see what you're

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,640
saying I would imagine you could I

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:27,240
haven't just because I don't know

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,660
haven't haven't really tried or anything

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,700
the code that we wrote it were told it

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,060
it told the end point that it wanted

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,440
JSON and using the headers and so this

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,730
is kind of a new feature that I haven't

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:49,380
really played around with much so yeah

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:51,540
that's that's pretty cool so if we look

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,180
at like a rest console which is just

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,720
kind of like a debugging tool this is a

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,990
one for Chrome that I've not used until

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,900
recently in the past I've always used

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,910
poster for Firefox but this seemed kind

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,090
of cool so I thought I'd try it out and

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:18,620
it kind of just gives you a way to

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:21,030
adjust the headers excuse me there we go

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,260
so it's it's the exact same kind of

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,320
thing you know you're going to request

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:31,650
no do you want JSON coming back if you

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:35,340
hit get you get this thing and then if

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:39,930
you wanted a particular node you could

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:42,620
just say you know give me the note I d1

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,620
or whatever and

00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:07,960
I must have broken something that's

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:10,260
unfortunate oh no yeah I cleared out

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,220
everything before I did this so yeah

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,659
there's always a reason why you get

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:20,049
errors it's just whether or not you see

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:23,830
it thank you see if you hit get you get

00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:26,950
the entire node back at you all kinds of

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,480
good stuff Jason's my favorite I'm a

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,460
Jake I'm a JavaScript guy I'd like

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
through the meetup group in Atlanta for

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,450
JavaScript so if you're ever in the area

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,880
and we're doing a meetup we do one twice

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,190
a month workshop j/s which is like

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,500
hands-on kind of stuff and then we do

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,019
like a general one cool cool stuff

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,610
anyway completely sidetracked and then

00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:49,929
it gives you you know that the path to

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:52,690
to where you're going and you can really

00:22:49,929 --> 00:23:00,460
easily create nodes you know through the

00:22:52,690 --> 00:23:01,960
through this you're just going to set

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,510
the payload that goes across so what's

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:10,029
actually going to be posted you got to

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:18,600
send it the title this is Newton and

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:18,600
we'll send it the I'm sorry

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:32,690
tight and then title very basic example

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:36,260
here so if we do a post we get back the

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:44,240
node ID which is 21 as well as the URI

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:46,669
of that through the through the API so

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,210
if we go there for more information or

00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:52,510
whatnot we see that you know the path of

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:56,630
that node is this and if we go to that

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:59,210
we see the note that we just created and

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,510
if we wanted to update this for example

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:05,120
like this is new we're at node ID 21 we

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:08,289
can come back to the rest console change

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:22,029
I'm going to minimize that it's huge

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:31,130
this is new we'll say and if we do a put

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:32,809
two no 21 will hopefully get a so it

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,890
returns this means it's okay if we look

00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:38,000
at the response headers will see the

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:39,440
status codes 200 which is tells you that

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,120
another way to tell it it's that it's

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,399
okay yes it did just update sorry and so

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,250
if we refresh that node will see that

00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,870
the titles changed and so all this is

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:55,250
just done kind of kind of through the

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:59,500
API of any questions so far on this

00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,500
stuff is it making sense there on

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:09,170
yeah yeah i think the the term node is

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,770
just something that they've picked up

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:15,440
from the fact that that's what they used

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,850
to be so i'm pretty sure anything that

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,410
you want to work with and like any

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,050
entity or whatever you can definitely

00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,510
work with i personally haven't but i

00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:29,980
would imagine that that that that would

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:29,980
make sense for me if I were a query

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:38,570
right right that is honestly something

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,010
that's going to be a limitation again

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,710
this is something that that we haven't

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,560
needed to do but the idea with rest is

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,450
that you pull back a whole bunch of

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,520
information and then you work with it

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,040
internally and so that's why when you

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,570
just access the endpoint it returns

00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,200
everything and then you can kind of dive

00:25:53,570 --> 00:26:00,830
deeper into it so queer een is not

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,900
really you know it's it is but it

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,820
doesn't the idea behind rest or whatever

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:11,180
yes unless you know what you're going

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,280
for and and that's the idea of how if

00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,960
you request like / node you get like a

00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,120
list and then you can kind of go down

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,780
from there I'm I would imagine there's

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,100
some sort of querying ability curious if

00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,300
there's views integration honestly

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:33,200
because that would you know make it

00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:35,840
super easy yeah so I'm sorry that the I

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,770
missed questions I didn't repeat them

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,770
back but the question was can you query

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,690
it and it's somebody had mentioned that

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:54,920
yes you know the an easy one way to do

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:58,220
it would be through use yeah so yeah

00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:04,930
that's the kind of kind of basics there

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,930
um I guess what I'll show now is

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:24,490
rather so the way that we kind of used

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,429
services or whatever was we set up an

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:30,309
API in the middle and it uses this

00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:34,390
Drupal rass dot PHP which is just a very

00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:37,419
small helper class that the main reason

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,730
for using it was to persist the session

00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:41,799
so you login you get that cookie you

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,809
save that cookie is a part of that

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,830
object and then you're able to just use

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:50,260
it again and again and again and so this

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:55,000
is on github and there's a link to it in

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:58,390
a slide coming up here but it's I don't

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,470
know it's cool it helped me a lot and I

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:05,799
also wrote 14 in c-sharp d-sharp dotnet

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,130
because we have to integrate with other

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,130
things

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:18,760
um no this this is yeah this would

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,950
actually be the thought this is the

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,350
helper class or whatever is API or

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:28,419
whatever is what you would actually call

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:36,730
so it requires that helper class and

00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:39,760
then from there creates the object and

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,260
then takes again this is really bad code

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,539
is just to show you you know you don't

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,929
want to obviously have that use post

00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:48,789
like that but it's kind of like it just

00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:53,500
shows you that you can abstract it a

00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:55,029
little bit further and then so each of

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,830
these is its own little virtual host and

00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:58,899
I did that to show you that you know

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,000
they don't have to be on the same box

00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,830
they're just by coincidence on the same

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,279
box because we're doing a presentation

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:10,690
and its local so you could have them

00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:12,120
really be anywhere and so what you know

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:16,899
what we do here is we're just defining

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,880
the endpoint and then we are creating

00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:22,149
kind of the structure of the node and

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,950
then calling the create node just sends

00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:29,049
the whole thing off to it's the end

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:33,130
point and then static page is where the

00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:37,960
end user would be and so if we just look

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:41,289
at the code behind that we see it's it's

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,770
just a form and it's called its posting

00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,360
the data to the services that API / AP i

00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,250
dot PHP which is that other script that

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,580
we just looked at and it's got name and

00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:56,080
email create node so this would be

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,399
essentially what we gave to vendors just

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,870
as kind of a you know something that

00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:01,539
they could work with you this was the

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,760
idea of you know you put this form on

00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:05,919
your machine and had a call whatever the

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:11,350
API was you would be able to just add

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:16,510
nodes or whatever so if we do random hit

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:17,950
create knowed it I had it return kind of

00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,270
everything that comes back so we're

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,179
seeing the same thing gives you the note

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,610
ID the ri to it and then

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:30,669
I had a little link here that takes you

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:34,139
to where that is and so again you want

00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:34,139
to check it out we've got it here

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,020
so yeah you can you can kind of send

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,960
that everywhere and then everything

00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,600
comes back to you the kind of the next

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:58,570
step that we are probably going to be

00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:03,730
taking with this is to tie it together

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:05,860
with node nodejs because Drupal 7 is a

00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,100
lot faster for creating nodes but it

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,050
still sucks when you've got a lot of

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,080
stuff happening at the same time it kind

00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,760
of bogs down and we had one case where

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,440
there were so many people hitting it

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,350
like once they submitted the form it was

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,150
taking like a minute or two for for it

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:24,250
to actually create the node and return

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,260
the thank you message to the user so the

00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,420
idea that we are going to be moving

00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:32,680
towards is offloading the initial

00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:34,600
response to node so that it can just

00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,670
return back all right cool we got it and

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,310
then process essentially like a queue or

00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,780
whatever to actually create the nodes so

00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,970
it'll be close to real time it'll be

00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:47,980
plan will be happy they're not dealing

00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:50,250
with the with spreadsheets so yeah let's

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,250
see

00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:06,970
how does what handled it's the yep not

00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:09,879
at all like if you look at it's as if

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:13,330
you've ever worked with a node in a

00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:15,970
module or like with PHP that that object

00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,220
or whatever it's the same so I mean it

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:21,220
just it's exposing that in a different

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:31,119
way so everything that you want to do or

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:32,950
whatever you know can can be done so

00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,679
anyway the helper class that I had there

00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:39,970
it's on github under me probably needs

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:42,639
to be updated but it's there and kind of

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:45,639
the going from here if you're interested

00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:49,389
the project obviously dublado org slash

00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:51,100
project / services follow the links on

00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:55,480
there to read about the rest server and

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,279
whatnot and all the other servers

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,679
because rest is just what I prefer it

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,649
you know you can do whatever with it and

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,779
then last but not least definitely you

00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,519
know provide feedback hopefully positive

00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:09,549
if it's negative don't provide it keep

00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,769
it yourself I'm just kidding um and that

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:13,509
link goes to that the same place that

00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:16,570
everybody else has been saying but I

00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:19,149
don't like letters and like that so I

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:23,379
created a bit ly to go to their thing so

00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:24,460
anyway drupalcamp charlotte sorry i did

00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:28,600
the person that created that in this

00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:33,700
room okay that's about it like just turn

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,340
to riot oh goodness but yeah anywho so

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,809
yeah that's that i'm on twitter Randall

00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:45,389
Kent my email is is that so any

00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:45,389
questions or anything I can do

00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:06,990
it is mm-hmm yes so like for example

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:22,570
exactly exactly in that yes that was

00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,330
part of the but yeah if we go down here

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,429
to Dubai cat bypass access control I

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:32,580
just checked that box just to make it

00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,580
easy or easier

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:13,930
sure oh no you did not um yeah sure yeah

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,430
ya know that right the I guess the idea

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,619
again is that it's everything that you

00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,900
can do with it within like a module or

00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,839
whatever you can do through services so

00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:29,119
when you create a node then that would

00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:36,319
trigger whatever happens on node safe so

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:38,630
everything no no you could ease rules

00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:50,420
but yeah because that's how yeah that's

00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:52,849
how it works in right yeah if if you're

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,430
if you're going to be I guess you want

00:35:52,849 --> 00:36:04,910
it to win when you do something to make

00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:07,849
a call externally um you might could do

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:11,390
that but yeah now you'd have to I mean

00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:13,760
it it's it's more meant to expose what's

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,520
inside and let you do what you want it

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,450
to do but you can definitely extend it

00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:23,780
you can definitely have kind of it act

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,200
as a as a client so that whole layered

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,059
idea of client server client whatever

00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,650
you can do that but likely you're going

00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:32,329
to need to code something somewhere

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,290
along the lines which is cool because

00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:35,290
rest makes it

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:45,180
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,370
way to better utilize all your resources

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,820
and it makes managing all your resources

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:54,650
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:58,140
happening in open source the

00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:59,970
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,890
of the community and the speed at which

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,050
these are these you know these

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,360
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,210
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,210
that really shows the power of the of

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,690
the open source community it is global

00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:18,210
and it's definitely because of the users

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:23,850
community people are extremely friendly

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:25,740
and they're almost ready to help if you

00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,020
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,750
guys helping each other out and they're

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,460
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:35,450
the product is transparent for everyone

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,610
everyone can look at the code base

00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:40,880
everyone can see how close that is being

00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:46,380
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:49,020
everything is open in many ways it's

00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,460
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:57,660
health CloudStack the most exciting

00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,510
event in recent memory for me was our

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,150
first developer boot camp

00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,790
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:09,750
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:13,920
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:16,770
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,290
chairs into the room twice everything

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:22,560
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:25,620
is open source and so I don't think that

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,540
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,990
sources not pervasive in cloud computing

00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:33,150
and so i think it's i think it's an

00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,650
assumption i think when you talk about

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:39,480
cloud computing you're really talking

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:41,760
about open source cloud computing cloud

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,520
sac is a robust solution for large

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,920
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,940
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,210
data centers these hardware is going to

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:57,420
fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:59,910
handle number one that mass scale number

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:02,640
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:05,160
that inevitably happens in large

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,700
deployments we started working on pop

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,060
attack over four years ago and it was

00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,730
the original set of people working on it

00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:18,840
had a background of delivering software

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:23,070
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:26,700
lots of users actually using it high

00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:29,760
availability is the key feature multiple

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,800
hypervisors support different network

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,470
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,720
you better while step management server

00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:40,410
can be deployed in different physical

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,060
machines it definitely has a huge

00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:47,070
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:49,650
there's a major movie studio that they

00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,950
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,930
to transcode video and i thought that

00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,580
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,850
more fascinating is what they did during

00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:02,610
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,840
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,610
lunch was over they would destroy

00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,750
all the instances and go back to doing

00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:11,370
real work cloudstack is vast it touches

00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,470
so many different aspects and there's no

00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:15,840
one person that's kind of like a master

00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:19,950
of all those realms I think cloudstack

00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,170
as a project is going to be one of the

00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:26,220
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:31,680
most feature fallen and and robust

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:34,580
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,580
living through the clouds dag

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,200
you

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,489
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,469
ago we could not have imagined that

00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:32,660
asterisk would not only become the most

00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,789
widely adopted open source communication

00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,829
software on the planet but that it would

00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:39,349
impact the entire industry in the way

00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:41,329
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:43,969
way into more than 170 countries and

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,920
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:47,989
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,430
transition of power from the hands of

00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:51,709
the traditional proprietary phone

00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,079
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:56,029
administrators of phone systems using

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,259
this power our customers have created

00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:59,209
all sorts of business changing

00:41:57,259 --> 00:42:01,039
applications from small office phone

00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:03,559
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,180
the international carrier networks in

00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,950
fact there's even an entire country

00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,559
those communications infrastructure runs

00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,479
on esters the gym has always been about

00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,190
creating technology that expands

00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:15,349
communications capabilities in ways that

00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,729
we could never have imagined and that's

00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:19,369
part of what's game-changing about the

00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:21,829
gym today we're doing it again this time

00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:23,930
by introducing a new family of HD IP

00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,209
phones that extends control of the user

00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,979
all the way to the desktop the launch of

00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:29,499
these new products represents the next

00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:32,150
phase indigenous history of innovation

00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:34,099
these are the first and only IP phones

00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,690
designed to fully leverage the power of

00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:37,309
estrus when we first discussed our

00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,109
expectations for building a family of

00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:41,269
phones for use with asterisk our

00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:43,009
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:44,630
the team to build the phones such that

00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:46,849
they were easy to install integrate

00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,680
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:51,259
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,880
that goal user feedback is validating

00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:55,009
that when it comes to operation with

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,440
astro space systems including our own

00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:59,989
Switchvox based product these are the

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,309
easiest to use best integrated most

00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:03,890
interoperable products on the market

00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:05,890
today the digitally phones will

00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,940
initially include three IP des hommes

00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,890
uniquely designed to complement any

00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,749
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,420
these phones are different for a number

00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:17,059
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,499
designed for use with esters secondly

00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,109
we've made it really easy to

00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:22,519
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:24,589
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:26,539
to access information inside of asterisk

00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:28,150
allowing tight coupling between an

00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:30,140
application and the

00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:32,270
additionally we've created an

00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,400
applications engine that allows users

00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:37,640
and developers to create and run their

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,410
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,360
done all of this at a very compelling

00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,040
price point at digium we're always

00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,140
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,720
the best value in business phone systems

00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,370
and also give them the power to create

00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,410
their own solutions or eating

00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:53,120
communications challenge will continue

00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,560
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,600
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,220
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,710
asterisk and what communications even

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:04,420
easier and together we'll change the way

00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,420
