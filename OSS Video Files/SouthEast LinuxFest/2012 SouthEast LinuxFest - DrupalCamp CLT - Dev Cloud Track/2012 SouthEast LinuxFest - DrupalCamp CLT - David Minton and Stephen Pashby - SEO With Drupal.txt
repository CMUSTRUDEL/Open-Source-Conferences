talk that we regularly give talks about

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,030
SEO in general and so be great to get

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,800
some feedback at the end so we've got

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,559
thing about 75 slides but we should be

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,600
able to move through them pretty quickly

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,710
we'll see how we're doing on time and if

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,380
we've got a chance to take some

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,900
questions during the talk so if you've

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,380
got some will try to answer them and if

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,640
not then we'll have some time later so

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,810
just to give you come an overview what

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,650
we're going to talk about we'll do a

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,450
little bit about our philosophy on SEO

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,790
and some fundamentals and then we're

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,200
going to go into three major areas will

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,360
talk about off page SEO on-site SEO and

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,500
on page SEO and why it's kind of

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,400
relevant to see these three things

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,500
differently so here's a little bit about

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,140
the fundamentals and our philosophy

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,759
about addressing SEO so I'll hand this

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,920
off to Steven to talk about the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,600
fundamentals so why worry about SEO you

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,759
know you've seen you've seen the movie

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,070
if they build it or if you build it they

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:59,070
will come wrong you know good next slide

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,020
basically folks will find you if you

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,790
appear in the search rankings not just

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,610
because you build a site so search

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,890
engine optimization is quite important

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,879
if you want people to actually check out

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,620
what's on your site we tend to focus on

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,409
Google as it has

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,400
lion's share of at least the US market

00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,720
and generally english-speaking market

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,720
but you know that's one thing to think

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,670
about depending on who you're who your

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,920
audience is what search engines they use

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,670
as to how you optimize for but this talk

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:39,060
is primarily geared at Google just a

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:44,040
quote from a SEO Moz co-founder it's

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,799
just pretty straightforward not a whole

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,959
lot of difference there so one of the

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:53,010
things that we find that it's kind of

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:55,620
interesting with with SEO is there are

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,950
widely accepted kind of best practices

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:04,560
but no one really knows how Google works

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:08,040
except for google so the the Google

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,690
wants to protect kind of their their

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,109
algorithm what they're doing so

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,720
basically a lot of SEO is kind of

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,790
reverse engineering and trying to see

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,930
what works and then google says hey you

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,340
know what these folks are appearing

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,380
higher than we want so we're going to

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,560
alter our algorithm you all can figure

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,150
it out so you know Google kind of works

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,120
in mysterious ways so there are a couple

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,629
different types of SEO one you may be

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,299
familiar with is pay-per-click there's

00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,230
also organic search and with organic

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,319
search there are a lot of different

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,260
things that you can kind of control both

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,620
off page optimization on-site

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,449
optimization and on-page optimization so

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,019
paid per click you know essentially

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:58,199
advertising google adwords yahoo search

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,269
marketing microsoft adcenter not really

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,000
based on your website content so not

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,829
really relevant to exactly how you set

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,359
your website up so we're not really

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,919
going to cover that a whole lot but it

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,859
is a way to drive traffic to your site

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,500
so you should at least keep it in mind

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:16,590
off page examples incoming links from

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,449
other websites it's pretty big including

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,780
links that you can kind of control such

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:25,650
as links that you tweet or post other

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,450
social media on site examples if you've

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,700
got search keywords you

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,680
to find be found for in your domain name

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:36,390
in your file path having an XML sitemap

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,750
also your server availability and load

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,600
times all kind of factor into your

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,790
search engine placement and then on page

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,320
examples actually having the search

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,490
terms that you want to be found for in

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,380
your page title and page headlines in

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,370
image and Link attributes in addition to

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:59,160
in the text of your content so this is a

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,140
search engine result play page or SERP

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,700
so we just kind of go through some of

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,790
the different parts of that so these are

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,940
ads so you all know this I mean you've

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,040
gone to Google right so folks tend to

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,660
know where that is so that where folks

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,610
tend to go for trusted information is

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,020
the organic listings which are down

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,840
below so we've got search for web design

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,960
in durham and we've showed up kind of

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,020
the anatomy of that so we've got the

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,360
page title so fairly important and then

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,860
the URL and the description now a couple

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,680
of things you kind of notice about this

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,920
right off the bat we saw our search with

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:42,020
sword Durham web design and Google helps

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,290
us out it says hey website design is in

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,360
the title so let's put that in bold and

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:52,590
design is in the URL so let's bold that

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,260
there and Durham web design is in the

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,350
description so let's go ahead and put

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,060
that at and bold too so if you've got

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,970
the keywords that you're looking for

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,350
regardless of where you rank in certain

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,630
places you can kind of influence some

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,710
user behavior to get them to your site

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:16,440
so pretty helpful so we like to think

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,730
with good next slide okay right so I'll

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,350
take over and we'll start talking about

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,480
our philosophy but one thing I'll point

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,150
out here is you'll notice in just your

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,740
typical Google Google search result

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,050
there's very little that someone's going

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,760
to go by and everybody seems to be

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,080
really fixated on getting number one

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,970
results but if you think about it

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,100
there's really a lot more to that and

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,330
someone's making the decision based on

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,330
this information right here

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,680
so it's more than just number 1 rankings

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:47,100
so in some ways we think about usability

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,780
as well it's not just numbers what are

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,690
the keyword phrases what are the results

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,170
and how do they change over time but how

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,000
is someone going to interact and so I

00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,850
think if there's anything you get out of

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,050
this talk it's probably going to be this

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,210
slide right here where we talk about

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,380
user behavior and it's going to be

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,360
something that's really obvious to

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,370
everybody once they see it but I'm kind

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,320
of surprised when I talk to people maybe

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,500
this is a sharper crowd than most since

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,390
you're all drupal developers and users

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,080
but everybody seems to be focused on a

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,610
top search position phase one and then

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,890
we go to phase three and we've got

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,870
profit and we all know that's just

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:33,000
direct there is no phase two is there

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:37,400
well is that true not really you get a

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,400
top search position that the question is

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,450
that's the search you thought of but is

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,150
that a search that your users thought of

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,920
and your potential customers if they're

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,750
not doing that search that number one

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,880
search position did nothing for you and

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,680
if you're not optimizing your site for

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,740
the searches are actually doing all of

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,380
your time is wasted so if it's not

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,720
optimized for the users searches you've

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,640
failed okay so you have figured out what

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,590
search phrases your users are doing the

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,250
searches for and you've got respectable

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:13,110
rankings then next question is we think

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,360
back at the SERP and we've all done this

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,750
you do a search you look at the number

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,550
one result you look at the title you

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,760
look at the description you look at the

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,650
URL and it doesn't seem to be what

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,450
you're looking for and you pass over it

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,730
and you go to one of the lower ranking

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,230
or even go to subsequent pages or you

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:36,420
give up and do another search so

00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:40,230
obviously that's even you know really

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:44,250
important as well that all of you are on

00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:46,620
page optimization or off page or on site

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,270
to get top rankings and you haven't

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,920
written a good description a good title

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,860
and someone doesn't click through to

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,140
your site it's all so wasted effort

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,700
alright so you've managed to do both now

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,380
people are clicking through but were

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,720
they going there's a good chance to go

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,660
into your home page and if it's not

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,890
obvious what they're looking for is on

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,779
your home page is a good chance they're

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,519
going to give up and bounds every one of

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,480
us has done searches every one of us has

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,970
done that so more successful searches

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,100
you've probably wound up on a page some

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,470
home landing pages that are optimized

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,769
for that term you realize I have found

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,510
exactly what I'm looking for if not you

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,360
might bounce go back do another search

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,240
result and if you do then you've got a

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,370
greater chance of performing some kind

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,490
of a transaction that we can equate to

00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,560
his profit and this is something that a

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,959
lot of people in SEO lose sight of all

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,940
they focus on is getting that top search

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,100
result and it's really a much more

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,839
complicated process and so that's an

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,459
essential part of our philosophy and why

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,560
we're talking about also two different

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:57,779
aspects of SEO so i'll i'll continue on

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,600
and talk a little bit about different

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:05,100
off page optimization so one of the key

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,920
things and off pages links so links are

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,540
really powerful you remember link well

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,399
notnot that link we're talking about

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,529
incoming links and here's a great

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,990
example i use for SEO it's used for all

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,820
sorts of different things i do a search

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,130
for click here and if you notice it's a

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,680
little hard to read but they're actually

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,040
over three billion results returned if

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,930
you do a search on click here so that's

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,550
give you you know something in

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,459
comparison to search on the beatles you

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,529
only get about 68 million you can throw

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,089
in all sorts of pro sports and you still

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,140
only get about half the results of how

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,060
many pages there are that have the the

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,540
phrase click here on them so it's a

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,899
really competitive term now if you look

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,959
and see what's the top result for click

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,699
here to dobie acrobat reader this is

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,829
actually from a couple years ago this is

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:03,180
when the few slides that survived from a

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,860
previous talk and you know this is even

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,270
someone who is smart there's a marketing

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,550
agency that's probably done this

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,170
example as well and they named their

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,110
agency click here because they know

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:17,240
people like me do this example for

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,980
presentation so the question is out of

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:28,470
over three billion pages that have click

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:31,100
here why did this page show up and what

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,100
kind of backlinks

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:49,230
yep so who's said click here you in a

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:51,730
book congratulations and that's so

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,220
they're probably tens of thousands if

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,460
not more pages out there on the internet

00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:02,410
that have click here as the anchor text

00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,640
to that page so even though everything

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,110
that we sort of know if you know

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,540
something about SEO is all about getting

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,250
keyword phrases in the right part of

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,200
your page and on your site to optimize

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,600
for that term and here at a three

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,190
billion results a page that doesn't have

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,589
that phrase anywhere on it shows up

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:22,089
number one and it's all because of what

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:23,440
we call off page optimization but on the

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:26,110
other side of that since this is just an

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,400
example and does anybody actually do

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,220
searches for click here other than

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,980
people trying to do this presentation

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,630
here's a graph from google trends and

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,089
you can see you know in comparison what

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,589
people really look for the Beatles are

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,390
like a little line at the bottom and

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:45,790
some other terms are actually much

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:47,470
farther towards the top so that kind of

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,720
gets us into you know what we talked

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,830
about which was keyword research that

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,140
you really need to know what phrases

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,790
your users are searching for and trying

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,910
to make sure that you can get them among

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,710
other things into backlinks because you

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,750
know isn't it great that they're number

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,460
one out of three billion but it's a

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,650
phrase nobody uses even though they

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,020
didn't work for it if they had worked

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,210
harder to get people to actually use

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,070
other words as part of the anchor text

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,770
they would have had all that incoming

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,589
link power to get a more useful phrase

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,750
to be at the top of the SERP that was

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:30,580
actually useful to them so now we'll

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:32,260
move into on-site optimization so here

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,240
we're going to start getting into some

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:38,190
more Drupal stuff so everybody familiar

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,190
with robots.txt files

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,860
so if you're not it's a file at the root

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,060
of your web server and it tells crawlers

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:54,770
generally search engines which pages

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:56,390
they should or should not address as far

00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,940
as SEO goes this is probably the

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,130
absolute most important thing to get

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,000
right there is nothing else more

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,770
important than that I'll show you why

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,660
this is actually what the robots.txt

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,370
module looks like in Drupal 7 I think

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,900
Drupal 6 looks pretty similar just lets

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:20,900
you edit Steve and I doing some research

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,750
for a client came across the site don't

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,130
be these guys looks like you know they

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,020
put a little effort into this website

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:32,570
probably want people to find them on

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,420
search so if I do a search for their

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,500
domain they get a number one listing

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:43,100
does anyone here ever seen a listing

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:47,530
like that in google it's no description

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,530
there's no title do you know why

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,720
they could have put incredible amount of

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,250
time on all sorts of optimization but

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,880
they told google we don't want you to

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,430
see our site yep yep they've told

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,290
everybody so as I said you know they

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,700
probably had this on their dev server to

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,970
keep their dev server from getting

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,770
indexed and then forgot to change it so

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,870
as I said if you get nothing out of this

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:25,130
talk with that never make that mistake

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:26,540
don't be these guys I mean honestly

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,860
actually something that we do is we

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,630
don't put in our dev server to make sure

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:40,970
we don't make that mistake and we just

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:44,090
put HD access over our dev server so XML

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,580
sitemaps it's something to help search

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,070
engines find particular pages they

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,810
probably know about your site but if

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,340
you're updating site very regularly it

00:15:50,810 --> 00:16:04,210
helps them find new pages and new

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:10,370
revisions of pages and so it's got URLs

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:12,260
last update how frequently pages update

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,900
and you can give them a hint of how

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:19,030
important you think the pages are

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,030
relative to other pages in the site and

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:26,480
this is what a rendered site map looks

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,720
like in Drupal 7 and so you can see the

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,820
different columns one of the things

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,970
that's nice in in the modules you can

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:40,010
set it to automatically publish these

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:42,140
and to notify being in Google that

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:45,560
you've got XML sitemaps and since as we

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:48,070
noted they do they handle about eighty

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,390
percent of search traffic in the u.s. so

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:56,540
even if you just do those two you're

00:16:50,390 --> 00:17:00,339
going to do pretty well and then we can

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,499
talk about URLs path path auto

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,020
you want to hand this off to Steven so

00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:07,630
you can do some more talking I don't

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,480
want you get tired David so you got a

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,880
couple different options with Drupal

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,089
regarding your path one of the strengths

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,630
of of Drupal is actually allows you to

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:21,970
use clean paths which are pretty helpful

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:28,929
so it's pretty important to get this

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:33,070
right good next time so here is just a

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:37,990
core path with clean urls disabled it's

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,940
pretty messy a lot of the the path stuff

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,820
can be very useful particularly if

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,559
you've got folks who are passionate

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,230
about your content and social media and

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,840
they're going to be sharing URLs you

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,870
want this actually one copy and paste

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,279
clean so actually get there and if you

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,080
can get a little extra benefit out of it

00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:00,279
which we're going to see that's nice so

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,950
with clean urls enabled take out the

00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:05,320
query there but if you put something

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,200
like the path module in their automated

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,320
by path auto you're able to actually

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,779
create some human readable URLs and a

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,029
lot of times this is going to be pulled

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:20,140
from for example your your content title

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:22,630
there are some other options for that

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,789
and so with with that content title

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,529
that's likely going to be some keywords

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,630
that you would like that page to be

00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,190
found by just because you know you

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,649
probably titled it something about the

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:36,190
content on the page and so if someone

00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:37,539
posts that on facebook hey they just put

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,539
some of your keywords in a link going to

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:45,090
your site this isn't that awesome so we

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:47,649
can check out the clean urls module

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,580
pretty straightforward enable clean urls

00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:55,120
a good thing to do and then path and

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,700
path auto there are you can set up with

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,830
different aliases that you'd like to do

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,450
this you can also do some stuff with

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,809
different tokens if you want to kind of

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,399
mess with a bit more you want to jump

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,850
back to canonical redirect you want me

00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:08,850
to take that

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,590
so we talked about making some clean

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,700
urls and preferably even human readable

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:21,530
paths with paths and paths auto and now

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,430
we can talk about redirects and

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,590
canonical so with redirects you can

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,850
redirect from one path to another so

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,430
it's possible for some reason that

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:37,310
you're going to want to have multiple

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:39,170
different paths get to the same page and

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,790
you can do that with Alice's another

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,530
thing that's really important is if

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,750
you're doing a redesign either from a

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,160
different platform or even from one

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,110
version of Drupal to another and you

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,460
decide to rearrange contents from your

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:54,170
site you really want to do redirects and

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,810
which are effectively 301 to read

00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,490
redirects for a couple of reasons one

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,700
just usability they're probably a lot of

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:04,730
incoming links to your site and anyone

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,350
who's going to get a 404 page is more

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,750
likely going to bounce off your site

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,360
rather than finding the content they

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,080
want and also as we talked about there's

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,660
a lot of power in incoming links and so

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,890
if there are a lot of incoming links

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,300
you're going to lose your credit you're

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,920
going to get from the search engines if

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,980
they're going to get a 404 pages rather

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,800
than to real content so for both the

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,100
usability and the SEO purposes you want

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,970
to be really good about making sure all

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:38,780
of your links are current here's on the

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:42,830
path redirect module and one of the neat

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:45,830
things about it to help with our 30 ones

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,150
is you've got an option of a listing of

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,660
all the four or four errors that you're

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:54,580
getting a lot of them are going to be

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:57,410
probably bogus or attacks like this

00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:00,050
domain in question has never been a

00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,450
wordpress site and so people trying to

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,950
get to wordpress login dot PHP are

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,320
probably just trying to do some kind of

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:11,300
script based attack but on the other

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,280
hand if you find some listings that are

00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,750
real pages even if there aren't that

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,660
many of them it's always good to fix

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,620
them because you'll help your SEO

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,150
results and the usability

00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,480
and it's always easier to fix it on your

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,730
site then try to track down which site

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,510
has an old URL in it and then somehow

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:32,309
getting them to fix it and then there's

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,220
a canonical which is kind of interesting

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:38,690
this is something that Google has been

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,820
pushing rather than doing 30 ones for

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,520
duplicate content and so this isn't like

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,160
aliases that you have one page and for

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,230
some reason you want to have multiple

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,600
paths that go to it but for some reason

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,260
you actually have multiple nodes that

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,580
have very similar or identical content

00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,390
there's some different reasons we want

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,040
to do that but one of the things that

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:06,870
Google doesn't like to see is duplicate

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,780
content you can get penalized especially

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:13,170
more if you've got content from other

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,600
sites and they think that you're ripping

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,059
off content if you've got multiple sites

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,130
that you own and therefore you're not

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,750
stealing content from somebody else it's

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,090
important to do this but the other thing

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,390
is we talked about the power of incoming

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:30,240
links if you have say five very similar

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,190
pages that are all effectively the same

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,720
information and if somebody landed on

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,960
any one of them it would be just as good

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:41,309
as the others what you can do is use the

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,559
canonical tag and to say this one page

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,300
is essentially the master and any

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,670
incoming links that go to any of those

00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,190
other pages treat them as if they went

00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:54,059
to the canonical one and therefore if

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:57,210
you had say 100 links and eight even go

00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:59,370
to one and 15 go to one and five go to

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,890
one if you use the canonical to the one

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,809
that gets a tee Google will treat as if

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,040
it was getting 100 so it's going to help

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:10,230
it so we talked about preventing

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,170
dilution of the incoming links and also

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,150
reduces the chance of a penalty

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:19,830
originally Google required the canonical

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:22,200
would be limited to pages on that site

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:26,730
but recently they've allowed you to do

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,890
it across domains and that's something

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,390
that can be done through the meta tag

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,510
module you actually have to kind of

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,270
scroll down it's

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,880
in the Advanced section but for any

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,650
particular node you would add what the

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,270
master one is and I don't believe you

00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,390
actually have to put it into the master

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,660
because it's it is the master but I

00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,240
don't think it hurts if you do I now

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,790
will shift back to on-page optimization

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,930
which is the part of SEO that people are

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:58,270
probably most familiar with so one of

00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,320
the things with on-page optimization is

00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,750
you're actually going to be trying to

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,630
optimize your content for search results

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,730
so we're going to talk about a couple of

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,100
modules and also probably some best

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,970
practices for how to actually fill out

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,650
the content of your Drupal site just to

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,600
kind of make sure that we're doing the

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:21,700
right things so probably two of the most

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,310
important things if we kind of think

00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,880
back to the cert page we looked at

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,860
earlier are the page title and then the

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,660
Meta Description so the page title is

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,120
your most important tag for SEO while

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:40,210
the robots.txt you got to get that right

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,280
to get index at all this is probably the

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:47,350
single most important tag that you can

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:51,700
have on your page it is the top item in

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:56,350
your syrup listing now Google will

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:58,360
choose what part of that it shows so if

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,540
you've got a long run it will truncate

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:05,680
it down if it's too long and it will

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,660
actually pick if if you've got kind of

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,240
one's pretty long but it feels like

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,150
password normally would that's the

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,080
relevant stuff it'll pull that over to

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,210
your over to your surplus ting but it's

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,920
you know very important now your default

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:28,300
and Drupal is a node title bar site

00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:30,760
right which can be fine but a lot of

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,010
times you'll want to optimize that maybe

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,100
a little differently to take advantage

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:40,660
of the ability of google to pull out

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,890
some different keyword phrases that

00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,630
you're not going to want to have in your

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,070
node title because you know titles on

00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,750
your page and that's something that

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,820
you're your users are going to be

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,779
reading and so it could look a little

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:55,919
funky if you like SEO da duh da duh you

00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:58,600
know it doesn't look very good so

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,529
actually being able to separate that out

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:09,039
allows for you to either individually

00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:10,210
craft ones for each page or to do kind

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,490
of a token based approach and their

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,960
modules so allow for this sort of

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,600
optimization so we're going to just go

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,669
through two of them really quickly so we

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,129
could either individually create for

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:27,519
each page or procedurally create via

00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:29,320
tokens in Drupal 6 page title module you

00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,919
can see can do kind of token based

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:37,480
approach or you can actually go through

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:39,789
the when you're creating the node just

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,549
type it in the same sort of thing meta

00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,669
tags in Drupal 7 really is kind of taken

00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:47,559
a lot of these pieces and put them under

00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:50,289
one roof and does a really really good

00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:54,159
job with it and so here's an example of

00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:55,720
using it in Drupal 7 that's kind of the

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,730
basic one but again you could either

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,919
clear that out do something custom for

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,080
that page particularly if it's a landing

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,360
page you're really targeting from a lot

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,419
of different efforts or just set it up

00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:13,299
you know to do whatever your site

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:14,559
philosophy is a meta description so the

00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,870
meta description is kind of an

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:21,220
interesting one this is an opportunity

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:24,159
for you to entice site visitors so if we

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,960
think back to our cert page again we

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,929
added the title where the URL and then

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:33,929
we had a description now the Meta

00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:38,500
Description is not used to determine

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:40,840
your placement but Google and Bing and

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,129
Yahoo may choose to use the meta

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,419
description or part of the Meta

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:49,919
Description as that description of the

00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:53,139
page listing so that can be very handy

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,370
if the search engine determines its

00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,559
relevant so it allows you to kind of

00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,320
craft that a little bit more because we

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,600
all know that we go to search

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,240
results if you see something that looks

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,710
like kind of gobbledygook you're less

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,840
likely to click on that one as opposed

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,909
if you see one that looks like hey that

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,679
sounds like what I'm talking about and

00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:12,750
it looks like it's kind of put together

00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,549
professionally so again you're

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,649
influencing user behavior through the

00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:18,750
Meta Description so again it's not

00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:21,419
counted for placement it allows content

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,000
creators to craft a targeted description

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,009
of the page and it with the proper

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,409
modules it can be individually created

00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:32,940
for each page or procedurally created

00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:36,840
via tokens for Drupal 6 you want to look

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:41,610
at node words and for Drupal 7 once

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:43,169
again meta tags and again you can just

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,870
edit that right as you're editing your

00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:49,320
content and you can either create a a

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:53,669
crafted one or do a pursuit really

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,429
created one crafting for meta

00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:58,889
description is probably the way to go

00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:01,289
you may with page so I don't want to go

00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:05,340
with a kind of a procedural approach but

00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:07,320
really I think for most of the time if

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,190
it's a page you really care about people

00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:15,120
finding actually creating a crafted meta

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,190
description is pretty important now so

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,279
that's kind of some module based

00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:23,309
approaches another really important

00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:28,320
thing is structure versus presentation

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:31,019
in your content so I assume that we've

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,929
got most folks in here are kind of some

00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:38,070
basic understanding of HTML so you know

00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:44,570
you've got your style and your structure

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:51,620
so title tag already got that in control

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:53,940
h1 generally is your node title so

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,139
that's already kind of in there and

00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:01,009
we've got paragraph title for example

00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:02,820
presentation would be you know style.css

00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:06,870
so we're going to look at a couple

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:09,570
examples of good structure your kind of

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,650
got nice layout you've got your top

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,680
headline got your sub headlines

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:19,000
and then come how that lays out with

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,620
structure and then this looks pretty

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,820
much the same right i mean it's same

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,230
sort of thing i can see where the

00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,870
headline is i can see where the sub

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:29,230
headlines are except this is all

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,690
accomplished with with style there's no

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:37,270
structure here so the problem with this

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:38,860
is that search engines make the

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,140
assumption that if something is a

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,520
headline the words in that are more

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,460
important than the stuff that's in the

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,840
content and so if you want to take

00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,770
advantage of that you need to make sure

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:55,750
that you may enable your content

00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:57,790
creators to actually use that and be

00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,790
educate your content creators to

00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:03,970
actually use that so a lot of times you

00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,100
know we'll get hired by a client to do

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,230
some SEO for them and we'll go and look

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:12,130
at whatever CMS they happen to be using

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:15,190
and realize that for example headlines

00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,990
are filtered out of their their content

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,880
editing so they're unable to actually do

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,620
this we actually have to make sure that

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,110
you empower your content creators to

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:28,390
actually use proper structure as

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:33,760
appropriate and that you educate them to

00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:35,410
use proper structure so that's kind of

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,940
you know that does that make sense the

00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,530
underlying difference between structure

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,670
and style and how that can be pretty

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:48,900
important for SEO so another important

00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,900
thing about SEO is it never really ends

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,760
it's not well I've optimized my website

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,560
for SEO I'm done I'm going to go do

00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,810
something else as there are other

00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,470
websites they're like to do you know

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:04,770
have a top placement so it's a contest

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:07,210
you know it's kind of an ongoing race

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:11,680
there can only ever be one number one

00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:15,670
placement for one term and in order to

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:19,660
move up in the results you have to get

00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:22,330
over other websites and then another

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:25,070
pretty important hurdle is if you don't

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,769
do proper keyword research

00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:31,490
it can be really a lot of wasted effort

00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:33,380
anyone ever gotten the emails we can

00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:37,549
make you number one guaranteed in five

00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:40,159
terms so I mean yeah you can and a lot

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:41,720
of times well we'll have clients and

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,399
like Bo here are the terms will be

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,350
optimized for is like well that doesn't

00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:47,710
sound like anything your desired

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,059
audience is ever actually searching for

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:53,690
but that's that's that's that's what we

00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:55,279
call it well that's nice but if you want

00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,889
people who are searching for something

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,480
to find you uniquely did have that on

00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:04,580
your site may be good idea so you know

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,320
actually all this stuff without keyword

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,470
research is really a shot in the dark

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,250
and if you've got a site a lot of Drupal

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,480
sites a lot of content creation going on

00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,669
you need to actually have your content

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,159
creators on board to make this

00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:21,740
successful so it's not just about

00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,149
setting up the modules correctly you

00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:27,500
actually need to make sure that folks

00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:30,080
are on board and you know willing to to

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,779
do fill in the right fields we had we

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,210
had a another client who we did some SEO

00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:36,200
training like all that that's great

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:39,009
that's too much work we're not going to

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,250
do that all right well you know that

00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:44,720
that's that's your choice but you're not

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,090
going to get the benefit of having a

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:53,000
system that allows you to do this if you

00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:56,570
don't actually fill it out so you want

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,779
conclude David yeah give my take on some

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,220
of the hurdles as well one of the big

00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:04,940
things that a lot of people forget is

00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,740
that SEO really is a race when the other

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,109
things we do consulting on is

00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,329
accessibility accessibility is great

00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:13,520
because everyone can be a winner the

00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:16,970
ultimate goal is all websites are

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,109
accessible to everyone and I don't know

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,169
if we'll ever make it but it's a great

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,329
goal it can happen SEO everyone can't be

00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:26,780
number one for the term that they want

00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:28,940
it's just it can't happen and as soon as

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,250
you manage to do it the only way that

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,079
you got to be number one is the former

00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,760
number one is not there anymore and

00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,730
there's a good chance that they probably

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,159
put a lot of time and money

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,260
into getting to be number one and they

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,510
probably want to get back there and so

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,460
no matter what you do today someone else

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,990
is going to try to up you tomorrow and

00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,780
there's a good chance you'll get knocked

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:53,419
off so it's a constant struggle and the

00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,889
other thing going back to Stevens quote

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:57,290
about Google as Google works in

00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,270
mysterious ways and they're constantly

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,750
changing their algorithm and so what

00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,800
worked yesterday may not work tomorrow

00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,440
we've had a bunch of clients recently

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,930
who said we used to be on the first page

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,460
and now we're on the tenth page and I

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,880
didn't change anything what happened

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:17,119
well because Google made some major

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:20,810
changes and they penalize people with

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,910
incoming links to from what they call

00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,700
low-quality sites and so essentially

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:29,240
people who hired kind of less scrupulous

00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:31,820
SEO consultants who got them a boost by

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,070
getting their site linked from what we

00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,800
call link farms or other low-quality

00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:40,130
sites and it worked for a while and and

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,600
a lot of kind of disruptive alessio the

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,700
reason people do it is because it works

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,710
you're not supposed to do it and if you

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,020
get caught you get punished but it works

00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,630
and that's why the search engines don't

00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,130
want you to do it and so you've got to

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,910
constantly keep up with all these

00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:57,830
different changes and no matter what you

00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,000
do today you have to keep up and you

00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,220
have to keep working on it because

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,940
someone will bound to do a better job

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:09,290
than you are tomorrow and the other

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,630
thing just really stressed as Stephen

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,460
said is is if you are not the content

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:16,490
creators for your site you have to get

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,020
them to buy in that once you've done the

00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,990
research you know what the phrases are

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,490
you've done your best practices for

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,530
Drupal so the site is set up so that

00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:26,540
they can optimize their content they

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,090
actually have to do it they have to be

00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,440
aware of what the terms are and then

00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,119
they've got to work that those terms

00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,460
into the content and they also have to

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,920
do it correctly that it's best to use

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,470
headlines they've got to write good

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,420
titles to entice people they've got to

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,640
write good meta descriptions to entice

00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,280
people and if they're not going to do

00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,220
that work then all of your best

00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,050
practices that you're doing is the site

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:56,570
builders is just

00:36:51,050 --> 00:37:02,740
going to go to waste so just kind of

00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:07,160
going to conclusion which is essentially

00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:09,080
we really like working in Drupal it's

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,420
got a really good foundation for doing

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,420
good SEO sometimes there's kind of some

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,890
hiccups when this new version released

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,050
we were really comfortable working in

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,300
six and then seven came out and we all

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,430
know some of those key modules just

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,860
weren't ready and we had to kind of

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,990
struggle luckily somebody stepped up and

00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,270
you know made the modules that we needed

00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,190
to be able to the optimization

00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,960
optimization and seven and now there's a

00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,020
really good suite of modules for seven

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,670
and we're hoping that the transition to

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,610
eight when it comes is going to be even

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,750
smoother than the transition from six to

00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:46,400
seven was so we'll kind of run through a

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,490
few more slides and then we'll go into

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,510
some questions we'd like to thank

00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:56,210
drupalcamp charlotte for allowing us to

00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:59,240
speak and also want to put in a plug for

00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:01,580
the drupal association which i hope

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,610
everyone is familiar with design hammer

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:07,010
is a member organization Drupal

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,680
organization is the group that needs to

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:13,960
raise money to allow free software to

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,490
work drupal.org costs money to run

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,730
drupal camps are a lot of work and

00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,470
rather the drupal cons so I think

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,330
individual memberships are pretty

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,340
inexpensive they're like 30 bucks a year

00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:28,790
and the organization one's pretty cheap

00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,950
too that we're asked to talk about a

00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,190
survey that was online i'm not sure if

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,870
this is different than the paper one

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:40,220
it's different okay so if anyone wants

00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:42,860
to jot this down there's an online

00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,730
survey that the organizers the camp

00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,730
would like you to do

00:38:52,940 --> 00:39:00,770

give away prizes periodically we haven't

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,030
announced one but I think we'll probably

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:50,839
be giving one away when the next week or

00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:53,560

cool stuff like that and we'll announce

00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:06,349
those on Twitter and Facebook all right

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:13,819
so is anybody have any questions okay

00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:15,890
I'll pass the mic are there any

00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:17,810
automated tool sets for that are

00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,660
integrated with in Drupal to be able to

00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:22,910
do that kind of monitoring of once

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,560
you've got the SEO and one front end of

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,380
setting up to create the content and

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,730
also optimize it is there a module or

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,010
something that can kind of go in and

00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,150
using the crontab or something just kind

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:38,630
of go and check your ranking

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:41,630
periodically I'm actually not sure of

00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,640
anything on Drupal itself and because we

00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,800
do work on a lot of different platforms

00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,690
we tend to use third-party tools to do

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,510
that so that we got one place to go for

00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:53,329
all of our clients we had a quote from

00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:56,720
SEO Moz which is a really good resource

00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:58,099
in addition to just different articles

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,859
and white papers are there right they've

00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:03,140
got a whole suite of tools some of them

00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:05,030
are free and some of them are paid

00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,830
I know we've got a paid membership so

00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,050
we've got access to a lot of them but I

00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,180
think most of the viven the them were

00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,610
available is free they're just limited

00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,780
in what they can do and I'll let Stephen

00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:18,410
talk a little bit about those because

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:21,710
he's got more experience with them so a

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:24,770
lot of the different options I mean you

00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,850
can use with SEO Moz well the nice

00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:30,020
things with SEO ma's is they actually

00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:32,030
have their own independent Link Network

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,680
so they've actually done their own

00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,800
independent crawls and they're

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:42,710
essentially trying to be able to provide

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:46,160
a lot of the the authority that Google

00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:50,290
uses to determine kind of the the weight

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,250
the different links bring to a to a page

00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,840
they're actually trying to kind of

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,520
duplicate that work so that's one of the

00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,960
reasons we like to to do them is they

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,080
actually have some very powerful tools

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,900
to actually analyze all the incoming

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,600
links to your site what pages are going

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:10,790
to what the anchor text is on those

00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:13,430
links and also their estimate of how how

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,440
much authority is coming from that

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,380
particular link so that that's some very

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,540
powerful tools and it's a pretty

00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,870
reasonable thing for a professional

00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:26,690
membership for that so that that's

00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:29,630
actually pretty helpful they also will

00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:32,120
do you can do stuff like have ongoing

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,310
monitoring where you can track over a

00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,820
variety of keywords across a variety of

00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:42,500
search engines they also let you

00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:46,670
determine what region you're you are

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:50,140
appear to be for the search engine so a

00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:53,210
lot of a lot of lot of folks will

00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,910
particularly unscrupulous SEO folks will

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:58,120
say well you know you're appearing very

00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:01,990
high and you know your search engine on

00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:04,280
your home pc very good and you know

00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:06,170
click on your link twice a day and

00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,030
you'll rise up there because you know

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,680
they're logged into Google Google is

00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:12,130
trying to present what it perceives is

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:16,460
the best results for that person so

00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,970
regionally close websites are it assumes

00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,150
more

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:24,560
relevant and websites to click on are

00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:27,619
more relevant to you so actually using a

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,270
third-party service like SEO Maz is

00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:32,510
really helpful because you can say I

00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:34,670
don't want a regional skewing and

00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,369
they're pulling in so it's kind of

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,349
immune from a lot of that piece so that

00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:44,390
could be really helpful they also can do

00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:47,599
on page audits to let you know both

00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,940
potential keywords in a page and also

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,040
kind of the tagging of the page how its

00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,680
kind of set up and things like that so

00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,330
there are a lot of different options

00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:03,140
with some 3rd power tools like that that

00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:05,420
we we like you say we're at the

00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,210
University UNC Charlotte and we have a

00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,760
lot of subdomains and so google recently

00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,500
changed the way you know they didn't

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,840
want you to it's considered part of the

00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:17,840
main domain so I really wonder what your

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,580
experience was with subdomains and how

00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,589
interlinking within each other if

00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,660
there's any benefit to it there's

00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:26,060
there's not a lot of conversation about

00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,070
this topic and so we're wondering if

00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,020
it's of any effort for us to try to

00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:35,210
incorporate that cross-linking in there

00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:37,220
or really focus on the external so okay

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,130
I mean a lot of different search engines

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:44,330
treated differently I know early on what

00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:46,609
they would tend to do is give less

00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,010
credit for incoming lengths coming from

00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:50,690
the same class C because they assume

00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,070
that it's something like this or kind of

00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,930
less scrupulous that people would run

00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,960
their own link farms and if they did

00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:59,859
they would tend to be within you know

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,510
very isolated part of the IP space and

00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:04,730
so you didn't give as much credit for

00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,690
that and I know that's actually one of

00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,670
the things that some of the more

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,190
comprehensive backlink tools will tell

00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:12,560
you is not only just how many different

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:18,440
top-level domains but how many different

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:22,060
class sees so I think that as developers

00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:28,220
get more savvy that they're kind of

00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:31,070
being changing weather treating that

00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,290
and I'm not sure how much benefit you're

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:35,300
getting right now you know for hemming

00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,790
all in one versus having separate ones

00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,400
because there's some plus in that the

00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:42,349
larger the site it's one of the beliefs

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,210
the larger the site the more

00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,400
authoritative that most the search

00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,170
engines will see it but then again any

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,849
of your main sites are probably be

00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,619
fairly large to begin with and your

00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:54,440
sub-sites are probably getting me fairly

00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,869
large as well so you know it's it's kind

00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,320
of hard to tell but I'd say if you can

00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:02,720
do a lot with incoming links from other

00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,720
domains and other classies that's

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,390
probably going to do better for you even

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,520
though it's more work than just just

00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,830
focusing on cross looking between your

00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,440
sub domains but if for nothing else we

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:18,230
go back to the usability part and if you

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:31,310
think it's useful to your users then you

00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:34,359
should do it uh-huh okay right yep okay

00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,359
any other questions

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:01,160
it's the last one I thinking that's the

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,160
meta tag section

00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,760
No

00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,009
yeah in the description do you you

00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:29,349
always recommend we put note summary

00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:31,479
dallastx that is default so the the

00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:34,199
default with meta tags is node summary

00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:36,130
and I mean that's a good generic one

00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:40,630
because if you're filling out the node

00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:43,660
summary it's probably going to be an

00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,529
appropriate sort of meta description you

00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,369
know it's gonna be a summary of your

00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:52,299
article the one thing to keep in mind is

00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:56,650
you see the preferably 150 characters or

00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:58,359
less again if you have it longer than

00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,880
that Google is going to pick out the

00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:03,939
relevant parts so you can it can look

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,579
chopped whereas if it's under 150

00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:09,670
characters if Google decides that's the

00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:12,099
relevant description for that piece then

00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:14,949
it will look a lot more uniform so again

00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:19,229
if you've got content creators with the

00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:22,539
time to do it actually filling in a

00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:25,769
carefully crafted meta description is

00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:25,769
usually the better practice

00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:40,299
yeah it's one of these things is it's a

00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,920
balance it definitely doesn't have to be

00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:45,930
the summary you're always going to do

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:49,030
better if you have handcrafted has

00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:51,250
handcrafted titles handcrafted summaries

00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,319
rather than token base the other hand

00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:56,230
token-based is better than nothing at

00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:58,329
all so you know that's why its default

00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,460
at least even if you can't get your

00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:02,290
content creators to do this custom at

00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:08,049
least will be something and it's better

00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:11,140
than nothing but if you go down to the

00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:14,470
advanced the I guess past the Advanced

00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:17,650
Options there is a lot of different

00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,270
token options that you're able to to use

00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:24,700
through the meta tags module I mean

00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:29,920
probably 50 or 60 it's it's a lot okay I

00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:40,420
think we're about out of time here okay

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:43,720
there any other questions for someone

00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:45,880
working on sites especially in a small

00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:49,089
company do you recommend either of the

00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:54,730
10 there at least two SEO tools and SEO

00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:59,020
checklist for that I think a lot of it

00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:01,390
depends on your workflow if you're

00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,950
creating a lot of content and you know

00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,440
kind of getting pulled around to a lot

00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,540
of different things the checklist can be

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,920
handy because it's basically have you

00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:16,599
done this have you done that we don't

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:19,390
tend to use them because at least on the

00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:23,079
you know at least for our site because

00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:26,829
our workflow tends to be we like to

00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:30,160
review internally content before it's

00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:32,440
published and so once content is ready

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,799
for review one or the other of us will

00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:39,099
actually take the time to to review and

00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:41,500
do some keyword research and actually

00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:43,480
craft the Meta Description stuff like

00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,549
that so a lot of it depends on the

00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,949
workflow

00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:48,539
we've got some clients that are fairly

00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:51,449
large and so they actually have a review

00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:53,729
process built in so if if that is an

00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:58,349
appropriate workflow for the site then

00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:59,880
those can be handy but if not if you

00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:10,349
don't use it that it's just a module

00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:13,529
cluttering up your system do you have

00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:14,849
any experience with aqueous devcloud has

00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:17,309
these like built-in tools and one of

00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:19,979
them is like an SEO grader and

00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:23,489
experience so we've just started moving

00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:25,410
over to aqua and we don't yet have a

00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:28,380
site that we've had a chance to play

00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:30,509
with that on I'm looking forward to

00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,039
trying it out but I know it's out there

00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:33,150
and it sounds very interesting I just

00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:34,829
haven't had a chance to play with yet we

00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:38,309
just start moving like two or three

00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:40,859
months ago so I manage a website that

00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:42,719
has a funky acronym and it's pronounced

00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:45,029
haystack but it's spelled totally

00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,829
differently a che sta SI and I have a

00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:48,239
colleague who's like why don't we get

00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:51,269
this get all over the search term

00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:54,630
haystack like the word haystack and my

00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:56,549
my thinking was that is already a word

00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:58,229
in English and people look for that word

00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:59,279
mostly aren't looking for us although a

00:51:58,229 --> 00:52:02,130
lot of people don't know how to spell

00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:05,309
our name does it make sense to try and

00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:08,279
use that as a meta tag or put that

00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:10,979
somewhere so that's a that's a pretty

00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:14,009
interesting question a lot of times you

00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:17,999
used to find people would include

00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:22,589
potential misspellings and stuff in in

00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:25,140
their meta description or in different

00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:26,969
parts of their site Google is actually

00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,609
pretty good these days it's saying I

00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:33,329
think you meant this so I do is I'd

00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:36,059
actually I would actually see what

00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:39,209
happens if you took haystack spelled

00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,199
like the English word and maybe one or

00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:41,759
two other keywords that might be

00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,849
appropriate to your organization and see

00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:45,929
if google is able to figure that out

00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:48,949
because if google is able to figure it

00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:52,170
out then I think that'd probably be okay

00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:54,630
so i would check that first because

00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:57,010
ideally you want to be found by things

00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:00,319
that are appropriate and

00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,940
it's possible it might be interpreted

00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:07,119
that you're trying to be found by a term

00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:10,369
that is not relevant to your site and

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,050
and so there could be a penalty involved

00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:13,339
with that so I would I would see if

00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,040
google is able to figure it out on its

00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:18,589
own the other option would be to to

00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,800
actually have on your site into your

00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:25,760
site contact content well you know you

00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,369
know yeah this this is pronounced

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:32,060
haystack and you know lots of times

00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:34,220
people make this mistake one thing just

00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:37,220
a quick aside for keyword research if

00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:40,099
you've got something that people are

00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,420
finding your site for it might be

00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:44,089
something you could write some content

00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,319
about that to improve if particularly if

00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:47,380
folks are finding your site and finding

00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:50,869
some value in it now if you've got

00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,670
analytics Google Analytics or if you're

00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:55,460
looking through your your log analysis

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:57,109
software and and saying wow this is kind

00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,700
of odd people are finding me for this

00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:01,280
but I'm unintentionally optimized for

00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:02,900
that it's an appropriate something for

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:08,150
people to find by I might as well write

00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:15,440
some more content about that so any

00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:16,940
other questions look at what the top

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,770
keywords were and the copy and paste

00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,450
them and put them in the keywords which

00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,670
is kind of it seems self-defeating that

00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:25,160
Google already knows about that and then

00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,930
they exceed you know the 20 30 keywords

00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,250
in there and none of them are really

00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:32,210
relevant to the page that they're on

00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:33,109
they need to improve their so they

00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,359
that's it's kind of an interesting

00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:37,310
problem on a couple different levels one

00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:40,220
your analytics you really have a chicken

00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:41,599
or egg problem right because this is

00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,400
what people are finding your site for it

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,770
not necessarily what the people that are

00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,050
searching for your site are using so

00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,640
that's that's your first problem second

00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,700
problem actually putting it in your meta

00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,210
keywords tag is essentially useless

00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:58,849
because all you're doing is saying to

00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:01,250
anyone who's maybe auditing your site as

00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:03,190
a competitive analysis here are some

00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:08,400
terms I'd really like to be found for

00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:12,570
because Google does not use those at all

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:17,670
um I think being in yahoo used them very

00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:21,630
very slightly but Google categorically

00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:25,500
does not use the meta keywords at all so

00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:27,060
there's no use in doing that from from

00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:32,420
you know the majority of your search

00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:32,420
traffic so yeah it's got two areas there

00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:43,620
yep we like to try and set up goal

00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,590
tracking and analytics to say okay what

00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:49,080
what is what it what do you want people

00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,240
doing your site okay so isolated that

00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:55,170
behavior now let's see what keywords are

00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,610
actually converting people and then you

00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,810
can say okay well maybe those are the

00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,250
ones that are important not this one

00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:01,350
that we're getting lots of traffic for

00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,440
and they immediately leave that's

00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:06,630
perhaps not very helpful it just

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,520
addition on meta keywords I think it was

00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,680
probably maybe in the mid-90s that

00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,450
search engines stopped using meta

00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,480
keywords and we all know why because

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,850
it's just so easy to try to game the

00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,530
system because users don't see him and

00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:21,990
you could just stuff anything you wanted

00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:24,060
to enter them to the point that when

00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:26,430
Google came around they realized they

00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,690
weren't useful and according to matt

00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:33,570
cutts one of their lead spokespeople

00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:36,270
google has never used meta keywords for

00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:38,190
placement though the one thing they are

00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:40,470
useful for and you could do it in other

00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:43,410
ways is if you're running your own site

00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:46,320
search you're allowed to game it however

00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,480
you want to and if there is a phrase

00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,700
that you want a page to be found by even

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,360
though that text isn't there you could

00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,360
make the medic

00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:01,170
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:03,120
ago we could not have imagined that

00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,340
asterisk would not only become the most

00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,470
widely adopted open source communication

00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,510
software on the planet but that it would

00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:12,030
impact the entire industry in the way

00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:14,010
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:16,650
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:18,600
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,670
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,110
transition of power from the hands of

00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,360
the traditional proprietary phone

00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:26,760
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,830
administrators of phone systems using

00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,480
this power our customers have traded all

00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:32,580
sorts of business changing applications

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,380
from small office phone systems to

00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,480
mission-critical call centers to

00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,310
international carrier networks in fact

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,750
there's even an entire country those

00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:42,030
communications infrastructure runs on

00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:44,160
esters the gym has always been about

00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,870
creating technology that expands

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,030
communications capabilities in ways that

00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:49,230
we could never have imagined and that's

00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,630
part of what's game-changing about

00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:54,330
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:56,400
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,530
IP phones that extends control of the

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,300
user all the way to the desktop the

00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:02,010
launch of these new products represents

00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,960
the next phase indigenous history of

00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:06,510
innovation these are the first and only

00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,220
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,900
power of masters when we first discussed

00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,790
our expectations for building a family

00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,950
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,690
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:17,310
the team to build the phones such that

00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,530
they were easy to install integrate

00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,360
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:23,940
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,560
that goal user feedback is validating

00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,660
that when it comes to operation with

00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,090
astro space systems including our own

00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,670
switchvox based product these are the

00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,990
easiest to use best integrated most

00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:36,570
interoperable products on the market

00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:38,550
today the digitally phones will

00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:40,620
initially include three IP des hommes

00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,440
uniquely designed to complement any

00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,430
asterisk or switch box base solution

00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,100
these phones are different for a number

00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:49,740
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,180
designed for use with esters secondly

00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,790
we've made it really easy to

00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:55,170
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:57,270
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:59,190
to access information inside of asterisk

00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:00,210
allowing tight coupling between the

00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,790
application and

00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:04,950
phone additionally we've created an

00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:07,080
applications engine that allows users

00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,660
and developers to create and run their

00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,730
own apps on the following and finally

00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:13,800
we've done all of this at a very

00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,480
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,280
always thinking of ways to give our

00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,650
customers the best value in business

00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,540
phone systems and also give them the

00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,670
power to create their own solutions or

00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,560
eating communications challenge well

00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,240
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:29,250
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,900
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:33,390
asterisk and what communications even

00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:37,070
easier and together we'll change the way

00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:37,070
the world communicates again

00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:54,309
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:56,469
way to better utilize all your resources

00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:59,949
and it makes managing all your resources

00:59:56,469 --> 01:00:03,779
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:07,269
happening in open source the

01:00:03,779 --> 01:00:09,069
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:11,199
of the community and the speed at which

01:00:09,069 --> 01:00:13,180
these are these you know these these

01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:15,459
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,339
discovered and then fixed is it I think

01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:21,339
that really shows the power of the of

01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:23,789
the open source community it is global

01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:27,339
and it's definitely because of the users

01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:33,219
community people are extremely friendly

01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:35,019
and always ready to help if you go an

01:00:33,219 --> 01:00:37,239
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:00:35,019 --> 01:00:39,880
helping each other out and they're all

01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:41,559
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,579
product is transparent for everyone

01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:47,769
everyone can look at the code base

01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:49,979
everyone can see how cloud tech is being

01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:55,479
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:58,089
everything is open in many ways it's

01:00:55,479 --> 01:01:02,589
absolutely vital to the the unborn

01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:06,789
health plan stack the most exciting

01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:09,630
event in recent memory for he was our

01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:12,269
first developer boot camp

01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:14,910
and our call gave people a gave me two

01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:18,869
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:23,039
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:25,890
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,410
chairs in the room twice everything

01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:31,680
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:34,740
is open source and so I don't think that

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,660
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:40,109
sources not pervasive in cloud computing

01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:42,269
and so i think it's i think it's an

01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:43,769
assumption i think when you talk about

01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:48,599
cloud computing you're really talking

01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:50,880
about open source cloud computing cloud

01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,640
sac is a robust solution for large

01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,039
deployments you have dozens of data

01:01:53,640 --> 01:02:00,059
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:03,329
data centers these hardware is going to

01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:06,539
fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:09,029
handle number one that mass scale number

01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:11,730
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:14,579
that inevitably happens in large

01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:18,809
deployments we started working on kosdaq

01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:22,079
over four years ago and it was the

01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:23,849
original set of people working on it had

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,960
a background of delivering software

01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:32,190
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:35,819
lots of users actually using it high

01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:38,880
availability is the key feature multiple

01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:41,069
hypervisors support different network

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,069
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:02:41,069 --> 01:02:45,839
better while step management server can

01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:49,529
be deployed in different physical

01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,180
machines it definitely has a huge

01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:56,190
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:58,769
there's a major movie studio that they

01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:02,069
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:04,049
to transcode video and i thought that

01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:05,670
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:08,940
more fascinating is what they did during

01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:11,730
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,109
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,800
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:19,230
the instances and get back to doing

01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,730
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:22,620
different aspects and there's no one

01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:25,580
person that's kind of like a master of

01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:29,070
all those realms I think CloudStack as a

01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:31,290
project is going to be one of the

01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:35,340
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:40,770
most feature fallen and and robust

01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:43,700
platforms out they were Adam senior
