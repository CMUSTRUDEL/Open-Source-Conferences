welcome to the desktop to desktop to

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,570

have any questions any time along the

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,309
way it's more conversational I have any

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,620
problem with that as we move forward as

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,719
I said you can you can creditors read

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,399
that media current it's a small shop out

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,270
of Alpharetta Georgia just say to you 30

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,739
30 minutes or so 45 minutes from Atlanta

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,490
you can reach me by my handle thing

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,950
master on Twitter so here's some of the

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,030
key assumptions i have if you're

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,189
familiar with using the views module you

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,299
know this session is for you if you're

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,390
familiar with fields and content types

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:26,700
i'm assuming that you understand the

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,159
basic concepts of theming like you know

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:35,909
we won't go to very detailed overview of

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,610
teaming i'm also assuming you understand

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,520
how to install Drupal modules the basics

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,439
that type of thing and this is now if

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,180
you've used panels this is not a panels

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:51,329
bashing session but with that said it's

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,540
kind of like panels and display sweet

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,790
they kind of you know panels been around

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,390
for a long time it you know it's very it

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,060
you know it has its its charm but you

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,790
know the face-off between these two they

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,060
don't have to be a conflict conflict of

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,739
interest you can use both or any given

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,900
site these are just different

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,900
methodologies for displaying data

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,110
because you know who I'm rooting for in

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:26,430
this and that and out that battle and I

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:31,920
think he wanted to this side note but

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:34,409
they can't get along that's it okay one

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,329
of the purposes of display street is to

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,579
allow you to take full control over the

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,799
you are and using the drag drop

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:43,799
interface I similarly panels more or

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:47,190
less you can arrange nose views comments

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:49,859
user data without having to work through

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,299
dozens of templates template files

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,040
you're not to create you don't have to

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:56,280
even though you you can you don't have

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,260
to do that with with display sweet it's

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,409
packaged with predefined list of layout

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,590
similar to panels you no no no big thing

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:07,409
there you can add to it as well it's

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,260
created by or the modules maintained and

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:14,909
written about Christoph Yeager or de

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,870
Jager how many you would you know count

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:21,389
yourself as hardcore Jupiter's you did

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,569
this young you you're hardcore do blur

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,340
okay well let's just see he now he has a

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,859
group of tattoo how many guys have a

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,919
group of tattoo nobody has to dupe

00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,750
attack well yes she guess you can't

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,260
count yourself as being hardcore right

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,389
you know anyway he he's um he's a pretty

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,150
good guy I never met him but from what I

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:45,030
understand he is he's very good at what

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,799
he does crowd so give him credit and I

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,079
wouldn't go as far as getting the tattoo

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,159
but I can understand he's dedicated you

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,750
know you want those people on your team

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,690
give me give you a few statistics about

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,739
display sweet and one thing when a

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:06,750
highlight is mainly out of nine thousand

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:09,720
you know 728 modules this is ranking 113

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,269
in that list so what that tells me is

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,159
that hey this is popular or is gaining

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:21,090
ground it has some some staying power so

00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:23,100
too so to speak eighty-four thousand so

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,160
my downloads

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,260
and you know 21,000 installs operating

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,430
in style so it's gaining ground is

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,740
pretty good pretty good module you know

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,020
so panels versus display sweet some of

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,540
the now if you notice at the bottom of

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,910
the screen I put the sauce here now and

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,220
I'll post this on SlideShare so everyone

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:49,680
can download this from the from the

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,320
Charlotte a dark side but some of the

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
key differences is that you know this

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,810
place we always starts with the single

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,770
object such as a no or you know comic

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:04,020
you know comment or or something you

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,930
know in that range and it offers a way

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,160
to configure the display by rearranging

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,520
fields for for for the note that has

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,820
forefront it starts with a file it goes

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,140
up to a five column system basically

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,180
what i'm trying to say panels is also

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,610
focused on combining different objects

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,470
such as blocks knows views and etc

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,890
together in a variety of variety of

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,600
layouts as mentioned Pennell pages offer

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,370
the option to change the layout and

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,020
layout of the detail page of a no and

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,980
you have the option to create several

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:49,250
variants based on the argument now you

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:53,460
know that being said display sweet

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,160
doesn't quite you know have the variant

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,650
option that panels does where you can

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,250
pass in I mean you can kind of simulate

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,260
it by creating coalfields and using coal

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,850
fields and we get to that in a minute to

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,470
kind of do the same thing but it's not

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:12,690
quite light panels in that way you know

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,710
you could just displace me you can

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:20,550
define layouts or what they call no

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:23,100
details or view modes basically to take

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,110
the arguments and we can go through that

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,790
little bit later and one thing about

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,250
panels versus display sweet is that

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,060
panels is restricted to one level of

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,700
grouping what that means is you with

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,950
display sweet you can use

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,040
contributed modules like from Phil

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,100
groups and you can group your data using

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:50,370
that same module inside of the same node

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:54,970
so you know that's that's one benefit

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:58,620
key concepts vemos this is this is very

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,220
important because those are different

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,860
you know how are you how you configure

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,470
the in the end displayed that that will

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,510
be called your view mode so that's very

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,030
important concert will go through these

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:17,260
and I have a example so to show you as

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:21,250
we as we move forward coalfields is very

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:24,240
important you can add custom PHP to you

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:28,000
know you from cousin PHP two blocks to

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,680
anything that you that Drupal runs in

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,290
this bootstrap you can run through a

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,860
cold field basically a different flavors

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:40,090
of the coalfield styles you can add

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:44,560
custom styles to at the field level and

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:48,850
also at the region of them so what if

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,420
you Mo's again vemos are another name

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,850
for layouts and display sweet they can

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,280
control how the page will render via

00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,840
templates so you can it comes with

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,060
default templates but you can also

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,920
override that and use cut your own

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,530
custom Timbers similar light panels

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,790
really panels and displaces the display

00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:12,730
sweet use the same see tools module to

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,100
generate the display so you know you

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:19,960
really when we go through the steps you

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,910
create a new display sweet layout new

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:31,600
layout the same way you would more or

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:34,479
less panels that make sense so you know

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,110
one last point unlike penalize a module

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,599
you can't manage display the managers

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,370
play the site excuse me the display size

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,010
placement of regions to the you are

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,940
although user CSS it is possible to

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,300
choose the same results like 10

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,420
you can move around the you can move

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,880
around the region's easier you know that

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,990
you can move around the content a lot

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,200
easier in the display panel display

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,930
suite is more where you really can't

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,050
move the region's as easily without

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,310
going to the CSS and doing it I mean it

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,250
you'll see later once you get into the

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,660
you are even though you can do it to CSS

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,770
but it's just not quite the same

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,310
paradigm so what a and please stop me if

00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:26,360
you guys have any questions of any time

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:30,170
so what a cold feels again cold Phil is

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,920
a way to it's like you could think of it

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:39,860
like cck but it they have very various

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,710
options for you to add blocks or you

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,290
know just you know hand coded PHP

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:48,170
directly and make it a feel make it a

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,350
fillable data that you can then put into

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:56,960
your node or comment or whatever entity

00:09:51,350 --> 00:10:01,600
is attached to again you can access any

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,600
variable that the theme layer can access

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,710
same thing styles.css basically how to

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,160
get custom CSS classes on each region

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,290
and feel that gives you away so let's

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,890
just get to kind of installing it you

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,710
know used rush you guys used rush I know

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,570
you guys using the last session um drush

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,860
is pretty good you just downloaded the

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:30,500
machine name is d s displayed sweet one

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,860
of the things that really point out here

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,860
is when you download it make sure you

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,560
install the display sweet but the extras

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,330
is whether give you a lot of power when

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,370
you go into starting to manage the site

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,550
it has a lot of built-in capabilities

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,700
forms something you know if your

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,970
designer I'm a designer by trade but in

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,830
my nature so you know one thing when

00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,880
you're building a site for a client

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,150
sometimes you know

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,640
about is the UI the forms that they were

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,790
putting their data what the spray sweet

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,220
gives you ability to even customize at

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,370
that level not just what's publicly

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,180
presented but also was probably managed

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,820
so you you turn on the forms display you

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,040
could manage that and also search it

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,820
works it integrates well with even solar

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,620
Apache Solr if you guys you guys work

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,860
with that it works with the default

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:38,960
Drupal API and apache solr so it's

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:40,750
pretty versatile again you know so i'm

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,980
going to show you the example this but

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,780
that one way because many ways

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,940
especially when you install the extra

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,770
that you can get to you start using

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,680
display sweet but the one place you go

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,700
is under structure because it's counted

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:59,630
as a structural element is it would be

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,510
in that list the same place where views

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,390
are you know that same lesson you you

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,130
know you click on display sweet and then

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,640
in that list you'll see several

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,280
different elements you see the fields

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,350
that's where you put your custom fields

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,320
layouts that's deep the types of layouts

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,800
that you are provided by the system

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,030
styles the obviously the CSS and the

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,800
view modes is where you can select the

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,690
manage or create new view modes and

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,300
attach them to entities which it will be

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:41,810
like knows or comments or user or

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:43,970
profile whatever yes exactly vemos it

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,390
you can you can attach those do those

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:51,130
different entities to two different

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,130
pieces at their Matthew

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:09,000
well now if you this is displace we

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,220
allow will allow you but you can use

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,890
custom coalfields to manage the

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,870
different display you know from mobile

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,589
the different mobile types but this

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,170
mainly is to just manage your in an

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,459
intelligent way to manage your you are

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,980
and different components without

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:28,800
creating extra templates to custom

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,750
templates and overrides to manage the

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:41,910
placement of elements on the page that

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:44,970
makes sense no it doesn't do that by

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,279
default um you know and my title is a

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,450
little bit misleading that there is I

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,970
have I use and I'm familiar with this

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,790
but Omega you heard of make a team okay

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,550
okay well I have an example of an Omega

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,899
team okay and Omega you you know that's

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:06,600
it is it's built for responsive design

00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:10,200
okay meaning responsive meaning that it

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,730
knows using media queries what the side

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,470
you know what's the size of your browser

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:18,120
and then it does it adds style sheets

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,940
based on that and it rearranges it

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,430
changes the grid structure based on you

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:28,110
know the device that you're using so

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:31,079
that's what our that's why i will use in

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,779
conjunction with this to to create a

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,360
mobile-friendly site that makes sense

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,760
and i can show you an example of when I

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:46,110
do responsive design and the grid and

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:48,930
all that stuff like that so what this

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,079
example of a vm oh and i will walk you

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,980
through in the demo how to create a view

00:14:52,079 --> 00:15:01,529
of view mode and how to attach it to

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:09,749
entity or attach it to I guess

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:12,720
piece of of content in Drupal and you

00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:14,160
know this is where you just if you go

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,100
through the process and edit your

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,230
content type and you go to at the bottom

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,970
you'll see the display see once you

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:27,059
install it there's a there is a you know

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,269
a custom you know display setting where

00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,829
you pick the layout that you're

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,889
interested in using and then here this

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,809
is where you start to add your your

00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,309
different bill modes which is like oh I

00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,249
want a different display for the teaser

00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:44,430
oh I want a different display for the

00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:46,529
the no full view versus you know this is

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,300
what it looks like in search type of

00:15:46,529 --> 00:16:02,670
thing you you can go through and change

00:15:48,300 --> 00:16:06,809
it I context if you use if you use

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,939
context mobile tools there's a module

00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:15,110
called mobile tools that will allow you

00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:17,430
you are you familiar with context okay

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,050
when I'll show you I'll show you where

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:25,860
where it is and how kind of how it works

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:29,759
there is a way to but you you context is

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,350
a way and it replaces Drupal's block

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,939
management system for me with block

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:37,589
system Drupal's block management system

00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,209
like you go to the block overview blocks

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,870
overview and then to show all the blocks

00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,639
on that you have available to you okay

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,029
all right well that's that's why I can

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,660
show you that once we get to this coming

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:53,579
up soon you can use but what's called

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,429
mobile tools and it will give you the

00:16:53,579 --> 00:17:01,370
ability to select your different device

00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:01,370
and show different pieces depending

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,980
how do you add custom layouts custom

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,740
layouts it's written like again this is

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:17,309
built doll four ce tools he uses the

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:20,159
same paradigm more or less but the

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,409
simple way straightforward ways you know

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,990
you create a function and it's a dot I

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:27,240
include file and I'll show you on my

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:34,409
local environment where it lives that

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:36,929
lives directly under the you know the in

00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:39,210
the theme folder directly at the top you

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,610
don't you know don't don't divide it out

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,940
in anymore don't organize it anymore you

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,559
just you just put your your DS layouts

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,480
folder there and then that's where you

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,299
put all your layouts that type of thing

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,669
and then inside of if this particular

00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:56,220
I've chosen to do an article custom

00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,159
article layout you know you you create

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,789
your function and then add your regions

00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:09,330
in an array and you move you know you

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:11,400
manage it that way saying you know this

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,610
is just basic this year says that you

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,700
add well if you add a CSS file and you

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,260
name it you know articles dot CSS here

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,850
to pick it up automatically and that's

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:26,909
where you will manage your styles and

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:29,309
this is the template structure you know

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:31,169
that and I'm using html5 and that's why

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:37,679
you see section and you know different

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:41,630
the different entity elements so let me

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:47,610
get through so i'm going to show you a

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:51,000
good example of this month's we this is

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:54,600
well inside of that article content type

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,610
you will select your layout and by

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,020
adding that new letters show once you

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,169
clear your cache you just show at the

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,510
bottom and you can start using it so to

00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,730
the demo part so i can i'm gonna walk

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,450
you through and i'm assuming how many

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:14,880
guys used views everybody knows room use

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:17,330
geez ok so i'm going to show you how you

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,330
would go about

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:30,370
okay well let's see it too I can't

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:36,790
see that King you guys see that is it I

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:42,820
could change the color need be alright

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:45,610
so me let's just go now this is what

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:49,890
you're this is using mobile tools I'm

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:52,690
just what while I'm here this is kind of

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,790
one of the ways that you can kind of

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,300
trick the system to you can add a cold

00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:02,160
field and then you can put this you know

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:05,260
this function in there to the tech which

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:10,720
which display you're on to show a piece

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:13,990
of the the you know the that that field

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,930
that particular field but for for so I

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,880
created a view this is a view that

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,040
displays on the front page and typically

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,190
you know we all get these views and then

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,410
unformatted more or less right so i just

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,060
created a generic view and pull back and

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,910
users of styles and pull back these

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,520
images so what if i wanted to let's say

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,860
put the image you know float damage to

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,930
the left and put the content on the

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,310
right and you know the typical the

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:44,880
designer ething right what you would do

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,880
is for one

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:57,730
you would go through and you would in in

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,030
your view there's a show right as this

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,370
on the formatting and you click on that

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,340
and if you install the module you'll see

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:11,200
that there is a display sweet option

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:14,770
right so you apply that to this view and

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,169
this is your view mo you know I'm just

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,390
to say i'ma call it teaser you know well

00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:22,480
you know it's it dis is pre is built in

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:25,150
but I'm a select ok I want you to use

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,190
the default tease of you and you go

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:32,730
ahead and you apply you apply that right

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,490
so it's not as its I have to say that

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,690
now you'll notice what k well it's

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,740
nothing has changed so what you have to

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:44,380
do because you have to go in and this

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,169
this was sure if you turn on the extras

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,470
and turn on all those options you'll see

00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:53,020
that manage display will appear as one

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,230
of the options to you know to manage to

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,659
display and you would go in and you

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,210
would say okay well right now they're

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,950
stacked so what I want to do you can see

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,840
the custom when I add and I'll show you

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,669
that in the code where is that but you

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:13,809
can say well I want I want two columns

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:15,520
right and I want that to be and this is

00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,919
the you notice now this is on the

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,470
article content type and you see a

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,440
managed display manage feels that's what

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,080
the administrator see and manage display

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:31,090
is what the public sees so you say

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:34,799
manage two columns and you say that so

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:37,059
oh well not nothing there and go back

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,419
and we'll go back again because I have

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:41,799
to actually add now I have to place

00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,440
content in those different regions you

00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:47,230
see that at the top is right and the

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,799
left and this could be you know it's the

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:55,390
same thing for all the other layout so

00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:57,659
I'm going to add the image to the left

00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,659
right

00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:03,570
and I'm going to find I'm going to go in

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:07,859
here and find the body raises bud okay

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm go add that to the right right and

00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:14,999
I'm going to add the title to the right

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,799
so i'ma go up here so I have that you

00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:21,440
know obviously you can r you can arrange

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:24,119
them but that's the basic setup right

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,460
this is there more length in here oh

00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,729
that's a read more link i want to add

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:33,809
that to the to the right i'm going to

00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:39,509
put that directly up under the body

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:42,799
that's that's a common workflow so I'm

00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:47,779
save dad so what you should see is now

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:49,950
you have that same layout for that view

00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:55,320
it's connected to the view so you can

00:23:49,950 --> 00:24:02,820
manage the views back and forth you know

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:07,349
and if i switch teams this is the Omega

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:12,589
team if i switch teams and I say okay I

00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:12,589
want um oops and go back to

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,250
you

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,850
okay so you still it's still maintained

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,770
you know maintain this is the grid this

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,809
is what I was telling you about the

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,030
responsiveness and see the greatest

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:42,480
automatically turn it on but see artists

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:46,140
great changes so I changes that's tablet

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,280
view and that's a mobile you so and you

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,870
still see that lay out there now you can

00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,860
because you know that there are some

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,900
options here you can you can have you

00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,700
can go in here and alter this code and

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,300
add cold feels to have certain things

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:07,410
switch out and i'ma show you an example

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:11,280
of a cold feel how you add a custom a

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:13,290
custom field here to this display so

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,660
it's several ways you can do it let me

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,540
just go back to the example I put in the

00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:28,100
slides earlier so you get idea so I want

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:32,400
to add a custom code right I have some

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:35,340
some examples here so if you wanted to

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,700
add this is called a cold field this is

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:45,240
where you add your PHP i'm going to edit

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:47,640
that you see everything whether you you

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,940
can attach you figured you you figure

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,950
out which where this particular variable

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,290
you want where it's coming from whether

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,860
it be the no object or it could be

00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:01,290
taxonomy a user DS views or you know

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:04,830
comments but everything how you write it

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:07,320
out will be that this place we uses

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,760
entity and that's that's the route I

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,920
guess the root of your object that's

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,990
that's where it starts so no matter if

00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,660
it's a comment or whatever it's just

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:18,150
entity and then you start your class

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,190
structure from that point on to print

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,559
your data I just chose to do something

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,950
simple like entity name which because I

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,770
have it attached to the note object so

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,350
and i'ma save that and you know this is

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:34,170
important you this is displayed sweet

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:38,120
coated ads or text formatting feel

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,120
automatically when you install

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:47,640
I think data private thing I think it's

00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:49,770
just the same thing they just make sure

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,440
that you know if you don't have that

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,360
enable because a lot of times on site to

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,669
tell you to disable that field for

00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,000
security reasons by Zeba I think they

00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:03,480
add their own so it's hakuna matata know

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,510
where he's right you know here's a cool

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,279
thing and I can show this you can you

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:23,250
can also work with tokens you know

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:26,850
absolute URL I just seen I'm just out of

00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:34,549
token there also you can say okay enable

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:38,730
tokens and you save that ok so that's

00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:40,890
that's that's the username so I'm gonna

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:44,370
what if I want to add that to to my

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:48,690
display what you do is you go back in

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:52,289
here let me show your alternate way to

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,510
get to it just so multiple ways to get

00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:56,490
there is very important on see you go

00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,320
here and you can go to the content type

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:09,029
and you manage display it's the same

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:11,490
same same Avenue and you know so I'm

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:13,590
going to I'm managing the teaser right

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,309
because that's what I attach that view

00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:20,100
so now i'ma go and i'ma find that

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:24,299
username and i'm going to add that to

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,429
the to the left so in theory we should

00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,440
get the username and we should get what

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:35,159
we're talking did I add I had to date

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:40,110
yeah I had added to date alright so so

00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:43,260
we have that to the left and put that

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,880
underneath the image I'm gonna show you

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,710
some of the cool things you can do that

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
the space week gives you the ability to

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,250
do without having to go create custom

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,460
you know code

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:58,470
so I'm gonna go back i'm derry i should

00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:02,760
see okay so i see i have my name and I

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:06,480
have you know the date the medium format

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,120
I think I put that in there so you see

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,920
that that's a custom custom code feel

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,570
that you can you know and anything that

00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:21,180
the system you know has an object you

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:23,280
can add directly that way let me go back

00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,440
here and say okay well you know I want

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,050
to add I want to what if I want to make

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,270
this you know I'm going to do some work

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,220
here to the body i'm going to change the

00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,080
tags around it i'm going to add a style

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:42,780
that type of thing so when you go back

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:49,170
here you manage it so that thing says

00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:52,520
wrap h2 now first like the for this to

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:55,350
work I'm gonna have to take that off I

00:29:52,520 --> 00:30:02,340
can link it but I'm to take that off

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:05,610
because I want to use the the field set

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,470
up and the extra seat gives you the

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,190
ability to do or what they call a full

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:14,220
reset it just rips all the HTML out and

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,440
it's just very simple you know minimum

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,570
it's the same thing you can it a strip

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,210
out the content but here's where i added

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:24,560
a custom style use one of the fields

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:30,180
that i'll show you later you can add a

00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:33,240
you know style there but the full expert

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:38,210
view is what what this comes with

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:41,550
display sweet so so you have just say

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:43,260
you can change the label here you can

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,970
change the outer wrapper i'll just say

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:51,020
you want to put that in to make that a

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:51,020
div and you want to give a class of

00:30:52,430 --> 00:31:00,030
test1 and let's just say you gave it a

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,490
rapper and you want to make it a list

00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,370
item so you put the list the beginning

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,280
of the

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,290
the list item right and you want to get

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:12,700
out of class I'm just call that t2 and

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,530
then you want to it so if you have a

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,360
list item you have to have the Li as

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:30,010
well so you can give that a t3 I'm gonna

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:35,940
update that Jeanette I mean let me just

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:38,200
do the let me just do the Firebug thing

00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,410
and then theory I should have some

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,280
classes here boo all right let me go

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,770
down you see that you have a the dev

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,700
that we added the test one we have the

00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:53,770
you UL element the list element and we

00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,450
have and all and all these elements have

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,550
the classes and we still have the

00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,380
benefit of having the link you know

00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:02,140
because we link that we click that check

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,630
mark so you can you know you can start

00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,660
to see the power of this this particular

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,480
you know module where you can I haven't

00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:14,110
added any any of the templates I'm just

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,120
doing it all to the UI I'm not um you

00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,490
can even add blocks whatever you know

00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,320
what if you have a custom viewer or you

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,559
know you want to add a block just to

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,140
this you know to this item here to this

00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,140
list here what you do is you go back

00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,820
that's the wrong way

00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:59,330
see that custom coalfields you say well

00:32:51,530 --> 00:33:03,080
I want to I want to add a dynamic excuse

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:05,799
me I'm going to add a block and you can

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,799
say i want that

00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:39,249
just pick default so I'm basically

00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:41,889
adding this block in go back in and man

00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:45,429
it should just play here so that's it

00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:53,049
right there you just add that to the

00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:56,009
left it should see that search bloc is

00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:58,299
added to each each query now you

00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:00,190
obviously this is not user friendly I

00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,749
mean you wouldn't want to do that but

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,480
you know you get the point that you can

00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:08,549
add a block you also can do a nice

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:12,940
that's a block field you also can add

00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:14,559
dynamic they call a dynamic field and

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,579
that's you know think it's just it's

00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:21,909
like panels and in this way go back here

00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:27,869
mind you see I'm editing the View mode

00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:31,559
and I'm on teaser and I'm gonna add a

00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,559
dynamic field here

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:55,710
no save that to go back here now notice

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:59,400
though you have to actually mean you

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:07,680
have to actually add there you have to

00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:10,860
select content to add to it it's just

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,510
like you might use panels okay so you

00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:17,850
see it's the same same scenario here

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:20,640
yeah because it really uses CTools

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:24,950
everything panels and display sweet uses

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:29,340
t tools you're building it ah was that a

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:33,420
date yeah Pat you write your page

00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:44,030
manager for this thank you for that

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:47,940
correction thank you so I'm at no note

00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:51,870
you know like no terms well I think I

00:35:47,940 --> 00:36:01,970
haven't well I think I do but you get

00:35:51,870 --> 00:36:01,970
you get the point so you update this

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:25,240
I don't think I have any oh I I didn't

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:28,500
able it here has seen go back here I'm

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,500
add that to the left as well

00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:41,550
mmm it's not quite working but I think

00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,310
you guys get the gist oh when I was

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:46,220
saying i'm here at this point you guys

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,220
have any questions on this I mean I'm

00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,220
going

00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:20,300
what's a good question this is a good

00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:22,640
question because it oh ok this good

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,210
question the question is at what point

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,450
does this using this place we come in

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:33,890
come into play for a designer / you know

00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:37,670
developer configuration am I you know

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:39,830
creating the design first and then using

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,080
this to configure or am I just using

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,490
this to do the configuration and

00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:49,190
creating design later is that correct

00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:52,010
it's at the ok so the catch-22 is that I

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,020
in ideal world in the wild greens world

00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:57,080
you would do the design and you would

00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:00,350
get everything you want to look you know

00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,150
the way you get the display in terms of

00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,220
just mock-ups you should get everything

00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:06,770
to look exactly the way you want and

00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:09,440
then you would configure it to meet your

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:13,040
design that's that's a walgreens world

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,800
but in the real world what happens often

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,780
is that you are working in the group in

00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,330
a team environment and you may get a

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,850
developer or you may get you know even

00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,010
you know I would say even a femur or

00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:28,370
somebody who's kind of configuring the

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:30,200
site to pass to you two things they may

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:33,080
be putting together they may put

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:38,390
together a view and it's okay here you

00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:41,060
go designer guy or gal a girl i'm done

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:45,650
i've put together my view make it look

00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:48,650
just like the mock-up ok well some of

00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:51,230
these you know that's when you go and

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,270
say okay well i'm going to now I need to

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,550
add a class here I need it you know move

00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:58,070
this over here that's where this comes

00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:00,350
in handy because you're now you're not

00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:03,500
doing as much code as you would like you

00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:05,450
to get to get a complex design you may

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,790
have to go in and create a few view

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:11,210
templates just to get it to look like

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,570
your markup so this is a way to kind of

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:19,480
bridge it does that answer your question

00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:19,480
so I would consider this a

00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:27,310
a middle ground for configuration

00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,620
specialist or developers and demers vet

00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,980
/ designers this is kind of a place

00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,560
where they can hand you dare finished

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,300
product in terms of you know I have all

00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,030
the content types built and everything's

00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,590
done and here's you know and you know

00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,510
you take it the rest of the way to do

00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,190
the rest of the day me and this is kind

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,940
of the middle ground this is a paradigm

00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:50,860
per se of theming because you know you

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,980
could do the same thing in panels or you

00:39:50,860 --> 00:40:03,870
can do custom implants any any other

00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:03,870
questions okay

00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:26,210
if I run into conflicts between the

00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:29,450
space wheat and any other modules um yes

00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:35,480
I think wonder they call the entity one

00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:41,150
module call no entity or something like

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:44,240
that it's um it's I think it's it's oh

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:47,900
it's something like that um it's um

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,369
sometimes it depends and that I'll run

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,260
into conflicts with that I can't give

00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:54,410
you a can't think of an exact example

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,200
but sometimes display sweet the because

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:02,869
it's managing the entity it creates it

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:13,430
throws bugs one one one point here let

00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:15,860
me show you this emergency it has the

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,720
ability for you to just kind of turn it

00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,200
off temporarily so you can debug

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:24,050
something and not kind of disabled

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,540
things temporarily so you can figure out

00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,670
what's going on I think know me I

00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,400
haven't directly run into this but I

00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:34,369
think the why this is dead is because if

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,750
you try to include a note inside of a

00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:40,250
note kind of it has a problem with with

00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,140
with rendering it I think that that's

00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:47,600
that's why this there I haven't used it

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:48,890
I had a need to use it but wish I can

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,530
answer that question a little bit better

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:54,430
but I don't know i don't i don't know of

00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:56,869
any known issues i do know that the

00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:59,960
developer is trying to get this as a

00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:03,109
part of Drupal core I know he's done

00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,840
started initiative I think he has a good

00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:09,830
shot at it you know based on what this

00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,380
is like a logical step to wet cck and

00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:15,530
views this is a logical bridge between

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,230
two it's not that difficult to really

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:22,210
understand it you know and it takes to

00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:25,190
all the complexity out of teaming you

00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,640
know just basic things you still have

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,359
you still would have

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:39,569
maybe create custom templates but this

00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:54,079
goes a long way so anybody have any any

00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:54,079
other any other questions are okay oh

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:06,150
that's a good question so does this

00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:07,859
place we use it does the space we use

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,630
features so you can push it to

00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:13,470
production or any other environment

00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:15,930
that's right okay yes it does I think we

00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:22,519
could probably it integrates with

00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:22,519
feature as well then we can create one

00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:31,220
it creates the layout let's see

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,619
see

00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:18,119
see that display sweet so these are

00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:21,779
these are the Styles settings I have to

00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:25,410
be honest I haven't used this very much

00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:27,390
in my normal production workflow even

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,519
though I know you know we're supposed to

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:33,809
be using features and searching but I

00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:44,959
haven't done it as often as I should but

00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:47,729
I do know it works more or less so and

00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:51,509
let's see I think there's one other item

00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:53,309
I wanted to think i may have cutter

00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:57,440
covered all the fields you guys want to

00:44:53,309 --> 00:45:02,900
know how to add the custom styles that

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:09,319
yes or no if not we could just wrap it

00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:09,319
okay all right um okay all right okay

00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:21,599
let's see so I'm go here so you have

00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:24,599
sometimes you have a need to add a

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,059
custom style per region you know without

00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:31,319
having to go to create a new template so

00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:37,619
I'm gonna call this class name this is

00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:44,130
the class name obviously in class class

00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:47,119
us and this is obviously the what you've

00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,119
seen it in the drop down

00:45:53,570 --> 00:46:00,630
okay this is per field because with

00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:03,750
displaced we you can also manage / field

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,120
data so you could if you have a feel and

00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,100
you want to you know give it column

00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,960
structure or do something creative with

00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,960
it you know you can do it that way too

00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,680
he's randomly

00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,019
oops

00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:41,359
I'm just named that one so let me get

00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:45,090
confused all right so let me say it down

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:47,250
so now we should have the ability if you

00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:49,950
go back in and you say okay i wanna i

00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:54,410
want to add something to that title yeah

00:46:49,950 --> 00:47:00,950
that's what i want to do is what you do

00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:00,950
so first you go find that title and oh

00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:11,599
it's the wrong way and cancel feel just

00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,599
by asking

00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:24,990
so that with the default and you get

00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:28,410
these full reset but mainly you can see

00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:30,589
where the class shows up for the field

00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:39,599
style or not that's the one I add it

00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:41,310
update and then go down here module you

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,700
know you can that you can add all these

00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:47,250
fields down here too but for the region

00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,560
you know the class the style i added for

00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:53,280
each per region you can say hey you know

00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:55,920
I want to add to class us to the left

00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:02,010
and also add that same class to the

00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:05,210
right and if it's done right I should be

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:05,210
able to inspect that

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:30,420
so that he added it at the class six and

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:33,210
then the region the DA's region on the

00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:37,230
left she added the class us to the left

00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:39,600
and it also added it to the right for

00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,330
themer this is I mean it saves you a lot

00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,800
of code because a lot of times

00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:46,110
especially if your honor if you're

00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,020
working in a team environment just just

00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,550
you needing those classes to just get

00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,500
something done sometimes you have to go

00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,880
back to the developer in some cases say

00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,650
cuz you add this and they're like man

00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,810
you know they have to go through and

00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,340
find AP you know fine figure out a way

00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,200
to get it in and in some cases you have

00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,150
to go through and figure out how to add

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,890
it but this is an easy way to get things

00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:09,960
that you know to get your classes in and

00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:12,870
not have to go fill it with code so you

00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,200
know that being said guys I really

00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:18,900
appreciate you this is where to go get

00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,120
help again I'm going to put this on the

00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,340
charlotte site make sure it's available

00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,320
for everyone if you need it right now i

00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,840
could just give it to you download it

00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,630
and email it to you but these are some

00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,700
helpful videos and walk through and as

00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:36,410
always you know don't forget to cut your

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,410
cash happy theme

00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:18,380
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:20,540
way to better utilize all your resources

00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,990
and it makes managing all your resources

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:27,820
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:31,339
happening in open source the

00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:33,140
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:35,060
of the community and the speed at which

00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:37,250
these are these you know these

00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,560
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,170
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,869
that really shows the power of the you

00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,490
know of the open source community it is

00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:50,690
global and it's definitely because of

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:57,020
the users community people are extremely

00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:58,910
friendly and almost ready to help if you

00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,220
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,950
guys helping each other out and they're

00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,630
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:08,619
the product is transparent for everyone

00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:11,810
everyone can look at the code base

00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:14,050
everyone can see how close that is being

00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:19,550
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:22,220
everything is open in many ways it's

00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:26,630
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:30,859
health cloudstack the most exciting

00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:33,650
event in recent memory for me was our

00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:36,319
first developer boot camp

00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:38,990
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,920
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:47,119
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:49,940
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,490
chairs into the room twice everything

00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:55,819
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:58,789
is open source and so I don't think that

00:51:55,819 --> 00:52:00,559
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:03,589
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:06,140
computing and so i think it's i think

00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:07,640
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,380
about cloud computing you're really

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,380
talking about a source cloud computing

00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:17,720
cloud sac is a robust solution for large

00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:20,089
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:24,049
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:52:20,089 --> 00:52:27,380
data center is these hardware is going

00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:30,619
to fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:33,079
handle number one that mass scale number

00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:35,809
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:38,690
that inevitably happens in large

00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:42,859
deployments started working on contact

00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:46,130
over four years ago and it was the

00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:47,900
original set of people working on it had

00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:52,010
a background of delivering software

00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:56,270
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:59,869
lots of users actually using it high

00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:02,960
availability is a key feature multiple

00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:04,970
hypervisors support different network

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,640
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,920
you better while step management server

00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,609
can be deployed in different physical

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,260
machines it definitely has a huge

00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:20,240
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:22,819
there's a major movie studio that they

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:26,029
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:53:22,819 --> 00:53:28,099
to transcode video and I thought that

00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:29,750
was terribly fascinating what I found

00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:33,020
more fascinating is what they did during

00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:35,809
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,160
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:37,700
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,880
the esta

00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:43,280
Susan go back to doing real work

00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,780
CloudStack is vast it touches so many

00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,670
different aspects and there's no one

00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,900
person that's kind of like a master of

00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:53,090
all those realms I think CloudStack as a

00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,340
project is going to be one of the

00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:59,420
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:04,820
most feature fallen and and robust

00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:07,750
platforms I hope they were out on senior

00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,750
living for the clouds dag

00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,630
you

00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:31,010
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,960
ago we could not have imagined that

00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,180
asterisk would not only become the most

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,310
widely adopted open source communication

00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,350
software on the planet but that it would

00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:41,870
impact the entire industry in the way

00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:43,850
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:46,490
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,440
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:50,540
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,920
transition of power from the hands of

00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,200
the traditional proprietary phone

00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,600
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,550
administrators of phone systems using

00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,780
this power our customers have created

00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,700
all sorts of business changing

00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,560
applications from small office phone

00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,080
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,670
the international carrier networks in

00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,470
fact there's even an entire country

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,080
those communications infrastructure runs

00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:14,000
on esters the gym has always been about

00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,710
creating technology that expands

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,870
communications capabilities in ways that

00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,070
we could never have imagined and that's

00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,470
part of what's game-changing about

00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:24,170
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:26,240
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:28,370
IP phones that extends control of the

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,110
user all the way to the desktop the

00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,850
launch of these new products represents

00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:33,920
the next phase indigenous history of

00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:36,350
innovation these are the first and only

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,060
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,590
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,630
our expectations for building a family

00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:43,790
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,530
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,150
the team to build the phones such that

00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:49,370
they were easy to install integrate

00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:51,200
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:53,780
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,400
that goal user feedback is validating

00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,530
that when it comes to operation with

00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,930
astro space systems including our own

00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:02,510
switchvox based product these are the

00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,830
easiest to use best integrated most

00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:06,410
interoperable products on the market

00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:08,380
today the Digium family of phones will

00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:10,460
initially include three IP des hommes

00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,380
uniquely designed to complement any

00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,270
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,940
these phones are different for a number

00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:19,580
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,020
designed for use with esters secondly

00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,630
we've made it really easy to

00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,010
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:27,110
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:29,030
to access information inside of asterisk

00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,480
allowing tight coupling between the

00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,420
Alpha

00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,790
and the phone additionally we've created

00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,920
an applications engine that allows users

00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:40,160
and developers to create and run their

00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,930
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,880
done all of this at a very compelling

00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,560
price point at digium we're always

00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,660
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:50,180
the best value in business phone systems

00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,770
and also give them the power to create

00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,900
their own solutions or any

00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,640
communications challenge will continue

00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,109
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,090
Astros cooler bastard more

00:56:57,109 --> 00:57:00,859
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:03,410
asterisk and communications even easier

00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:06,910
and together we'll change the way the

00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:06,910
