00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
would like to thank the following

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,970
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,560
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,690
my name is matthew Connaughton am a

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,800
freelance developer and consultant up in

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,110
Asheville North Carolina I am going to

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,590
talk about rapid Jubal development which

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,300
is really more rapid rupal deployment

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,550
with regards to what we're going to be

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,230
talking about tonight with the features

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,199
module and a bunch of other modules we

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,329
can use so let's jump right in what is a

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,870
feature as defined by the features

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,750
module it's a collection of components

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,280
that satisfy a use case so if I think

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,650
about I want to create an events

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,500
calendar for my website well i got the

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,000
events content type the different cck

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,760
fields maybe some images and image

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,100
presets from image cache I got the views

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,540
that display um the dependencies on the

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,520
calendar and date module the context for

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,350
laying out the blocks on the side of the

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,500
calendar that I want to show all of this

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,060
creates one thing an events calendar so

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,250
when you go to create your events

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,630
calendar you have to manually go in and

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,430
click all this well what features does

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,950
is that let you gather all this together

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:44,579
and pull it together into a single

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:46,470
module that you can call the events

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,810
module and what you could do is you can

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,689
take this module and put it on a drupal

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,430
site any drupal site you want and when

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,320
you turn it on it will automatically

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,869
create all those different components

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,079
for you so right away you're saving that

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,860
first X amount of hours of sight

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,899
clicking um like I said a freelance

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,129
developer and so I'm working with lots

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,750
of different clients and really i'm

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,000
building the same websites over and over

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,670
again they want to news they want a blog

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,410
section a photo gallery

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,470
all these different things and what

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,330
makes it easier for me to get the

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,640
website out there faster and provide a

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,560
lower cost is it doesn't take me as long

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,720
because I use features I dropped the

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,880
photo gallery feature in there I dropped

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,290
the news section feature I drop the blog

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,310
feature i dropped the events calendar

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,080
feature so that's in a nutshell what the

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,900
futures module does thank you everybody

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,880
for coming we'll see now I so the

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,800
differences between modules that are

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,959
created by features and regular Drupal

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,760
modules are these three points at the

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,090
bottom the code is generated it's not

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,310
written by hand when you click to create

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,989
a feature button it's creating that code

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,530
for you and it's going to pop download

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,120
link and say here's your drupal module

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,040
these features are collecting

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,290
functionality versus with the drupal

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,840
module you're creating new functionality

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,840
or hooking into other modules to tie

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,760
functionality together and a great thing

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,620
about features is they're fantastic for

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,760
beginners people who aren't developers

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,680
really don't know how to create an

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,390
events calendar from scratch you can say

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,549
well you know just go over to this

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,260
feature server download this module and

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,600
you have an events calendar you have a

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,820
photo gallery you have a real estate

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,890
slideshow listing module so there's two

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,450
reasons you can use features these

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,579
aren't the two only reasons but these

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,350
are two main reasons one is going to be

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,209
for fast and easy we use of code if

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,130
you're building a lot of websites for a

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,959
lot of different clients you can build

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,269
them faster using features because

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,859
you're you're writing that code once and

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,380
then you're just reusing it over and

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,269
over again on different Drupal sites the

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,950
second way the use features is for

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,900
advanced deployment and that's all that

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,420
dev the staging the production stuff

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,519
everything's got to be in code I'm not

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,900
going to talk about that but if you have

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,519
questions about that and want to learn

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,319
more about configuration and code you

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:13,280
can ask me after Eric web actually did a

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,810
session about that earlier today okay so

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,789
live demo we're going to go ahead and

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,859
create a feature right now we'll create

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,389
some content types in the cck fields and

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,820
all that jazz and pull it together and

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,909
install it on another Drupal site so

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,930
here is the features project page you

00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,449
can go there has all

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,620
fantastic information everything i'm

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,430
going to show you is going to be under

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,780
drupal 6 from what i understand more or

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,330
less it works pretty much the same with

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,039
drupal 7 DUI is basically the same your

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,639
collection for collecting functionality

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,110
you still need two features module yeah

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,690
when you add new features to other sites

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,020
I don't know too many limitations I

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,470
think there might be some upgrade path

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:57,050
issues highlighted right here as far as

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,380
from betas I don't know about Drupal 6

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:03,680
to 7 anyway second the edge of my screen

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:08,240
over here yes all right so here is my

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,770
duple camp South Carolina features we're

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
going to do an image gallery feature cuz

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,259
that's easy I gotta galleries page over

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,960
here a simple view with all my gallery

00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,180
content types you click on one I got

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,900
recent comments on the side here are

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,970
individual image nodes with the view

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,449
that's being attached to this content

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:32,000
type and light box and this is a quick

00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,780
and easy image gallery so let's see how

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,169
it's made we have to content types image

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,470
gallery and image if we look at the

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:47,539
image gallery it's pretty simple it has

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:50,000
a title if we look at the image node we

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,770
got an image field and a node reference

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,789
so when you create a new image put it in

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:59,599
this gallery very rudimentary we got

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,849
some image cache presets I got a

00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:06,370
thumbnail for when it's displayed below

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:09,110
the node of nice preview when it's above

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,729
i'm using the context module the place

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,710
the recent comments and the right-hand

00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:16,720
side that's not the context module

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,130
that's the context module to place the

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,080
modules in the right hand side who does

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:26,500
not know what the context module is or

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,659
does the context module my friend is a

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,960
condition in reaction module and so i

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:35,300
can set conditions like if I'm viewing

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,270
an image gallery the reaction is going

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,370
to be put the recent comments in the

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,260
sidebar and so it's complete

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,960
different way of placing blocks on your

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,720
website versus the built-in Drupal way I

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,550
I haven't used built in Drupal way since

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:55,160
context came out so i got the context

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,370
and let's see what else do we got we got

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,310
views let's go look at the view I got a

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,229
gallery view here if I edit it I got two

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,470
displays one is the image galleries

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:08,240
which grabs my image galleries and toss

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,540
them and less and then I got the node

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,880
content which gets me my images and i'm

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,820
using the content argument gallery which

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,060
is getting from the URL fancy pancy

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,470
doesn't matter all of this is coming

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,410
together to make one thing and it's an

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,389
image gallery when I create my next site

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,220
I don't want to have to rebuild all of

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,750
that from scratch create content so

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,320
we're going to gather it all up into a

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,750
feature right now so go download the

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,060
module turn the module on you get site

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,010
build features and you can now manage

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,990
and create your features it comes with

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,669
the tests feature I've honestly never

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,200
even turned it on I think it just

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:48,710
creates a content type or something

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,360
shows you how it works I don't know so

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,539
we're going to name our feature image

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,330
gallery it's going to give it a machine

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,289
name of image on the school gallery if

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,190
you want to change that to something

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:05,720
else you can description is going to be

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:08,510
super awesome image gallery you can give

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,849
a version number also it's six point X

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:16,099
point dash 2 point 0 google and then the

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,320
update URL we can ignore for now i'll

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,630
tell you more about that in a moment so

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,789
that's the basic information about my

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,430
feature which is the same basic

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,949
information every module has a name a

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,010
description and the machine-readable

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,440
name of the feature the module so let's

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,479
take a look at the components I like to

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,459
start with content types so I want to

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,529
add the image gallery content type whoa

00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:41,479
so what happened here is I selected I

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,750
want to add image gallery than my

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,459
feature and it automatically came over

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,010
here and said this is everything that

00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:52,730
will automatically detecting that I want

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,670
to export with your feature all of these

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,620
site very

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,470
ables via stronger I'll talk about that

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,020
in a bit the content type image gallery

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,780
and the dependencies so now if I turn on

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,960
image now it's going to grab those cck

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,480
fields it's saying hey this content type

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,370
has cck field regrets more settings and

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,050
now it has more dependencies in which

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,670
field load reference now I want to come

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,760
into context and I'm going to grab

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:25,920
galleries that's going to add more into

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:28,320
my downloads image cache presets I want

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,950
both of these let's turn those on let's

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,830
grab which I think they want all right

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,560
let's go down to views let's get my view

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,660
and if you guys have any questions I'm

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,000
going to go kind of fast so I can get

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,830
through a lot of stuff just shot them

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,300
out raise your hand do I wish you at me

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,250
I don't care so I'm grabbing the view

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,210
and so we can also take a look here what

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,970
else we can download cck is obviously

00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,120
the cck fields context dependencies I

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,130
can declare just like a normal module

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,930
can say hate this model module depends

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,910
on that one you can do the same thing

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:12,300
here this is useful for things like

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:14,670
lightbox adding that view that display

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,770
handler for that field doesn't get

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,950
detected by the feature module so I need

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:23,880
to make sure lightbox gets turned on /

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,700
depended on when i install this module

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,120
and i'm going to go ahead and just go

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,060
click crazy because I want the you is to

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,650
be turned on when I show you guys this

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,810
in the other side that's good enough for

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:41,570
me and so we got our image cache presets

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,310
menus you can export entire menu

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,580
definitions the the menu links that go

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:55,050
on those menus content types we talked

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:57,930
about what's up we're going to download

00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,060
we have permissions all your permissions

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,370
can be exported so when you click one of

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,230
these it's going to store whether this

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,200
permission is on or for each of your

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,339
roles you can download your roles you

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,629
can download

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:17,230
export strong arm is an additional

00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:19,749
module i installed which is groups

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,970
drupal.org / strong arm and what that

00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:23,709
lets you do is export site variables

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,689
anything that's in your variable table

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,819
this long long table can be exported so

00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:33,579
the site may and the site slogan you

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:37,119
know anything there's there's a crap ton

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:40,420
of variables on a real drupal site and

00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:42,069
so i have downloaded i'm sorry i've

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,779
selected everything i want to export

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,480
with this feature I've named it I'm

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,160
going to hit the download button and

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,999
boom I have a new feature let's put this

00:11:48,160 --> 00:12:03,069
on the desktop and we will crank this

00:11:51,999 --> 00:12:05,739
thing open so here is my module and like

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,739
I said it's just like any other drupal

00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:12,369
module more or less we can go ahead and

00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:15,790
take a peek at the info file and see

00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:18,009
what's going on here Drupal 6 here are

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,959
all those dependencies I asked for and

00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:22,299
then the rest of this stuff is the

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,519
features module it's what tells the

00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:26,519
features module hey I'm a feature and

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,049
this is everything that's inside of me

00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,069
and so there's all that stuff and then

00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:35,709
down at the bottom we see the normal

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:37,439
joopa module stuff the name the package

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:40,929
if you wanted to put it under your

00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:42,819
custom code you can put it on the

00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:46,540
features whatever you want to do doesn't

00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:49,990
matter the project name the status URL

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,970
what the status you are well does is you

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,459
download a module and then a security

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,379
update comes out on the update status

00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:59,679
page it says hey there's a new release

00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:03,040
over on drupal.org well what this lets

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,689
you do is say if you update this feature

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,269
later and you've put it on your feature

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:09,549
server which I'll show you later it will

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,410
show that say in your update status hey

00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:14,559
there's a update available for this

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:21,310
feature if you want to download it so if

00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:22,810
we take a look at the the module

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,270
that's all it is that's all the feature

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,010
is its including this include file and

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,080
that include file includes a whole bunch

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,190
of other files and that's what actually

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,840
creates all this stuff there's the cck

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:41,290
fields and the feature image cache

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:43,420
presets that's the dot module the strong

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,000
arm the views you know that's the

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,529
exported view and so that's where all

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,140
this is coming from now the great thing

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,029
about feature modules as is these are

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,040
just modules so if you're drooping

00:13:52,029 --> 00:14:01,870
developer if you want to add something

00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:04,600
here function image gallery form altar

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,490
you can add a form or 30 module anything

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,690
you can do on a regular module you can

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,089
do in here so what I do is all add

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,100
custom CSS and i'll include them with my

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,930
features so when i install them on sites

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,779
they don't look ass ugly you know it

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,710
comes with some generic CSS like most

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,600
modules do that have a UI and so you can

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,670
do that from right here anything else

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,400
your module needs to do I got a module

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,970
that has a menu alter that just defines

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,060
a path it's like a section fun in it it

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:40,930
just creates a path simply for the

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:47,110
context put crap on you know stuff like

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:51,190
that any questions so far great let's go

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:55,380
install this module somewhere so I got

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:58,210
this nice awesome local site over here

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:02,050
and we're going to come to modules and

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:07,630
I'm going to take this guy it's close

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:11,230
you that's now going to drop him right

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:15,040
into my sites all files sites all

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:19,390
modules now if i refresh this I can

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,680
scroll down and see there's my image

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,680
gallery and it's missing some stuff

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,680
awesome

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,300
lightbox stronger use attached all right

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,690
this is not part of the presentation

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:04,850
there we go here we go excellent f5

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,460
let's try this again there we go so now

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,790
I can come in here to my image gallery

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,830
and just so you don't think I'm being

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,600
sneaky will come over here this content

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,110
types page and all we gots page and

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,700
story if I come over here and turn on

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:24,860
this feature it's going to create all of

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:26,950
that stuff for me enable all the other

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,950
stuff

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,959
and there we go we come over here to my

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:54,540
content types they're my two content

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,690
types we can come over the site building

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,630
we can see our image cache presets we

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,360
can see our views everything we created

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,150
in that feature is now created when you

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,520
turn that module on so this is a really

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,429
stupid simple demonstration you know

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,290
it's a little image gallery but you can

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,600
use your imagination you can think

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,520
anything that you can configure more or

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,020
less you can just go ahead and export

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,059
that into a drupal module so the next

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,199
time you need to use it you just turn it

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:27,510
on like that so that is the very basics

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,360
of how our features created how a

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:34,200
feature is exported what do we got next

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:38,610
so organizing and sharing features are

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,090
very easy to create very easy to you

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,860
know get to other people but then

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,390
they're kind of weird in the whole duple

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,000
community they're not they're not real

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,710
the real modules but a lot of people

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,300
don't think the real modules they don't

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,380
belong on drupal.org because their

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,809
features so what development seed came

00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,700
up with and the other guys who created

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,410
the features in the first place was

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,660
something called a feature server and

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,540
it's a really dumbed down version of the

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,890
projects module on drupal.org our

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,960
feature server creates a project content

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,059
type for you and a release content type

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,830
for you you create your projects you add

00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,250
releases to it you point people to your

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,470
website and now people can download your

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,470
features this is code development Sea

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:29,700
Org /f server this is their primary

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,470
feature server and you can see they got

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,790
lots and lots of different stuff in here

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,130
and the cool thing about feature service

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,650
is it's not just for features you can

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,690
upload modules themes installation

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,980
profiles so it's like having your own

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:47,790
mini drupal.org module theme repository

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,190
on your website maybe stuff you know you

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,900
have a very small glue module you know I

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,690
got a module with like five lines of

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,250
code that hides the add to cart button

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:59,130
for ubercart I'm not putting that on

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,810
Jupiter but maybe somebody else

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,770
once that so I keep it in my feature

00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:06,810
survey you know it's kind of simple the

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,360
idea development seed has four feature

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,550
service is that you got a future server

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,500
I got a feature server you know bob has

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,210
a feature server and we're all good at

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,610
different things you know I'm fantastic

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,550
with my events and image gallery content

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,110
type you know bob is great with a real

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,970
estate and so he's got some pretty cool

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,480
real estate stuff and so we kind of

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:31,050
create this whole network of feature

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,540
servers where we can pull from different

00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:38,100
resources with them so I have a feature

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:39,930
server right here it's really simple if

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,510
i come to the projects this is basically

00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,700
the same thing as that i got two

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:47,370
projects and one is my image gallery and

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,410
there are my releases so i just created

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,900
a new release of my image gallery so i'm

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:55,170
going to add a new release i'm going to

00:19:51,900 --> 00:20:00,720
choose the file there it is open it it's

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:03,900
a major version number to project his

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:08,820
image gallery and this is the

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:10,320
recommended version save it boom now

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,780
it's done if I go back to my image

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,270
gallery it's listed as the recommended

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,090
version on it and now I can tell people

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,570
hey you want a badass image gallery come

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,000
to mr. Carlton calm /f server and you

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,740
can download mine and this integrates

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
with Josh make where all you got to do

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,910
is drop this one line into your make

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,520
file and it pulls it straight down from

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,230
other people's server will show more

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,920
about that later any questions on

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:46,050
feature servers you guys are awesome

00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:48,480
you're geniuses address download I I

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:51,750
don't know you could probably do a rush

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,060
dl and then mark the source or we can

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:59,280
try and see what happens and so that's a

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,630
feature server and this is where this

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:06,210
code right here feature server dot local

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,740
/f server that is what you put when

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,100
you're creating your features as your

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,750
update URL that way if i update if i add

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,000
2.1 to this and

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,160
you downloaded my 2.0 version it's going

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,440
to tell you hey carnitine just added a

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,880
2.1 version here the notes you want to

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,370
download it like it does in the other

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:29,760
module awesome so that's a feature

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:33,630
server so what does drush everybody in

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,870
here knows what Russia's everybody saw

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:42,060
it and used it great fantastic let's go

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:47,390
ahead quickly oh man did you make a

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:51,380
sandwich that's my favorite Rush demo

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:55,560
Josh can do everything make me a

00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:01,430
sandwich seed rush can be kind of mean

00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,430
sometimes so you got to really get at it

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:12,080
there we go Thank you Thank You Josh I

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:12,080
appreciate that so josh Josh dl help

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:28,680
Josh help to you what do we got here so

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,870
destinations source the base URL which

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:36,050
provides project release information in

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,050
XML defaults to so I think we can do

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:49,200
Josh download image galleries source

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:51,980
equals HTTP feature server local f

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,980
server

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,780
I think the answer is yes it didn't

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:07,980
quite like the way I did that though but

00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,720
i'm sure this way oh it says oh yeah

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,929
there we go so it was just being angry

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:17,309
with me so that's how you do that so

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:19,260
Josh make everybody knows what Josh make

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:22,260
is does anybody not know what Josh

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:26,940
makers raise your hand why you guys are

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:33,120
awesome so I will skip through this part

00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,040
really fast I had my little just to

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,510
recap real quick drush make can pretty

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,550
much do everything and make you coffee

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:43,200
it will download modules download games

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:45,179
download installation profiles it will

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,559
check out the code from wherever you

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,470
want it to check out it will download

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,090
any file you want it to download it will

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,410
fetch and apply patches to pretty much

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,440
anything you want the fetch and apply

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:59,370
patches to its it's rather versatile

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,350
it's rather amazing I for deploying

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,050
sites getting sites up and running very

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:07,429
fast it's really really really cool

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:12,570
because it gets it done fast and easy

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:18,120
I'll show you how it works with where's

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:22,170
my mouse I had a mouse there it is I'll

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,900
show you how it integrates with featured

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,250
which is basically you add this line to

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,750
your just make file and now it's

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,820
downloading from feature servers so

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,160
let's go ahead and do that real quick so

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,679
we can know LuAnn are at it and then

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,970
we'll move on to the fun part which is

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,970
installation profiles

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:46,520
alright so let's just take this up here

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:57,150
alright so I have an awesome make file

00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,820
right here downloading Drupal just

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,550
grabbing a bunch of modules right here

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,350
is features i'm downloading i'm just

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:07,530
telling it go get image gallery and grab

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,420
it from feature server local this is

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,700
where you're going to take advantage of

00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,470
go get my module for my site go get his

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,780
module from his side his feature from

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,960
his site really cool stuff and then i'm

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:22,080
grabbing jquery UI when i'm not

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,570
downloading the jquery UI module because

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,040
i deleted that earlier so let's go ahead

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:43,940
and just get rid of that so it doesn't

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:43,940
waste my time alright so now Josh make

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,930
awesome make file and i like to call

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:57,060
prepare install which just copies the

00:25:51,930 --> 00:26:00,240
default settings dot PHP / and sets up

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:03,810
the permissions on it and stuff so it

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,800
reads to make file has anyone not seen

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:09,780
this happen before why you guys even in

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,720
my session it's for the profiles isn't

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:18,560
it any questions while this is hmm why

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,560
didn't you raise your hand

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:30,100
it's okay he did it and I didn't pick on

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:34,980
him until now sorry thank you I came up

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,820
with it I let some kid put in his name

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,990
alright that's not really what happened

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:44,350
I'm sorry Dimitri so it's downloading

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:46,990
stuff downloading you can see it already

00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,490
downloaded my image gallery from local

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,260
feature server and long story short I'm

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,970
going to install this site and turn on

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,360
my image gallery module and proof all

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,910
that stuff is made again all we're

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,880
really doing here shaving time off of

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,620
how long it takes us to get from point A

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,610
not having a site at all but having they

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,230
want a functional spec to a point where

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:15,520
let's actually do some real work some

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:20,740
custom development some you know know

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,570
some you know real work the goal is you

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,190
want to install a site and have all the

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,260
basic features they're done finished

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,820
ready to go all you got to do is apply

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:33,280
your paint and spackle and you're done

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:35,290
so there is just make so what can't

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,840
features do add on the box features

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:40,540
can't do a lot of stuff it can't export

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,070
variables and won't export blocks it

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,320
doesn't do taxonomy terms basically

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,690
anything that's not exportable which

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,780
means it doesn't have unique identifier

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,669
associated with that piece of content

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,710
features isn't going to grab it there's

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,390
lots of modules out there since features

00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,340
has come out that helps with this strong

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,360
arm is one that I showed you which is

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:04,330
variables boxes is a cool module it's

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,380
basically blocks with machine names and

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:11,110
so you can your custom your custom boxes

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,330
your custom blocks can then be exported

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,330
if you create a view that's a block

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,520
display that will be exported you know

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,090
anything that's exportable that creates

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:26,290
a block that's ok but like custom blocks

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:28,240
stuff like that that doesn't work when

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,300
you install a context module that comes

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,360
with its own built-in X portables a lot

00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,090
of modules are starting

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,000
add importing and exporting to the code

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,710
features there's like two or three ways

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,220
to do it one of them is to use the

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,830
features API another way is see tools

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,350
created a API for importing and

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,270
exporting that ties in the features so

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,309
if you come across a module that you

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,770
know does an export or anything like

00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:59,960
that the first place you could probably

00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:04,040
look is integrating it with C tools I'm

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:07,610
trying to think of what else I don't

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,140
know if something doesn't export it

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,200
doesn't mean it's the end of the day

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,870
maybe for your designer sorry if you're

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,990
a developer remember these are these are

00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:20,390
modules so maybe your event calendar

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,870
comes with taxonomy vocabularies and you

00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:27,260
have a preset of terms use the install

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,510
hook to create those terms after the

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,890
modules installed stuff like that so you

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:34,130
know you can use your install hooks

00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:36,860
uninstalls your update the module hooks

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:43,220
to supplement what the base features are

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:46,270
doing any questions about that all right

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,400
now let's have fun the profile module is

00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:52,669
really really cool it's easy peasy

00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:56,120
install profiles which means it's easy

00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:58,280
peasy do-it-yourself distributions you

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,500
know your niche maybe church websites

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:05,750
and what you can do is create the church

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,700
features the podcast the community

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,429
groups all of that then you create the

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,620
make file which the make file will go

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:15,020
get all of that for you but then it just

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,390
leaves it there for you to install the

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,640
next step is the installation profile

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:24,380
which turns stuff on configure stuff

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,299
does extra work that you can't do out of

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,910
the box and so once you have an install

00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,559
profile you can say install my drupal

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,049
site after I just got it with the make

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,730
file using this install profile and

00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,740
that'll turn your modules on that'll set

00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,410
the theme that'll set some base content

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,720
that'll make you a sandwich I don't know

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,940
so let's go ahead and take a look at

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,250
that it's my new I've been doing this

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,770
session for quite a while now and

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,900
this is my new favorite part of the

00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:53,750
session so profile basically what it is

00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,460
it's a out of the box that doesn't do

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:59,540
anything by itself it's just a group of

00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:01,550
API functions that help you create

00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:06,770
installation profiles in a very very

00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:09,440
easy way all you got to do is come to

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,630
this page and go down to the read the

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,940
documentation and this will show you how

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,910
easy it is to create an installation

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,350
profile so what I have here is you're

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,950
just going to create a folder and create

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:28,400
three files you mean info file a make

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:32,750
file and a profile profile file anyway

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,660
so if you come in here this is going to

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:42,110
tell you everything you need in here so

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:44,930
we'll start with our our profile file

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,610
all that it takes if you're free to PHP

00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,070
don't worry about it profile expects

00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,930
that the dot profile foul initializes

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:54,110
the profile IPA with the following lines

00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:56,480
of code boom that right there that's all

00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,910
you need all the PHP coding you got to

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,000
do you cut and paste these two lines and

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:04,970
then right here this is going to be like

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,760
your profile whatever you name that

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:11,660
whatever your profile name is in my case

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,900
it's awesome you know this could be new

00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,480
site church type real estate site

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,510
whatever your install profile does once

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,690
you say that that's it you're done the

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:25,550
next thing is going to be the makefile

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:29,860
your installation profile can go and

00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,860
grab modules and download them for you

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:38,030
during the rush make fades so this is a

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:43,640
again basically that same make file with

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:48,130
a few different changes here my modules

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm getting that image gallery feature

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:56,060
one thing i'm downloading under

00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:58,280
libraries which i guess if I was going

00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,790
to organize this correctly that would

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,790
come down here

00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:08,890
I'm going to go get the latest version

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:10,930
of profiler which is 2 point 0 beta 2

00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,620
and that goes into your sites all

00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:18,070
libraries directory and so I'm going to

00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,650
go get that and just like that I'm

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:24,340
downloading a special theme for my

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:27,910
profile and then jquery UI there's my

00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,580
make file and then the info file is

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:34,450
where all the magic happens so like any

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,670
module theme installation profile you

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,460
need a name a description this is my

00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:42,970
awesome profile it is the most awesome

00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:47,020
profile ever start here at drupa South

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:49,120
Carolina first so dependencies i'm going

00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,490
to say under dependencies when you

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,160
install what modules do you want to turn

00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,680
on only turn on image gallery now in

00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,420
turn on the admin module image gallery

00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,830
is going to say hey I depend on all

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,320
these are the modules so it's going to

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,620
go ahead and turn all of that stuff on

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:08,050
and admin is pretty i'm going to say

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:11,590
switch over to this theme i'm going to

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,530
say when you install go ahead and create

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,389
me the very first node is going to be

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,310
type page the title is going to be

00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:22,840
welcome to my site the body is going to

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:24,310
be you know this and the UID is one and

00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,389
then finally the last thing we're going

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:30,639
to say set the front page to node / one

00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:33,370
and all of this stuff is nicely

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,129
documented here and this readme off the

00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,690
profile page it shows us some of your

00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:40,899
the files you're going to have here

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,760
again this is a profile so you could

00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,500
have a doc install for custom stuff

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,620
going on that happens after the

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:51,129
installation process and here's the dot

00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:53,860
info file name description core base if

00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:56,860
this is like a sub profile of another

00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:00,910
profile you can define that here you can

00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:03,430
set your dependencies you can use this

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,980
syntax right here to disable modules

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,540
that Drupal core turns on by default you

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,860
know what do I need the color module for

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,350
turn that off I don't need the book

00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,890
module turn that off setting themes

00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:16,190
setting variables

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:19,430
you can create users with this you could

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,099
create nodes with this you can create

00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,900
taxonomy terms this way there's a lot a

00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:26,029
lot a lot of different things you can do

00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,670
here I think there may be even more than

00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:31,819
what's tagged here because they just did

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,490
a new release but I'm not fantastically

00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:39,650
sure but let's go ahead and take a look

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:42,890
so i have this insulation profile again

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:46,700
it's these three files profile make dot

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:50,349
info I'm going to tear this up awesome

00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,349
that Tara and I'm going to go ahead oh

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,750
well while that's happening so i have

00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,190
this profile i'm going to put it into a

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,049
tar and then I'm going back to my

00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,809
feature server I'm going to upload that

00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:06,230
as an installation profile on my future

00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:08,869
server so later using the power just

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:11,450
make I can download that file again oh I

00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,029
can tell other people hey check out my

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:19,450
awesome installation profile it's on my

00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:19,450
website which I'll show you in a second

00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:46,460
hmm last night what did I dream about I

00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:48,410
don't know I can't remember I don't

00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,910
remember my dreams sorry any questions

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,079
about any of this so far we're going to

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:53,079
have plenty of time left over I think

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,660
yes the features module is required

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,230
because the features module has the API

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:12,540
that parses all those includes and

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,940
includes them and imports them and all

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,050
that jazz so here's my future server

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,170
we're going to come back here the

00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:22,230
projects here's my awesome profile I've

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:24,390
already uploaded this but uh you know if

00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,880
I would edit this it's basically the

00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,520
same thing as any other module I got the

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,460
name the machine name I'm saying this is

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,010
an installation profile the packaging

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,050
method this is really cool I can tell

00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:40,500
joopa linstead of manually uploading

00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:43,050
files it's going to determine the

00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,100
releases based off of my get tags based

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:52,050
off of my svn repository tags so i can

00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:54,540
select this put in my repository your

00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,180
URL right there and then every time I

00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,370
tagged a new release this will create

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,340
that new release for me that's a really

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:05,040
really cool thing the description blah

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:10,860
blah blah blah blah so if I come back to

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:14,040
here here is my distribution basically

00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:16,530
is right there this profiler module

00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,110
includes a make file of all the stuff

00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,940
that's included it includes the info and

00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,940
side profile which turns all the crap on

00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,980
that right there I would call a

00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:31,380
distribution and so if I wanted to

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:35,010
install this I'd create a make file i'm

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,610
saying i need duple 6 and go get my

00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:43,980
profile installation profile so if we

00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:47,580
come over here and say there's nothing

00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:52,410
there so let's go ahead and take you

00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:54,710
down here and I'll become God for a

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,710
moment

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,720
so there's my also make file I just

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:16,020
showed you to remove that all right Josh

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:18,340
make awesome prepare install yes so now

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,680
it gets Drupal it got the information

00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,270
from my profile it's going to download

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,030
both of those and then it's going to

00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:27,190
open up my profile and say hey I just

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,190
found a make file called awesome that

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:36,090
make and now it's reading that make file

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:38,560
make files what's the word recursively

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,849
the recursive so you can put a make file

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,359
to make file and make phone and make

00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:46,480
violets you'd never do that but in this

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,640
case this is why it's really cool you

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,650
can have a make file that is your base

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,230
make Val I'm always going to have views

00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,940
I'm always going to have cck all this

00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,890
stuff and then you can have a second

00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:02,619
make file that and start dividing them

00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:05,080
up stuff like this is my new site make

00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:07,210
file this is my event site my real

00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,310
estate site make file then you add

00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,290
installation profiles for that and then

00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:14,200
you have a profile make file including a

00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:17,800
site specific profile make file that

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:22,680
includes the base make file whoo all

00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,680
right so it's downloading all this stuff

00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,119
no this is not installing Drupal for

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,540
scratch you still have to walk through

00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:33,730
the installation process however if we

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,859
come here i'm going to say let's install

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:39,010
with my awesome profile i'll hit save

00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:44,339
and continue I that didn't work for some

00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:44,339
reason chama chama chama

00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:11,080
there we go distro let's save and

00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:14,620
continue now it's reading my profile

00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:29,140
it's turning on all those modules distro

00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:31,900
Matthew Matthew and save continue now

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,400
I'm done installing and normally after

00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,010
you're done installing and you click on

00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,380
take me to a new site you come to the

00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,750
garland welcome to your site nothing's

00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,830
installed but this time because of our

00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:48,580
installation profile that's not the case

00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:51,070
the theme was set for some reason that

00:41:48,580 --> 00:42:00,930
Edmund wasn't turned on and I don't know

00:41:51,070 --> 00:42:04,300
why man it was slow local computer today

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:06,100
but anyway there it is a profile it

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,520
turns on the theme for me that's my home

00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,380
page that I created and then if I were

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,080
to come to admin modules and stuff all

00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:16,060
those that feature module i created is

00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,290
there turned on installed ready to go

00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:25,900
maybe hopefully and there's an

00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:27,280
installation profile in a box we got 18

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,050
minutes to talk about whatever you guys

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,460
want to talk about we get we got in all

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:38,110
of this one thing before I go on drush

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,850
if you don't know if you don't if you

00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,830
aren't using dress yet I did a Drupal

00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:45,520
dojo not too long ago and how to install

00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:47,500
josh on your server and I cover shared

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,640
servers VPS you pretty much installed

00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,230
rush anyway you want on a linux server

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,300
as long as you have shell access so

00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,980
check out the drupal dojo if you have

00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,930
that issues i've shared service stuff

00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:05,099
like that

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:24,210
and that's it so any questions anything

00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:28,290
at all say that again press flow is a

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:30,210
fork it's not an install profile so yeah

00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:35,339
you can you can use all of this on press

00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:48,750
flow from what I understand shouldn't

00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:51,150
get confused at all profiler is great

00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:53,520
for if you need to create an install

00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,890
profile but you don't want to hunt and

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,420
find for the docs that don't exist on

00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:06,569
how to create an install profile and

00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:13,049
rupal 6 yeah profile is just for

00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:14,700
installing client needs a change that

00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:16,740
that you're going in the deployment and

00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,260
stuff like that let me give you a quick

00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,910
example of how we can use features for

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:27,150
deployment if I come over here to my

00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:37,670
little local site which is over here say

00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:45,089
I edit this view and I go let's sort by

00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:48,270
title alphabetically so this view is in

00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:51,150
code it's created by the feature and i

00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:53,280
am now changing this view what this is

00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,339
going to do is over on my features it's

00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:01,079
going to list my feature is overridden

00:44:55,339 --> 00:45:06,569
versus being in default now i have two

00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:08,490
choices right now i can either revert

00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:11,050
what I did and go back to what's a code

00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:14,020
or i can take the changes i may

00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:17,740
invite them to code and the way you can

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:24,670
do that is with drush my favorite Josh

00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:32,170
command so let's go back to my new site

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:34,210
local site W public so just feature list

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,400
is going to list all the features i have

00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,250
and it shows me that image gallery is

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,200
over linen so now i am going to tell

00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,650
josh to take all those overhead and

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,240
changes and light them to the feature

00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,670
over write the code with the new changes

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,970
and I do that by saying josh feature

00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:56,850
update the image i mean the the module

00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:59,410
or in this case Josh fu image gallery

00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,910
it's going to say hey this module

00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,120
already exists are you sure you want to

00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:06,820
over like this i'm going to say yes and

00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,490
now all those changes i made are written

00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:12,430
into the code so if i come back here and

00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:16,360
refresh this it's not going to be

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:22,630
overridden anymore everything is back to

00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:25,450
a default state now the way this works

00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,970
with deployment and making changes with

00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,270
client is your code is in version

00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:33,870
controller to get and so I have that

00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:37,540
repository checked out on my server as

00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:40,210
development and ye i have it checked out

00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:43,210
on the production server as a production

00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:45,130
tag and the client says I want you to

00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,320
changes view saw them in title so what

00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:49,840
you do is on your dev server you say

00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:54,730
Josh you know you make the change Josh

00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:58,210
fu that feature get is going to say hate

00:46:54,730 --> 00:47:01,330
you change files you say okay get ad get

00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:03,250
commit get push origin master or get

00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,810
tagged whatever a new live release and

00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,940
then on your production server you can

00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,350
pull those changes in and when you pull

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,180
those changes in on your production

00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:12,700
server it's going to be the new default

00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:16,420
state clear your caches it's now done

00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:18,720
it's live so that's a nice a very

00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:22,060
simplified version of how you can push

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,700
changes to your production environment

00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:30,609
if you're using this multi-tier

00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:33,180
system as far as features I always want

00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:35,500
my features to be in a default state I

00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:37,750
there's no reason for the features be

00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,490
overridden if it's over waiting you

00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:43,660
either need to write those changes into

00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:47,200
the code or you need to revert it it's

00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:50,710
just data that's easy to get lost or

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:54,130
lose for no reason and so like I said on

00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,250
Josh you can do a feature FL the show on

00:47:54,130 --> 00:48:00,420
and do it Josh fu or if you have lots of

00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:03,460
features you can do a Josh F you all and

00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,430
that will make you feel a little better

00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,960
inside as you're reverting your features

00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:12,180
if you're having an issue reverting

00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:20,170
features you can do dress eff you image

00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:23,349
image gallery image gallery and then tag

00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:27,060
on force and now that will normally if

00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:29,589
you just a few an image gallery will

00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,290
only see what's overridden and like

00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:33,700
those changes if you add the force it no

00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,730
matter what it's just going to rebuild

00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:42,250
that feature based on what's going on in

00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:43,599
code I mean in the database so what

00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,890
about you I know you got a question

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,349
you've been begging all day they asked

00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,349
me a question no questions from them

00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,810
absolutely absolutely because reading

00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:57,240
from the code is going to be a lot

00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:02,380
faster than reading from the database

00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:04,060
and that's less intensive and with all

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,680
this stuff being a code that's exactly

00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,630
what's being read from all these views

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,950
all of that it's an it's not going to be

00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,819
read from the database it's going to be

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,819
in the the code

00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:39,550
well at this point features is a make

00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,349
your own adventure book it really

00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:45,310
depends on how you want to do features

00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:46,930
if you're making features to reuse over

00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,970
and over again then yeah you're going to

00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,430
want to keep that feature of the day if

00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:54,970
you have to if the update the context

00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:58,540
really doesn't do anything on the actual

00:49:54,970 --> 00:50:02,070
context side of it then no you don't

00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:04,119
have to rebuild the feature and nowadays

00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,500
module maintainers are pretty good at

00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,900
saying hey you know this is going to

00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:12,490
break this functionality with this new

00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:15,750
release personally when I'm using

00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:18,550
reusing features it really just depends

00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:21,339
it's very easy for your features to fork

00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:23,050
I got the image gallery on client a site

00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:25,359
and they want a slideshow with little

00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,440
thumbnails beneath them but on client be

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,000
they don't want to slide show with

00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,500
little things beneath them they won a

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,880
big old grid with image box and so you

00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,070
know ninety percent of that feature is

00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,080
the same except for that very last house

00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,460
it actually being displayed you can do

00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,130
two things you could just fork the

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,170
features and stopped maintaining two

00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,750
different features or you can have a

00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,330
base feature which is your information

00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,130
architecture of the content types and

00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,320
all that stuff and then have multiple

00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:56,250
display features of this adds a

00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,290
slideshow block view to it this adds a

00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:01,810
gallery view to it this does the

00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:05,290
hokey-pokey so really it depends on how

00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:07,810
you want to use features I'm using

00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:10,119
features with some clients where the

00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,890
there's we're not using these features

00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,800
we're just packing a bunch of crap into

00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:16,930
them simply to get that stuff in code so

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,690
it's easier than migrate from dev the

00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:24,060
staging the production there's no reason

00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:26,560
that we use them do you have a question

00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,760
sorry I thought I saw you do a little I

00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,760
like questions

00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:35,319
any more questions how many people are

00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:41,189
going to start using features in

00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:43,119
profiler now nice nice all right well

00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:44,319
let me know if you have any questions

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,150
and if you want to know more about the

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,910
whole dev staging pod and features thing

00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:50,910
you come ask me about that thank you

00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:08,469
what about this I can help it like it we

00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:12,150
have the same problem what would happen

00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:12,150
if you do you think the iphone

00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,510
let's let the word out

00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,510
you

00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:34,430
well LS nos that works the way that you

00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:39,590
do across all your devices HP Slate and

00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:42,500
webos HP as a service leader in cloud

00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,240
computing all we do is hosted computing

00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,280
to us the cloud is just the next

00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,720
generation of hosting and if someone

00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,369
who's been in the hosting industry for

00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,440
12 years we feel we're in a unique

00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:53,119
position to really help bring these two

00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,950
worlds together these different sets of

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,290
technologies and to help companies

00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:00,170
embrace this new world in this great new

00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:02,060
tool that allows faster innovation not

00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:04,040
only is it about us being responsive and

00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,430
accountable but it's about us doing more

00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,430
for you

00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,310
