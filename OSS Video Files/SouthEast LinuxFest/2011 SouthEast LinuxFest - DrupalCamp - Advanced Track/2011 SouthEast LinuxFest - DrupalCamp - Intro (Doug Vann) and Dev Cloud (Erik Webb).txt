speaking at the regular Linux tracks

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,080
about Drupal and they said hey come out

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,600
to selfies and looks fast and do it do a

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,369
drupal camp for us and we exchanged

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
e-mails back and forth and finally I

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,770
finally understood what they meant was

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,080

using tools like features and Josh and

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,810

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,540
out definitely thanks so much the video

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,720
says emma has been recorded so you can

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,020
play it back at half speed you know look

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,010
it'll be easier understand he goes fast

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,789
you're speaking of it but I have no idea

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,639
who you are come on up Nikolai oh good

00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:35,050
you're um yeah I'm actually checking

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,240
that one out so this morning I'm going

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,479
to do a session introduction at City CRM

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,479
which is by far the coolest erm for

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,979
nonprofits it's open source I used to

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,520
work at flashposse so I know all the

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:50,320
private area like competition so just

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,150
cool like immigration rules integration

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,889
with views check that out of doing

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,750
implementations for nonprofits it is

00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,950
geared more towards the folk to

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,610
implement this stuff or organic

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,080
optimized Lydia and then the afternoon

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,120
it hurts rush if you've never used it

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,150
it's this really sweet command line tool

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,669
to do a lot of your cool stuff without

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,960
having to click wait clicking like and

00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,930
downloading late fourth and wait some

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,190
more if you already know drush you might

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,050
want to check out another session it's

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,660
definitely like intro to some of the

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,650
commands but once you learn that then

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,930
you kind of you can really go and do

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,630
some cool stuff like acres build very

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,099
much on underestimate so i'll show you

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,110
how to create make file so that you can

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:39,010
run one file and create a full drupal

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,400
site sweep heelys Biggers from today

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,550
today wandering in since we started you

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,990
know we've covered all the speakers who

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,490
got up early okay good um and if Ivan

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,070
pompous my voice I was screaming at the

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,979
dual-core concert last night so that's

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,139
how that goes everything every camp i go

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:04,479
to ice cream about something

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:07,569
I am actually going to make it to the

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,490
first four sessions I'm checking out

00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,080
Nikolai at managing and building sites

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,610
with dressing dressmaker but checking

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,039
that out and they're going to head out

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,110
to redmond washington to microsoft's

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,599
offices from linux fest to Microsoft's

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,789
Office and I love that they're inviting

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:27,099
a bunch of open-source engineers users

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:28,599
developers CMS people etc George from

00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:32,289
palantir will be there British from

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:34,539
chapter 3 myself Robert Jacoby from one

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,590
of the joomla shops in Chicago and I

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,840
don't know who else I'll find out when I

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,199
get there but they're showing off their

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,669
webmatrix tool so you will not see me

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:51,099
past a past three past 230 so adds up on

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:54,129
that I'm going to now ask Eric to get

00:06:51,099 --> 00:07:02,050
you all jobs and educate you on cool

00:06:54,129 --> 00:07:03,969
stuff that exists take it away this is

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,839
definitely the shameless plug section of

00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:09,339
the presentation for all the early

00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,649
risers out there have free 3 month

00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:17,740
Charles to devcloud anyone's interested

00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:21,099
so I'm glad you asked I didn't plant

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:24,969
that question I promise so devcloud is

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:28,509
essentially a managed hosting solution

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:30,639
for drupal so basically we host your

00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:35,379
subversion repositories or get soon in

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,520
the next few weeks I believe and all you

00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,199
have to do is worry about doing the

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,240
Drupal development we have a fully tuned

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,009
stack out in the cloud we can scale it

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,300
however it's needed we can we facilitate

00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:48,909
deployment between environments it's all

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,560
it's all one stop shop so that you can

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:56,949
just focus on development and leave the

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:59,490
system ministration to other people so

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:02,740
I'm actually going to steal from the

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,379
brains behind dev cloudberry jasmine and

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,490
Alex they just narrate over his

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:08,490
screencast he has here

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:14,310
so like I was saying devcloud is our

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,050
everyone knows we have our managed cloud

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,660
or aqua hosting is a used to be called

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,510
which is our large-scale multi-tier

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,850
redundant a che all the real big fancy

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:27,810
stuff devcloud is sort of our answers

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:31,380
for both developers as well as just

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,539
smaller sites the name might be a little

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,700
misleading it's not just for development

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,370
you can host full-fledged sights on it

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,169
it comes with varnish and memcache and

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,039
all the tuning you'd expect from a full

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,210
server it's just on a single server so I

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,920
think that's the number one

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,690
misconception we get is it's something

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,180
that you develop on then you have to

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,310
figure out some way to move it off our

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,280
base plan you can host up to three sites

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,770
on it so for you know if you have

00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,940
smaller clients or you just want to have

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,890
a couple different sites you're

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,160
developing on locally it's actually

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,470
perfectly sized for that their bait if

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,380
any guys know much by Amazons are the

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,900
base packages see one medium which is I

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,460
think two gigs of ram and two cores so

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,860
it's definitely a little bit more than

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,290
your average VPS so it's a great

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,060
starting point to actually see how your

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,690
site can really perform on a well-tuned

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,000
stack once you throw in varnish memcache

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,460
and all that you can have all the

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,420
benefits of a fully administered server

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:35,820
without any of the effort at all as

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,560
we'll see here in just a second we also

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,260
have a lot of graphical tools to make

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,660
deployment easier once you actually have

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,520
the deployment process sort of in a

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,740
steady state which is what I'll be

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,450
presenting on today we have all these

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,010
features so that if you just want to

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,410
start off with a Drupal distribution

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:57,240
it's all point-and-click you get running

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,680
there so if you're just if you need a

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,300
starting points it's just something you

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,890
want to test out you can use this purely

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,530
to sandbox if you're interested in that

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,660
but at the same time we also can import

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,640
Drupal sites so one thing we've been

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,890
working hard on the dress is there's

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,110
actually an export command for drush no

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,060
I don't know how many guys have actually

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,280
noticed that in there but it actually

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,920
backs up your entire Drupal site the

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,980
database the settings all that endows

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,430
special archive format that you can just

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,870
upload

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:29,520
into our our direct our repository and

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,899
it's just you run it from the command

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,730
line it gives you one file and you

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,860
upload that one file and you're good to

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,110
go there's no more it does all the

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,670
importing from of the database importing

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,440
of code does all of that for you and

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,089
that's something we've been working on

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,860
the community so it's it's probably

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,589
likely the other hosting providers will

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,600
use that in the future so it's

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,370
definitely not something that we've just

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
kind of developing on our own it's

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:58,200
definitely something out there for

00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:03,779
everyone to benefit from so let's get to

00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:07,080
the deployment here okay so combined

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,700
with our dev desktop tool again this is

00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,430
something we've recently renamed it used

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,770
everyone knows if I damp or the just ah

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,480
quadruple the control panel we've

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,060
actually reengineered it so you can

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,120
actually export from your local machine

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,920
developing straight into devcloud so it

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,350
can even handle all the uploading for

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,140
you again just through point click and

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,520
this has versions for windows and mac

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,330
for the linux guys i'm sure you guys

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:37,740
know how to do it anyway so but it's all

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:40,830
just one it's all just one collective

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,690
sweet we worked hard managed cloud a lot

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,250
of the onboarding there is getting

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,040
people's code committed and getting

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,779
databases and all that stuff that real

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,370
large scale you know hundreds of

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,709
thousands of hits a month millions of

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,810
hits a month we host they can deal with

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:57,540
that kind of over but if you're rapidly

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,300
turning out smaller sites it's just too

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,760
much work for that to happen so if we

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,350
look at our workflow here we have every

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,839
site comes with a staging and a

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,670
production environment so that's just

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,180
out of the box on the one machine you

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:15,029
get and you can actually drag and drop

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,829
just between all your environments so

00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:19,200
what this actually does if you drag and

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:21,510
drop code this isn't just copying files

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,670
like a lot of tools out there do this is

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,410
actually automatically creating a tag in

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,870
your version control system and

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,149
deploying the tag so not only is easy

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,589
but it's actually following absolute

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:37,290
best practices and it's same thing with

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:39,180
files and databases you can just copy

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,820
all those over and files meaning the

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,639
upload files of course and all this is

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,839
just completely automated I'll be

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,630
talking a little bit about how to do

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,399
this with drush but essentially this is

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,550
what we're doing underneath is we're

00:12:50,399 --> 00:13:04,160
using all community tools we're just

00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:04,160
kind of bringing it as far as we can and

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:13,649
so the one last piece um so it's

00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:15,540
definitely the course there's some of

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:18,170
this is obviously marketing pitch but as

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,899
a system inis traitor by trade myself

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,540
there's definitely a big gap between

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,560
setting up your Drupal site once and

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,509
actually maintaining two or three

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,800
different environments and that's

00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:32,360
exactly the problem we're trying to

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,360
solve here oh

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,530
good enough so it's all about so for the

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,440
developers the big things are we have an

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:55,050
optimized environment there's low cost

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,000
entry you can get up and running through

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,120
our tools through just a simple export

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,500
process and also it's fully maintained

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,790
so you never have to worry about

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,780
software updates all the all the

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,780
optimizations we've done for our managed

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,430
cloud that hosts some really huge Drupal

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,010
sites tens of millions of hits a month

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,740
all those same optimizations go into

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,410
every single developers workflow so

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,570
everything from optimizing the database

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,450
on the fly as you're importing which is

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,820
all stuff we've pioneered into just

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,320
having really sane Drupal specific

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,510
defaults for the whole hosting

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,430
infrastructure we don't host anything

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,530
other than Drupal we don't care to host

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,260
anything other than Drupal we have an

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,640
environment that's completely tuned just

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,190
for Drupal that's all it will be tuned

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,380
for and you definitely get the most bang

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,000
for your buck when you're looking for a

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,410
really specific solution versus

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,520
something very generic so I definitely

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,730
don't want to go through the whole pitch

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:58,170
here but like i said i have three month

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,520
trials here I believe the I don't want

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,250
to be wrong on the price but i believe

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,200
the yearly subscription is somewhere

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,510
starts under about five hundred a year i

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,650
think and for right now we're doing

00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:13,620
yearly instead of just monthly which

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,600
will come shortly so we're definitely

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,520
looking for small dev shops for this

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,370
medium dev shops and just need other

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,810
environments to play with and you know

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,770
we're we're really trying to ramp this

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,510
up as a not just stayed not just another

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,910
product but actually a compliment to our

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,470
managed cloud where we're looking for

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,780
we're really looking to build a

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,160
community of people in devcloud that can

00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,710
create their sites there and once their

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,990
sites outgrow it we can provide one

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,450
one-click solutions to go from the dev

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,200
cloud instance to our larger much more

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:48,180
robust managed cloud instances so we're

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,770
trying to create a big ecosystem big

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,750
community around having both of these

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,160
products and bringing them all together

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,050
so any quick questions I don't want to

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:04,480
take over the whole session here but any

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:04,480
quick questions I can answer okay

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,689
we'll generator

00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:28,819
alright so the question is does sir how

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,529
does Drupal Gardens fit in with devcloud

00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:33,749
the best thing I can say is there

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:35,339
managed at different levels at Drupal

00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:37,319
garden we actually managed at the drupal

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,079
level so we handle all the security

00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:42,779
updates Drupal bug fixes we're doing all

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,220
that at the actual Drupal layer this is

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,929
more for someone that's developing a

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,389
custom site needs a deployment to

00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:51,720
servers this we are managing at the

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:53,939
server level so they're not where

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,069
devcloud Amanda's cloud or sort of

00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,379
complimentary Drupal gardens is kind of

00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:00,179
its own product drupal gardens is

00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,789
definitely more for prototyping brochure

00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:05,970
we're simpler sites this is more of a

00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:10,049
way to host more custom sites that are

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:13,620
actually being actively developed so any

00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:16,169
other questions I can help out with all

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,970
right after this keynote come get me

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,339
we'll be handing out the dev Claude

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,079
subscriptions and they all have a

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,319
special coupon code it'll be three

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,600
months so just enough to whet your

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,659
appetite not a little one month trial

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:38,519
where you sign up and forget about it so

00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:39,929
all right thanks Evan thank you so we

00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,879
have other people come in any more

00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:46,399
speakers for today there's one grunt

00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:48,330
wander in the room no more speakers wow

00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:54,750
that's going to be interesting as the

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:56,519
day progresses when we shall see so

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,840
everybody knows what we're doing where

00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,950
they're going these are the three rooms

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,029
the air walls are going to be close to

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,159
your shortly we're going to break up

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:07,889
what is it is it a over here and then bc

00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:09,360
right okay that's how that goes cool any

00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:11,879
questions about the ruling of the day

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,460
what's going on the only question I have

00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:17,009
is where all the presenters didn't get

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,500
lost in there all right so that's a wrap

00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:22,409
we will be back in our respective rooms

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,059
at ten-fifteen so that's going to give

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,289
us a long break and everybody's and

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,610
finally wake up get breakfast and show

00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:28,610
up thank you

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,610
what about this I can help the like it

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,510
we have the same problem or whatever to

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,510
do you think

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,360
let's let the word out

00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,360
you

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:07,240
webos an OS that works the way that you

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:12,340
do across all your devices HP Slate and

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:15,010
whether less HP as a service leader in
