net neutrality and all that and that is

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,579
a guy that got the election 14 2012

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,520
because he built a system that could not

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,850
be blowing up and the reason is because

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,160
he tried to blow out of every single

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,600
week that he went in the work and he

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,640
would go into his server stack and just

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,260
start pulling up plugs and and blowing

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,590
up the system any way he could and his

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,619
developers the team of 40 people that he

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,400
personally recruited himself figured out

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,040
a way around it and when when go time

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,890
came he was able to push data down to

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,710
his his campaign workers and absolutely

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,140
know if you were in this 10-block part

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,140
of the city these were the eligible

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,570
likely voters for that day and it

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,579
totally kicked the other side but but

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,320
you know and this isn't that's not the

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,420
picture of a guy you would think could

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,360
be a CTO of a major organization well

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,710
maybe this room would because we're all

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,280
we're all dressed in self clothes here

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,079
it's that cool and that's taking the

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,259
world i love to do is pack for an open

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,380
source conference right let's say you

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,170
got my gamma 2 two pairs of shorts and

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:10,709
four shirts and some underwear i think

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:14,010
i'm good all right so anyway let's pull

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:19,830
up the let's get going with the

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:22,379
presentation I am I did bring it on PC

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,300
last year itself with the same pogoplug

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,489
by the way Jason were you here for that

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,680
yeah that's probably because it was

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:37,319
sunday at two forty-five and everybody

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:40,160
was on a plane so I learned from my

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,160
experiences

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,440
and it's showing full screen on my

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,440
display but not there

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,650
oh well okay thank you

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,220
alright let's try that again

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:40,590
apologize for the technical difficulties

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,220
now I didn't do it I got it I got a full

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,220
screen of mine

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,630
ok

00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,810
there we go

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,509
that's gonna be really short

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,360
you gotta be kidding

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,220
it's showing full screen on my display

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,970
ma'am

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,580
alright

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,590
this one this is my punishment for not

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,590
learning X the right way

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,780
sweet

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:20,600
so it I guess it thinks this is a dual

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:20,600
dual display okay so let's see

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,560
arey though I system settings

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:42,240
displeased then all you got to do is

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,240
just mirror this plate yeah

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,820

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:27,420
headless arch linux on a pogoplug i am

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:34,810
ben francis and this is the correct date

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:38,350

can guess what the acronym stands for

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,840
free and open source software experts

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,420
smush them together phosphorus yay

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:56,140
funded by hundreds of dollars of venture

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:58,170
capital bad joke dinner first time I

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,560
heard about heard about linux was

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:06,730
working for mci back in 1995 and

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,080
somebody was talked by he you know unix

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,470
counts three hundred eighty thousand

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,770
dollars per copy is there any way we can

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:17,550
just uh you know have a units that we

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,680
can play with and everybody said well no

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,330
ATT and I mean they don't like that so

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,510
but there is this thing called linux

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,550
that you can download and put on your

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,000
put on your laptop and it'll run just

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,460
like yours oh okay all right so put the

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,650
put the bug in my mind first Congress

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,710
ever went to was linux from high school

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:44,770
two thousand new york city anybody there

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:47,260
huh anybody nope okay um and it was i I

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,150
have to know that because I went to the

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,720
conference they had this big chart of a

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,160
the linux kernel on the wall and it was

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,660
the most complicated thing I had ever

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,660
seen in my life you don't want his big

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,940
ring diagrams with all the with

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,220
everything in the world on earth at the

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,630
linux kernel did at the time which is

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,360
which is a lot and just think how it's

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,650
how far has come in 14 years but i'm

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,800
looking at this chart and there's a

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:14,850
blonde haired dude um looking a lot like

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,800
me you know standing next to me with his

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:22,880
wife and his brand-new baby

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,510
and I'd only seen one picture of linen

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:30,920
store balls my whole life and man that

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:38,149
looks a lot like that guy that is Lana

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:40,430
store boss and so he was just regular

00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:45,589
dude hanging out in conference he

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:47,360
started his software and obviously I

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,420
think like a lot of the guy and we all

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,740
do too that's why we're all here very

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,240
self-effacing guy last thing about me is

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm the president of the columbia linux

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,329
user group we have a mint a mailing list

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:08,180
like most lugs do and we do have a

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:09,709
website Cole org and if you're ever in

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,899
Columbia and you want to give us talk on

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:17,779
anything anything at all I'm always

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:26,630
looking for speakers so everybody knows

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:28,190
this Berlin Wall 1989 November 9th 1980

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,610
yeah well actually this is probably

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,760
November 10th because wall came down and

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,040
there it was just blew everybody's mind

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,190
well why am i showing it at this arch

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,470
linux pogoplug presentation huh what is

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,120
this have to do with anything well it

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,120
has as a logically

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,730
I am right in the middle of all these

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:56,790
people right there I can't pick myself

00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:01,079
out but but guarantee i was there at

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:05,399
night i was young officer in the in the

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:07,920
in the Army at the time and my point my

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,549
place of duty was having to be berlin

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,290
germany just six months before and then

00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:19,920
six months later the wall came down so

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:22,470
you know you're welcome for all that but

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,279
i mentioned this because this was the

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:29,489
the jubilation an absolute freedom of of

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:33,079
a country that had that that used to

00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,079
look like this this was two years before

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:44,369
and I compare it to walking into a

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:50,519
black-and-white postcard this is Berlin

00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:52,290
90s 1987 on the East German side ok this

00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,179
is East brother you know this the city

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:59,369
of Berlin was divided into four sectors

00:11:54,179 --> 00:12:01,860
French in the north-west British in the

00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:04,829
middle and the Americans in the south

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,350
southwest and then the whole east side

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:09,569
of the city was East Berlin and of

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:14,339
course the entire city was inside East

00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:17,160
Germany you might know that the whole

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,319
city was in some was 110 miles inside

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,959
East German so it effectively was an

00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:25,259
island and the only way you get to that

00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,439
Island was by flying in or traveling the

00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:35,489
special audubon from from checkpoint

00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:38,819
alpha to checkpoint Bravo to checkpoint

00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:40,769
truck everybody knows by checkpoint

00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:43,259
charlie but it was a choke point Raul

00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:45,449
and checkpoint alpha also a little bit

00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,139
of trivia if you were every asset in

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:51,100
Trivial Pursuit

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:53,980
but anyway this is the country where

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:59,439
half the population was spying on the

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,910
other half right and and really not even

00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:04,359
getting paid for it you know they just

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,649
don't the threat they're only reason why

00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:07,389
they were doing it is because they

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,220
weren't going to get thrown in jail if

00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,739
they did if they refuse that we get

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,919
thrown into jail and it was absolutely

00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:18,939
no comics weren't going on see that one

00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:24,429
person right there the border one and

00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:27,730
the lower left that was that was normal

00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:29,290
you know it it actually was kind of an

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,119
anomaly because nobody was running her

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,589
walking around there was no comments at

00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:34,419
all there was no money no money changing

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,839
hands no free commerce look enough like

00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:39,339
that it was just once a week you went to

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,619
the store and got your food and you went

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:47,259
back to your apartment and you ate it

00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:50,859
okay and and this was all surveilled by

00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:55,660
an organization called the Stasi which

00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:59,309
was the East German secret police and I

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,749
just have to think about how how

00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,749
incredibly happy the Stasi would have

00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:07,839
been to have ninety-nine point nine

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:11,259
percent surveillance of their entire us

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:15,220
of the entire population of the East

00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:20,019
Berlin and East Germany and that's what

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:22,980
we have that's what we have today we got

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:26,410
in the NSA Brian's body we got 99

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,850
percent of the population surveilled in

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,899
their PowerPoint presentations to

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:35,489
themselves that is what Snowden revealed

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,489
in Glenn Greenwald

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,450
apparently they weren't watch one guy

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:51,650
so this this kind of ticked me off a lot

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,270
a lot and as I'm sure it did everybody

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:59,090
knew him I mean we kind of knew about it

00:14:53,270 --> 00:15:01,820
then we in 2006 an engineer a network

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:05,060
engineers blew the whistle went to NPR

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:08,570
and said hey I just saw some guy walk

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,580
into a building on the west coast and i

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,100
think it was san francisco and put in a

00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,320
dumb switch that copies all of the inner

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,270
internet traffic what's coming in from

00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,270
the west coast to the building next door

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,640
why else would he do that unless you

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,350
know in the building next door didn't

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:35,300
have any signs that or nothing it was

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:39,050
going to say um and so we you know we

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:41,090
had to think well they're watching the

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,490
traffic what were they is we don't we

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:46,690
don't know but you know now we know

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:51,970
because of Edward Snowden no was the NSA

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:54,260
and but you know just the realization of

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,090
Snowden publishing his papers and saying

00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:03,350
oh yeah it's it's that bad and worse

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:07,040
they're just the government is watching

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:14,480
everything we do for no good purpose not

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:16,760
one terrasen said was was disrupted by

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,000
this by this mass surveillance we

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,410
certainly did not been for it I mean I

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,710
guess I guess it's kind of nice having

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:27,890
your whole life backed up to data to a

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,940
database in in Utah but you know hundred

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,180
years from now that might be valuable

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:38,120
but right now it's is concerning

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:40,010
we've always loved privacy and you know

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,920
we can put it in the Constitution right

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:50,540
fourth amendment will be secure in our

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:56,779
personal effects and papers right that's

00:16:50,540 --> 00:17:00,920
what it says so um so I started to think

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:05,630
about well okay everybody the reason

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:08,900
this is all happening is because we kind

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,390
of customs ourselves to getting used to

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,559
the cloud right and I'm I'm as guilty as

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,300
anybody yeah 2009 I signed up for gmail

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,390
like a lot of other people did hey it's

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,970
great service and in one of my linux

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,860
user group members says you know do you

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,870
really do you really want to answer the

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,330
do you really want Google to answer the

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,890
phone for you and hand it to you and say

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,630
okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:39,470
listen to this while you've all you talk

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:42,740
as well but the convenience the

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,130
convenience is so good I just want to I

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,990
just I just want the convenience and

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,400
that would be so cool you know have only

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,990
instead of just having a whole bunch a

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,550
list of emails just have everything

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:57,850
packed in one conversation and all wife

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,160
would be happy and I can just kind of

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,900
push off the as a plausible deniability

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,870
that they're listening to everything a

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,320
lot of course they work and they're

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:12,679
doing it because they want to market

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,720
they want to mark it to you they might

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,740
see a movie called the terms and

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,770
conditions may apply yeah some netflix

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,680
you gotta see it you got to see it go to

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,750
nip yeah

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,100
I hate to be made to be showing for

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,470
netflix here because they're probably

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,000
watching him they absolutely no it all

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,630
the movies that watches that's for sure

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,230
but I'm willing to give that one but

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,430
yeah terms and conditions may apply

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,490
couple producers did a documentary on

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,530
facebook and google and and actually

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,560
follow market zuckerberg down the street

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:53,370
and soccer birds like are you filming me

00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:55,470
are you following me and soon as soon as

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,220
the producer says oh no i'm not telling

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,440
you this face turns all begging

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,650
brightnesses oh that's good in the

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,560
videos this is see that see that that's

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,990
how Mark Zuckerberg felt when he knew I

00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,690
wasn't what when he knew I wasn't

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,790
feeling him but it was just like Mark

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,640
Zuckerberg does when you go on facebook

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,920
and and like something or if you just go

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,760
to a web page and the like button is on

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,990
there he still knows you went there you

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,390
don't even have to be a part of facebook

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:31,170
as long as the like button is on that

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:33,330
page Mark Zuckerberg knows knows were

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,090
there I mean he personally doesn't know

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,840
what his organization is and that's why

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,330
you facebook is worth four billion

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,650
dollars the producers of the movies said

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:48,300
hey your personal information is not is

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:53,250
worth about five hundred dollars here at

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,780
least so I mean I hadn't really thought

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,370
about it that obvious I would say well

00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,960
maybe you know ten or twenty dollars a

00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,490
year maybe something like that no it's

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,380
worth a lot more than that because you

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,070
think about you know your salary every

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:09,080
salary in the US is $50,000 one percent

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,080
of that yeah okay I can see that

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,810
so so yeah go see the movie and then

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,610
that's what kind of ticked off this

00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,060
whole this whole presentation I said

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:27,590
well you know I I did the bringing home

00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:29,270
PC to itself last year as well this

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,790
would be a good topic to talk about

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:36,440
because you know everybody's trying to

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:39,470
do cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud and if

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:46,060
it's a US company and it's a clown

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:49,220
provider you just have to assume that

00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,460
that they if they're big enough they've

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:57,680
been pressured to release their data to

00:20:51,460 --> 00:21:03,560
to three-letter agencies right Bob a bit

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:07,310
CEO got pressured and to his everlasting

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:12,440
credit said no I'm not going to give up

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:16,720
my secret keys to you NSA and and they

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,720
shot him down right

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:25,330
so if the one good guy in the pack you

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:30,190
know shuts down what is everyone else

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:32,050
doing well they were they said meeting

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,550
businesses they obviously made a deal

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,010
with the devil said being in business is

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:40,800
better than not being in business we're

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:42,970
just going to play ball I don't mean to

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,580
bring everybody down here and we all

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,870
know this Elmo's and we have to talk

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,160
about these things right we're also

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,320
we're not going to figure out ways ways

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,420
around it this is this is my feeble

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,470
attempt right now to try to get around

00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:03,580
it I'm sure a security expert out there

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,010
but is going to say you know you're just

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,430
peeing in the wind on this one but and

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:12,250
it may be true but the knowledge of how

00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,270
to do these things is still important we

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,400
should and we should get it out there

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,830
and talk monster selves and and use

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,700
great distributions like like arch that

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,070
are made for small embedded devices and

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,200
it's a process kind of like you know you

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,560
can't just have peace in one day you got

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,860
its a peace process privacy is the same

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,170
thing all right so I put out an email to

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,180
my latest user group said I'm going to

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,460
start weaning myself off of Google

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,830
products right I'm going to start going

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,400
to DuckDuckGo instead of google for

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,700
searching right and i'm going to start

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,910
i'm not going to I'm going to try to

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,380
I'll still look at gmail just to it

00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,820
still got a lot of people that email me

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,780
in it but i'm going to set up my own

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,360
server and that's what i did about it i

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:06,280
bought a server virtual private server

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:09,430
yes it's in the cloud but i did that for

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,710
fonts person and i'm starting to use

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:15,940
that and get things on my own terms and

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,980
the pogoplug is wonderful because i do

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,740
have a big server sitting on my living

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,560
room forward but it's also got a big

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,180
sticker on it says this server uses 700

00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:30,780
watts

00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:33,700
and run the numbers on that hold on

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,200
let's say let's say it's not 700 wives

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,920
but it's 400 watts and that top

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:43,720
calculations as well okay and 2400 watts

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:47,230
25 20 times 25 days and 30 30 days in

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,080
the month bye-bye thousand and x 12

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,780
cents which is the rate in colombia for

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,370
electricity and you get thirty four

00:23:52,780 --> 00:24:02,500
dollars a month just to run that server

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:04,360
and 400 watts may be high or low but

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,790
that fact well you know I really don't

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,520
want to run that to every it's noisy and

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,880
all that stuff let's just get the run on

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:18,040
a pogoplug which is five watts and uses

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:22,540
forty three sets of my right and that'll

00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:26,440
be the start of weaning my way off of

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:29,740
google so i don't do facebook anymore I

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,310
know it's impossible just just to leave

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:36,400
the service so I just you know it's just

00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:40,750
like a dead tombstone out there okay I

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,520
stopped using gmail except for some

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,470
stuff like I said I'm weaning myself off

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,410
of it and then then I found out that

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,810
ubuntu this is this distribution i'm

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,880
using right now is playing the same game

00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,320
in a way because they have a program

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,430
running in the background called

00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,610
zeitgeist and researchers aight guys and

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:04,630
find out then zeitgeist knows everything

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:08,320
that you're doing in is is a report in

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:10,510
that to the dash you start a started

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:16,180
program from dash then that gets

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:20,950
reported back to canonical so that's on

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:25,930
my list of things to do and then last

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:28,810
thing is encryption in columbia were the

00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:31,840
lug the lug there is totally focused on

00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,530
figuring out how to do how to do PGP and

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,850
open PG

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:39,670
p correctly every every third meeting we

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,860
are doing security security security how

00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:46,060
do we do security how do we do how do we

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:48,790
generate keys how do we sign email so

00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:51,670
that you know that the the email came

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:56,860
from me howdy sorry about that how do

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:59,020
you how do you actually the email

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,380
so they can't be read what kind of what

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:08,500
kind of size key should you use 4096

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:10,420
because he can get so yeah that's that's

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,180
what we're focusing on down at the end

00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,690
of Columbia Law so yeah so privacy is a

00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,490
process and and it's one of these things

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,310
you just have to decide to do you can't

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:26,200
do it in one day let's help each other

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:28,500
along in the process so you gotta fight

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,440
black you got to fight back with the

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,440
with the antique loud and you could call

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,510
the antique loud just how we used to do

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,400
things or how he should have been doing

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,250
things before long came off you know a

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,490
lot of people hosted their own email

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:51,730
servers on home at home and got an IP

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:54,370
and and use the dynamic dns of two to

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,290
keep that IP you know constant working

00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:00,370
with with some kind of known dns name

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:04,380
that's how we used to do it I mean

00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,380
that's what we should go back to doing

00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,290
so so what about what about the pogoplug

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,150
that's that's attractive well um it's

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:18,700
headless it doesn't have it doesn't have

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:21,610
a monitor right so I can just an

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,400
everyday but today SSH to it and in

00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,170
figure out which was you know what's

00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,440
running in the background is running at

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:31,000
run level three which is normal for arch

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,170
that is the default for our science

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,290
isn't it

00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:40,670
oh yeah that's right okay yeah jason

00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,290
said the technically it's running on

00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,780
system d so there's no such thing as

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:48,410
wrong level 3 but anyway I've got it

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:52,220
configured so it just it doesn't have X

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:57,460
installer that's all right oh yeah yeah

00:27:52,220 --> 00:28:03,650
yeah multi-user target is is the actual

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:06,710
run level for this thank you Jason so

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:10,880
yeah it's cheap that particular program

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:15,140
pod right there is the e 0 to model it i

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,290
bought it for twenty-five dollars cloud

00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,820
engines was is a company that produces

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,990
those things and they they initially

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,060
tried to sell it for a hundred dollars

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,800
and had a whole bunch left over and just

00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:28,130
decided to get rid of them for 25 bucks

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,920
and all right well otherwise it would be

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,920
a Raspberry Pi and then hook up to a

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,600
month and see what's going on but but

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,820
it's okay I don't need to be running a

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,760
monitor running all that power anything

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,070
its power efficient five watts and the

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,200
nomenclature haven't tested myself has

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,280
anybody actually tested one of these

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,770
things to see how much power they

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,770
actually do draw nobody okay

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:07,580
up to 8 watts okay so compare that to a

00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:09,830
700 watt you know rack server and you

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,710
know it's a win all the way you know one

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:16,970
one-hundredth of power of what you'll be

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:20,000
using then on a bagel server of course

00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,350
it doesn't scale it's it's not going to

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,830
scale but it's only designed for one

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:27,230
person so it's a server for one person

00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:31,970
perfect I'm not serving ten tens of

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:36,860
thousands of people just me it uses the

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:41,180
ARM architecture at this particular

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,560
model has a Marvel 1.2 Gators chip there

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:48,250
is another model that has a different

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,250
ship what's it what's the other chip me

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:59,680
plx ox net ok it's run in the oxide chip

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,810
they're both good chips this one doing

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,820
great for me doesn't need cooling or

00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,420
well I mean of course it needs cooling

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,190
with its all passive cooling and it's

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:13,270
great little device that gigabit

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:16,120
ethernet and four USB ports what does it

00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,920
run well it's running archlinux Tom and

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,690
I didn't know anything about arch linux

00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,430
field you know probably 18 months ago

00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,380
when I needed a distribution that would

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:28,720
fit on that there's others but this is

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,270
just happen to be the one with the best

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,360
documentation arch is known as the

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,740
distribution with with the with great

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,830
documentation in fact other

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,420
distributions many times will refer to

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,040
arch documentation if you want to know

00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:47,520
if you want to know how to do something

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:55,990
so just for that alone it's gold mine

00:30:47,520 --> 00:31:00,250
iptables run NFS openldap Samba the

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:06,400
Apache web server is Ronnie and and

00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:08,260
postfix so you know all this great

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,720
software is running on advice night that

00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:17,230
I did a I did a Iran top on the machine

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,870
just to you know expecting that you know

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,860
the sort of eighty eighty-five percent

00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,620
fascinate or something like that and

00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:29,100
five percent

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,920
sir it's all that stuff running five

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,870
percent wish I could show you right now

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,180
I mean we might be able to debug it

00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:40,230
later and be able to see what's running

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,520
on but yeah I mean of course it wasn't

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,620
really doing anything just had the

00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,470
programs you know loaded and ready to go

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,020
but still even with that five percent

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:55,140
CPU and maybe maybe twenty-five percent

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:57,180
memory again the server's only got one

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,450
client so it doesn't have to it can run

00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,760
a whole bunch of programs because it's

00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,130
only going to serve me yeah that's it

00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:10,670
one mailbox you know one openldap

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:15,660
session s you know one ssh session

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:22,559
that's it simple we did the cost

00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:24,300
comparison in here I wanted to do a

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,000
little do a little demo but what this

00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,660
this little guy can do this kind of ties

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,850
him to what what I was doing

00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:37,530
presentation I did last year about how

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:41,360
the pogoplug with apache HTTP server on

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:44,190
it can actually serve as a boot server

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,230
so you can actually move from pogoplug

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:51,240
and let's go go ahead through through

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:56,220
through these three programs DNS mass

00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:00,300
Apache and I pixie DNS mass serves as

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:04,410
the tftp server and it also specifies

00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:06,440
where the I pixie program is located so

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,440
that

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:15,250
machine can then load I pixie which

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:17,170
allows it to do HTTP once it once it's

00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:22,540
able to do HTTP then it can download

00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:25,900
very efficiently an image from from the

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:29,460
network and go ahead and boot this right

00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:31,690
here is very old gateway laptop probably

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:38,680
two thousand four miles yeah ten years

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:42,120
ten years old and let's go ahead and see

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,120
if it can boot

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,720
are we doing on time

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:29,419
40 more minutes all right excellent okay

00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:32,790
it isn't quite we're missing the first

00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:35,879
first four characters of this way which

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:45,450
is kind of important because it says the

00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:49,710
ACP and if you ever get this what you

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:52,200
should be saying is I just want this

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,419
says client and VA CP and so is trying

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,589
to get dhcp from the network it's not

00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:57,589
it's not getting it

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,270
okay so

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,200
so it fell back to the default

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:19,500
distribution on here which is which is

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,880
debian so and the reason that is

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,390
happening is because we do not have

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:29,369
program running called called a DNS mask

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:38,460
and need to be a sensation know what to

00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:46,349
do that well well let's try it we got we

00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:50,670
got some founders yeah

00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:54,119
second demo I was going to do is was was

00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:56,809
doing openldap query these are the

00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:01,069
references for that I'm going to

00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:01,069
minimize that and go to

00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,839
Oh

00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:33,269
okay I kind of flew through my through

00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:35,939
my slides and I ended up on that and a

00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:43,759
question slide this would be a good time

00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:47,269
they ask four questions oh I'm sorry

00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:47,269
thank you thank you

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:14,530
I don't see any see questions about the

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:14,530
setup as I got going now anyway okay

00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,890
storage why's he had noted using the

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,530
random extern to a half-inch drive or

00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,850
whatnot

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:28,650
to it yeah d do is that you preferred

00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,210
additional storage thing KY sound like a

00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,640
little USB stick in there something to

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,500
eat dash do you prefer how do you for

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,390
doing that and from the cloud

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,710
perspective do you do any sort of i want

00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,410
to say dropbox it's not the end of a

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:48,210
cloud storage synchronization type stuff

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:51,690
yeah it's very much a work in progress

00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:54,150
right now what when i did have this

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,300
pogoplug who talked to was a 1.5

00:37:54,150 --> 00:38:05,220
terabyte drive that was formatted with

00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:06,450
ntfs and i thought well you know i got a

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,530
whole bunch of pictures on it because my

00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,140
wife had soared a whole bunch of

00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:13,290
pictures on the sin ti on this ntfs

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,810
formatted drive and said well I really

00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:20,160
don't know if NFS could can conserve

00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:23,460
this this anti vest formatted drive I

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,900
mean it should be up to but I didn't

00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,330
know but I wanted to prove it so said

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,450
well instead of me taking all that date

00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:32,820
off and reformatting it as ext3 and just

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:37,140
said well let's let's just leave it as

00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:42,990
ntfs and see if NFS conservative turns

00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:45,860
out again it's just the design of NFS

00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:49,020
that it doesn't care about how the

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:53,070
server itself is storing the data as

00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:55,760
long as it can get it you know and and

00:38:53,070 --> 00:39:01,950
with NTFS you get the permissions that

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:06,300
that fat32 doesn't have so that's why

00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:08,220
that's not well it should work issue its

00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,550
work relatively well that way but I

00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,990
didn't want to carry a 1.5 terabyte

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,850
drive and have an even bigger

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,300
complications so I just replace it with

00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,060
the

00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:24,870
16 gig thumb drive right there and ran

00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:27,350
NFS off of that so would it so get them

00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:30,630
getting back to your question is there a

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:35,310
way to hook it up to a drive in the

00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:38,570
cloud that you know some kind of secure

00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:41,760
way to hook it up to a driving a cloud

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:46,730
but if this is your clout replacement

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:50,220
yeah yeah yeah well i mean the the

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:51,960
terabyte drive is the is my cloud or

00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,850
pipe replacement you've got all the

00:39:51,960 --> 00:40:02,040
pictures and everything that that that i

00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:06,390
need to connect to and the way to to

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,080
connect with from say McDonald's or you

00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:14,130
know Starbucks or something like that is

00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:17,040
is a technique called you use the ssh

00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,590
tool and believe it I haven't I haven't

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,440
actually done it yet but but there's a

00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:25,560
there's a it's called ssh port port

00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,890
forwarding where you can tunnel back

00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:32,730
into this device from the from the

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:35,160
mcdonalds and know that all your your

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,560
internet traffic is being done through

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,170
that device instead of through mcdonalds

00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,220
Wi-Fi you know that's why you know they

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:47,220
can see the traffic but it's encrypted

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:49,670
it doesn't matter why yes Jason please

00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,670
there is

00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,980
obviously because it's also our lettings

00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,860
you can use any software package that is

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,500
capable being compiled and run on it so

00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,150
on cloud workers believe it or not we

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,380
teasing actually works on it it's not

00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,900
the fastest thing in the world on this

00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,850
little guy but it does work there are

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,080
multiple other option its own cloud and

00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:13,990
in particular is a php-based so you can

00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,510
configure it with engine X and php-fpm

00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:18,280
and use own cloud to do the syncing with

00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:22,060
that in addition to that you can and

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,890
reclaim you get an interactive html5 web

00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,680
page that you can use it has all the

00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,990
nice front end pieces that you'd use in

00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,520
a standard browser from a laptop tablet

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:35,560
etc so own cloud is one example it's one

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,510
that I've seen multiple use and I've

00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,710
seen it done more extensively we do have

00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,710
that active from the packaged

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:55,270
the other questions this is it's really

00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,860
ticking me off that I can't demo the

00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:01,760
being able to do the the network booting

00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:07,730
from from a pogoplug so so I'm gonna I'm

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:11,240
gonna figure this whole account laptop

00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,500
just I decided to die I'm going to

00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,170
figure this out and have it have it

00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,410
ready for if there's an extra birds of a

00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:21,260
feather going around now I'm going to

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:26,240
take up that one and be able to gentle

00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:31,010
with that at that time it was i was

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,990
working so great last night and then it

00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:36,800
was working here too I did that one

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:39,670
question so Haley yes so I guess part

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,920
one is looking at this

00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,540
pure cloud service this is more cloud

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,440
data but it wouldn't be good hosting for

00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,440
cloud services well yeah because

00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,550
as long as it's only certain one person

00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm good but as soon as soon as you get

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:04,720
over i'm guessing ten people that you

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,980
know the server is going to melt down

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:14,450
with all the stuff i get running on so

00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:22,940
yeah i just see it as as as a way to

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:24,890
learn how to how to run a distribution

00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:30,950
arch linux which is a rolling release

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:36,200
distribution as a server on and on a

00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:38,120
very small embedded device and people

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,470
would generally recommend that you not

00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:43,940
run rolling server release on just

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,280
because it's so hard to keep up and

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:51,620
every update it that you may make to the

00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,900
server is my great summer so i don't

00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:57,350
recommend it for production use but it

00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,030
is a great learning tool and i haven't

00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:04,040
had any problems with it so far you know

00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:09,040
knock on wood and of course i'm still

00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:11,690
learning about all this ssh foo the

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,200
what's really nice about ssh is that you

00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:18,580
can it eliminates the passwords so if

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,320
you use a program called ssh key gen

00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:26,330
will generate your public and private

00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:29,510
key pairs the public part of that that

00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:32,420
key is a separate file called usually ID

00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,090
underscore RSA dot that pub you take

00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:38,850
that key and put it on into a file

00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:42,900
called authorized keys

00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:45,930
this is a directory yeah okay so I'm you

00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,640
know talking really basic to a bunch of

00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,980
people that I already know all this is

00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,950
our follow-up question yeah don't

00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,330
understand that arch linux software for

00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,770
the Alpha and system though we didn't

00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,940
come on the embedded device right did

00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:04,170
you put that on there they come out the

00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:06,250
hard drive that was imposed install it

00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:10,380
comes with an advantage

00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,380
I think

00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:23,339
like it's fairly esoteric then

00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:34,699
so

00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,030
problem

00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:58,280
look into my marsh or

00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:12,559
yeah the I actually used the a web page

00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:14,799
to to build this arch distribution that

00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:20,059
that's not on the harsh lines wit wiki

00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:27,559
as published by a guy named Wai T land

00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:29,839
or Susan his handle is YT land and i'll

00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,949
get to her in the second month well my

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:36,529
laptop boots up but yeah i had to had a

00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:39,650
perfect it had this installed right here

00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:42,410
for this easy row to from soup to nuts

00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:45,979
and i just followed that recipe right

00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:49,729
down right down right down the page and

00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:55,069
it worked the things I had to do extra

00:46:49,729 --> 00:47:01,039
were installed openldap okay that took a

00:46:55,069 --> 00:47:03,079
full month of just you know just going

00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,719
back and back and forth trying new

00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,849
things and actually ended up writing a

00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:14,229
script that would that would in that

00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:14,229
would install openldap on arch linux and

00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:21,049
enable TLS authentication right in and

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,439
do all the configuration for you right

00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:27,049
out of the box and I posted that on the

00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:28,819
arch linux wiki if you search for arch

00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:30,890
linux and open all that you'll get right

00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:32,749
to that page and and you won't have to

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,459
go through that the heartache i did

00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:38,299
trying to get to open all that running

00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:41,749
on that on that box because everybody

00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:46,549
publishes a how-to page try to get

00:47:41,749 --> 00:47:49,400
openldap running non securely right okay

00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:52,369
but the last mile come on the last mile

00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,179
is the important part we want TLS we

00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:58,459
want secur security and in that that's

00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:00,650
the hard part but that script i

00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:05,599
published on open all that for four

00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:07,609
hours linux that does it of course after

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,430
that you then you gotta define europe

00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:16,720
your organization structure

00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:18,730
but at least you got the least you got

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,160
the openldap installed and configured

00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,450
and working okay I think you're able to

00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,400
answer my question somewhere in there

00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:26,020
and is that you're able to put basically

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,369
8 operating system on that through

00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,910
fairly normal means going to have to

00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:33,220
hack the device at all the basically is

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,510
rather simple they do allow you to go

00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,010
into their interface

00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:43,870
the ussa so you can either do that or

00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:46,090
you can attach 3.3 volts yeltsin a 3.3

00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:48,550
volt TTL serial to it and then you get

00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:51,610
basically a serial console log in right

00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:53,530
there you do it from there but you have

00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,780
to you can't just pop it in ISO and

00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,120
magically it works there is a slight bit

00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:02,200
more complication to it but beyond that

00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:04,720
is actually not that complicated it's a

00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,610
what maybe a six or a seven step process

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,320
which includes doing the download of

00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,320
whoever's root of s you're using

00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:21,600
wunderbar okay yeah in the in the

00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:23,370

not going to not going to hold you in

00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:12,720
the next presenter booth is the next

00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:15,740
presenter in here hey down once the next

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,780
presentation start is at nine fifteen

00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:28,780
all right yeah 1050 okay all right we're

00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:32,460
good we're good so let's try this again

00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,460
and while as well as

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,470
there's this is the link for the second

00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:15,070

third link that's the end of my

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,220
presentation thank you all for coming

00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:44,109
see me afterward if you got any other

00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:46,390
questions thank you your customers rely

00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,640
on your website or application if it's

00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:51,970
slower non-responsive it infuriates your

users and costs you money keeping your

00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:57,290
business critical systems humming along

00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:59,600
requires insight into what they're doing

00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:01,550
your system metrics tells stories

00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,560
stories that can reveal performance

00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,900
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,460
other problems but how do you keep an

eye on all of your systems performance

00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,160
metrics in real-time and record this

00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,900
data for later analysis enter longview

00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,910
the new way to see what's really going

00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,070

00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,600
of all your systems providing you with a

00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,960
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,540
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,310
load and network usage click a specific

00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,710
system to access its individual

00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:36,220
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:38,630
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,280
comprehensive network data including

00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,620
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,180
available on the network tab and disk

00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,100
rights and free space on the disk

00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,920
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:51,470
displays usage statistics for individual

00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,630
processes the system info tab shows

00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:55,880
listening services active connections

00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:58,010
and available updates adding long view

00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,720
to a system is easy just click the

00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,850
button copy the one line installation

00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,310
command then run the command on your

00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:05,990
linux system to complete the process the

00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:08,180
agent will begin collecting data and

00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,030
sending it to longview then the graph

00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,580
start rolling

00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:14,980
use longview to gain visibility into

00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:18,690
your servers so when your website or app

00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,690
