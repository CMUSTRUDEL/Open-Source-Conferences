the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,859
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,910
in 2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,970
possible thank you for coming to coder

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,520
non coders wanted your guest speaker is

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,980
Deb Nicholson she's community outreach

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,899
director at the open invention network

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:43,379
and community manager at GU media Goblin

00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:47,430
thanks a lot so for this time I'm going

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,140
to talk to both non coders who have been

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,570
hanging around and are like I wonder

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,219
what else I could be doing besides

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,920
learning to code in case someone already

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,109
mentioned that you might want to do that

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,660
you don't have to do that oh it's also

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,940
for folks who have coding project and

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,909
suspect that there are some things that

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,990
could be done by non coders around their

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,460
project so I don't know if anyone here

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,350
is at a project where they feel like

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,619
they have too many volunteers already

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,100
doing too much ok great so you're in the

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,500
right place so a pretty the first

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,509
question we get because like yes code is

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,820
important for a code project sure of

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:32,189
course but why do you need non coders

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,750
for me I think you think about well we

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,549
have a lot of the coders here already

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,030
when you go and you speak with folks

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,299
about about police offer about using

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:49,110
Linux they're already aware that we're

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,180
here so in order for more people to be

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,940
using Linux we need to be reaching

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,040
beyond

00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,350
a little bubble of folks that are like

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,900
oh yeah I already hack on the colonel

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,540
like that's not going to be enough

00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,790
people if you think about like windows

00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,730
being it likes 90 some percent of the

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,550
desktop like we've did we could get in

00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,170
there and bring those folks over so that

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,760
they can come spend the weekend with us

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:18,970
in Charlotte so I also think that having

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,670
like kind of a diversity of ideas and

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:25,270
thoughts just it just makes better ideas

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,430
better solutions you I'm sure everyone

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,350
here has had that experience where

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,330
they're tootling along doing something

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,430
and someone else comes in is like huh

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,010
why'd you decide to do it all backwards

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,700
and you're like uh

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,370
and so having a couple people to look at

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,200
stuff I mean that's sort of how the

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,610
whole thing with open source works is

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,459
having lots and lots of people looking

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,980
at that source code but I think it works

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,409
also for projects in general like not

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,780
just having multiple folks coming from

00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:59,709
the same discipline but multiple folks

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,140
coming from all over the place so for

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,629
instance when I met some of the folks

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,200
from the twisted project at the boston

00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,819
python meetup and and I asked glyph

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,560
who's one of the project leads they're

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,540
like so what's twisted too and he said

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,970
oh it says on the website I'm like oh it

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,379
does okay great I'll look it up it's

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,720
weird a hackfest so everyone's got their

00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,459
computer open and in again in the twist

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,519
inside and they have like a list of

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,280
components that are part of twisted and

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,690
I said yep that so there's like a list

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,700
of components and they all have these

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,859
weird names like tornado and some

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,540
acronyms and nice ikea that's what

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,760
twisted is and I'm like but I don't know

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,030
what any of those mean and then he's

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,560
like um well maybe maybe our products

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,870
for people who already know they need it

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,629
and I'm like so they like they like

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,870
enter this earth like through the berk

00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:51,549
now like and then it's only a matter of

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,989
time before they come find twisted

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,980
because they're going to grow up to be a

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,419
sysadmin like I don't know maybe you're

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,599
not getting the most out of your website

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:03,940
there so and even realize that because

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,579
for him all of those words like the the

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,400
components of twisted meant things for

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,410
me of being new to it I was like those

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,590
those don't mean what you think they

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:18,070
mean so it's in perspective for outside

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,950
of like your your regular beat here's

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,160
some of these

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,050
non potes like to do I look at the open

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,870
invention network so we we help folks

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,540
with legal stuff like sorting out patent

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,260
risk and ameliorating that but you know

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,690
we also can folks to stop in a loop to

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,770
proofread a document to fundraise I

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,350
don't know if you have a project that

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,760
has too much money I can help you with

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,980
that but if you have a project that does

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,450
not have too much money you might need

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,430
someone to help me raise some money

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,790
that's one of the things that I help

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,660
media goblin with you know testing and

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,280
data testing and doing QA you know all

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,870
of these different types of things like

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,150
you don't need to know how to code to do

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,310
any of them and in fact like it would be

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,170
hard to find time to do a significant

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,450
amount of documentation and translation

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,390
as well as a significant amount of codes

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,190
so so those are some of the things and

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,200
then these are pictures of people you

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,330
know actually doing those things you can

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,260
be able to code to dress up as a fox

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,840
probably not but you know so these are

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,500
all like places where we can we can use

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,300
non codes so for freedom to build the

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,370
free software movement with to get more

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,500
folks and and a little bit better

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,590
marketing and maybe some nicer websites

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,810
and money wouldn't hurt so the reason

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm giving this talk is because I

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,570
originally started out as a non coder

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,340
that organized other non coders so I did

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,860
local political work in Massachusetts

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,690
where either um so I learned all of this

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,060
like how you work with volunteers and

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,220
how you get people to come back again as

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,630
opposed to grumble about the grumpy lady

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,960
that made me stuff all the envelopes and

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,850
all that type of thing uh so I got a job

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
at the Free Software Foundation and then

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,170
it was a non coder organizing coders

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,330
like getting them to show up at booths

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,050
and talk about the canoe project and

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,390
things like that so eventually I you

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,460
know before had gotten a job at the FSF

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,249
i had thought like coders wow they're

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,559
right

00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:20,039
magic they read this all these special

00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:22,049
symbols like and and there's like you

00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,549
know I had looked at some of the some of

00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,069
the products like i was looking at

00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,409
software for the licensing stuff and I

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,839
was like versus pages and pages like

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,819
yeah they must pretty much be mad it and

00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,869
then you know you eat lunch with people

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,269
and you see someone with like

00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:40,469
SpaghettiOs and you're like sort of the

00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:42,989
magic like like like you're smart but

00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:44,599
you're a real person okay so then I

00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:47,669
thought well maybe I could learn to code

00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,469
not because I don't spill SpaghettiOs I

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,719
definitely do they're messy that you put

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,699
um so I thought I'll go and I'll learn

00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:58,289
to code so then I started working with

00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:01,529
open hatch after I learned a code to to

00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:03,119
help folks learn to code for the first

00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,039
time as well so I learned I learned

00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:08,669
enough Python to teach other people how

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,679
to start on Python so you know then

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,739
we're kind of like completing the circle

00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:15,839
except that we don't really have coders

00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,969
doing such a great job of reaching out

00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,699
to non coders yet and you can see that

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:22,889
that seems looks sad that needs to come

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,809
and do documentation and raise money for

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,839
you and maybe put on a good new costume

00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:31,949
so um so where are we going to find that

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,719
to me you know it's a sometimes you

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,839
might not know what you aren't good at

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:39,299
like this is one of those examples like

00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,399
so maybe you've been you know kind of

00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:43,709
muddling along without non coders and

00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,619
you've been doing your own marketing

00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:48,639
your own website I saw the folks from

00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:51,699
the software freedom law center end

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,590
where their lawyers and then the lawyers

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,849
have something in common with coders in

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,199
this way where they're like well I'm

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,939
really smart and I went to school for a

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,099
while and people tell me I'm smart so

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,199
i'm probably good at most things so they

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,539
had gotten a booth for the first time

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,330
and they had this box which is on the

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,009
side of it it said kinkos and so late as

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,620
you roll up on their booth it looks like

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,360
they're tabling for kinkos and but i

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,919
knew them and I'm like you guys working

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,770
at Kinkos now and they're like what were

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,330
you talking about like no we made these

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,770
flyers and I'm like and you brought him

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,750
right over and didn't even take them out

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,370
of the box really I guess we should take

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,219
them out of the box so they take them

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,199
out of the box and it's this it's it's

00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:32,260
legal paper haha because they're lawyers

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,000
and it's all like one page like dense

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,719
with the margins push all the way out to

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,890
the edge no images no font

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,300
differentiation and then you flip it

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,849
over and it goes about a third or a

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:48,459
quarter on the back on the other side

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:51,130
and didn't have any contact info so I'm

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,410
like well it's cool that you guys

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,260
decided to start telling people that you

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,600
work but I mean you live in New York

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,730
City there must be a person that owes

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,120
you a favor your lawyers for God's sakes

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:08,079
that can help you make a flyer that is

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,000
this better so so even you know and I'm

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,949
not saying don't try new things like you

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,779
can you can be you can be a hacker that

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:15,490
what's up a mean soufflé that's great

00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:17,829
but like if there's something that

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,050
you're like well there's no one else to

00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,880
do it before you jump in maybe maybe

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,149
check and see if it's someone else's a

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,910
thing that they're good at giving these

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,360
people who knows what you need it might

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,209
not be you so i recommend like maybe if

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,100
you have a project you're like man i

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:39,220
wish that we could be more like debian

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,920
or whatever it is like maybe it's media

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,079
goblin i don't know but once you figure

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,630
out oops there goes that soda don't open

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,550
that one for a while um but once you

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,680
figure out what that project you would

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,600
like your project to be more like figure

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,579
out how they're doing it

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,709
don't even say take them to lunch and be

00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:59,730
like how do you guys get so many interns

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:02,949
or why is your website look amazing

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,360
whatever that is like go ahead and you

00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,190
know figure out where they got that bone

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,850
and maybe you can replicate it for

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,670
yourself you also want to make it really

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,649
easy for people to find you so the

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,230
website like twisted website i was

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,480
talking about that's no one knows unless

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,459
they have already met you and spoken to

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,350
you it like that that they have finally

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,949
found the right place like oh this is

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,449
that like project what is it and i'm not

00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,870
to make it easy for people to get

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,300
started so if you if you've got like

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,399
maybe you know you need translation like

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,319
setup transifex and put it on the front

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,290
page mention it in your blog post like

00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:43,089
you know like we're we're really

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,009
grateful for our translators and if

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,019
anyone wants to help us with Italian and

00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,389
German and Russian like you know please

00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,680
let us know so you're like specific and

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,959
you're saying exactly what it is you

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,959
need and then it's not then when someone

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,300
shows up or not like um shoot the stuff

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,009
I need you to translate round here

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,889
somewhere just hold on for like two

00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:04,630
weeks not the best so you want to make

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,329
it like once you figure out what you

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,240
need like put it out there might have to

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,040
do some documentation yourself and just

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
make it easy for folks to get started uh

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:20,709
if this is a roadside not so great you

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,600
might need a website designer so uh you

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:24,160
know and and finding a website designer

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,019
that's like one of those jobs where

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,019
people they want to have something to

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,730
put on their resume so like you know you

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,699
might get someone's first website might

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,069
look a little fun maybe wild like shiny

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:40,670
but it'll still look better than that

00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:46,010
other one is there so um hmm

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:49,070
so non coders I think they're kind of

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,790
the same as coders in some ways in that

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,350
they want to put stuff on their resume

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,290
they want to meet new people they want

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,170
to learn new things you know they want

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,780
to get stuff done they want to you know

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,870
maybe like do something nice for the

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,310
world like feed puppies help orphans all

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,680
those kinds of things like they're

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,140
they're regular people like you need um

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,660
but they're also a little bit different

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,850
so like the thing that maybe excites a

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,580
coder about their project is like we're

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,280
using this brand new no SQL database

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,320
that no one's even heard of you tell

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,000
your potential non-code or volunteer

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,620
about that and then you're like plus

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,380
we're going to you know we're going to

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,060
do it with this like mashup of Haskell

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,030
and Python it's going to blow your mind

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,100
they're like what is it what does it do

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,260
I don't even you know you're talking

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,620
about how it does what it does what did

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,240
you say to non coder like oh it helps

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,400
doctors and patients communicate more

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,960
effectively or it helps independent

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,210
musicians get their music out there

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,450
without having to be yoked to a major

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:56,270
label or you know it helps people share

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,130
pictures of cats around the world even

00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,650
you know at least that's the what it

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,990
does and not the how it does it so i

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,270
would suggest when you're crafting your

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,040
your ask like hey can you come to a

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,100
bunch of free work for us not encoder

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,900
that you maybe keep the new SQL part to

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:17,720
yourself everyone clear on that one yes

00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,490
fantastic so you also want to try and

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,260
speak a person's language with your mom

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,690
need to slide sometimes i give this talk

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,690
with her we both like Ryan Gosling

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:34,209
what serious cannon you know about about

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:37,660
what stuff um but some of the things

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:39,959
about language like we're um if you if

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,389
you're like I don't want a person to

00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:46,269
website like do you need a designer or

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,220
do you need like a builder so you kind

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:52,989
of got to figure out the language in the

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:55,749
area enough to get the right person one

00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:58,389
of the things that I when I started

00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:01,089
doing free software stuff a lot of my

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:03,389
background is in fundraising which we

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:06,189
call development in the nonprofit sector

00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,139
so people are like oh so you're working

00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:09,459
on that stuff now and I'm like yeah yeah

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,559
they hired me because I've been doing

00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:13,239
development for like 15 years and

00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,179
they're like oh and then i would get

00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:18,209
this stream of words and i was like mmm

00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:21,129
yeah none of those are about money or

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:22,989
memberships I don't like yeah and then

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:24,879
it looked kind of like oh I said

00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:28,869
development I gave you this like I gave

00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:31,089
you the wrong cue um so it you know and

00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,350
it could be the same here so you kind of

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,629
want to look around and find out what

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,889
the lingo is enough to articulate your

00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:41,019
needs so actually finding them once you

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,269
once you've gotten ready you figured out

00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:46,149
like what you need we need what you're

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:48,819
going to call them your user base is a

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,350
great place to start people don't really

00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:52,600
come from no

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,310
this is this is not a scientific graph

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,050
this is kind of how I imagined like

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,900
people coming into the core of your

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:00,670
project you're not really going to get

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,440
people who haven't heard of your project

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,940
submitting bugs like how would they find

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,860
you right so if you kind of imagine this

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,900
this model of people coming in or you

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,910
can you can picture it like this like

00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,060
these exes or people that are not going

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,100
to contribute to your project so like

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,620
users and the people who recommend your

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,540
software and then folks the file bugs so

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,570
you want to make it really easy like

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,250
this is similar to the the funnel that

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,680
they talk about on like a sales website

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,960
like you have lots of people that skip

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,790
by and have like a like a marginal

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,170
amount of involvement and then you want

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,860
to get them all the way down to the end

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:40,690
so for our purposes that the sale is to

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,860
get them to become a contributor to our

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,810
project right so wooden things that you

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,840
might kinda wanna ponder here is like

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,480
are there any barriers along this path

00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,330
so you may have something here we're

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,470
like actually your your regular like

00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:02,080
lovely GUI facing website doesn't make

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,210
any mention of your bug stuff so like

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,010
someone might be like I found a bug I

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,380
went to the website it just had a

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,470
download link so I just kept the bug to

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,930
myself and never shared it so that

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,630
that's just like one example of like

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,480
what's keeping people from coming from

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,690
the the general use and recommendation

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,050
population into the contributing bug

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:30,310
filing maybe fundraising legal advice

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:32,470
part so another place that you can look

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,690
for non coders as friends and friends or

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:39,970
friends um we had a we had someone who

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,460
translated stuff into Arabic for us at

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,490
media Goblin and then you know we were

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,209
like wow so you're really great at this

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,559
we did

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,149
and you know we just put it out there

00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,860
like not that long ago do you know

00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:53,139
anyone else and he's like oh yeah I know

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,050
an Italian guy I know someone who does

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,629
portugee you know and so all of a sudden

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:03,069
we had like 17 languages in a project

00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:04,569
that's still beta so not too shabby you

00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:06,339
know Anna makes it easier for us to get

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,049
other contributors of all types in those

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,640
languages as well schools um maybe not

00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:14,199
in high schools but in other types of

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,870
schools I hear people go there because

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,980
they like learning um some folks are

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,899
probably in high school because they

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:25,659
like learning anyway I like tomorrow I

00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:28,630
didn't like high school though um that's

00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,890
probably not as as rare as I think but

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,169
school is a really great place because

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,390
people want to learn new things you

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:36,970
might also be able to get folks to do

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:40,110
something like an internship one thing

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:42,549
about internships is that they're not

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,309
they're not the pick up my dry cleaning

00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:48,039
like take my car to get wax kind of

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:50,620
thing and in fact in some places that's

00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:53,470
illegal to have interns do that for you

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,750
so like not only is it not a good idea

00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:00,640
because it doesn't make people excited

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:04,270
to recommend interning with you you you

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,659
might also get into legal hot water it's

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:10,419
it's also the the more substantive work

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,750
you have someone do as an internship the

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,649
more likely they are to stick around and

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,230
that's great because then you have

00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:19,210
someone who's like just a full-on you

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,029
know unpaid contributor all the time

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,100
like after the summer is over so if you

00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,690
give someone substantive work to do then

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,760
they're going to become invested in your

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,390
project won't talk a little bit more

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,370
about investment um you want to prepare

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,960
for their arrival so like when they get

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,760
there it's like oh I don't even know

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,740
where you're going to sit or if it's

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,080
looking you know if they're interning

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,820
for you remotely like oh you know you

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,520
want to have credentials ready for them

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,049
to post blogs or whatever it is you're

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,210
going to have them to you know have them

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,850
do you don't want to start out on the

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,710
footing of like oh man it's kind of a

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,909
pain in the ass to have you here even

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,909
though I know in the long run it's going

00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:00,220
to be better you know so just like all

00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,570
of that like I kind of like how do i set

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,020
up a new email address like do it before

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,510
they get there I think that clear is is

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,320
not is going to give people a good sense

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:13,029
of like what they're expected to do and

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,980
sort of it'll help them have ownership

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,470
over their area if you're like all right

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,360
so part of your internship is going to

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,730
read a blog once a week and then they

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,220
know and they're like none of your

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,350
internship is to pick up Dave's dry

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,080
cleaning that lazy jerk and then they

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,649
can help Dave like I'm not picking up

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,720
dry cleaning I was told I don't have to

00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:36,100
so you know and that's I don't even know

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,200
if anyone in this room ever gets

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,090
anything dry clean I never be but you

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,370
know that's that's like kind of the

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,899
quintessential intern example i'm sure

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,909
you can fill in the blank with something

00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:50,049
else menial that you would prefer

00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:53,200
someone else did for you but anyway this

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:55,870
is a great example the the new outreach

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,899
program for women you can see the

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:02,110
language like they they said support

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:05,649
software freedom not like a do grunt

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,299
work you know they they specifically

00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:10,870
mean the stuff that they're interested

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:12,279
in having folks do they have said could

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,010
be programming but it could also be

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,870
designed documentation marketing so they

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,270
like named exactly the task that they

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,500
think would be helpful and then you can

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,789
see like they're talking about

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,889
collaborating they're talking about

00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,870
community they make it clear that it's

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:30,419
open to everyone so the language here is

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,419
is good is it too small to read

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,820
oh yeah this isn't last meters actually

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,530
Molly did a graph so they've been doing

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,830
this for about three and a half years

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:49,790
they do two cycles of it so so this is a

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:51,800
newer project that works on getting yeah

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,620
good Noma like also they had this

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,690
realization a few just a few years ago

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,100
like we should formalize that thing

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,080
where we want folks to help us with

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,720
non-coding TAS and I think they've done

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,030
a pretty good job when you can see this

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,390
is the percentage of projects that were

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:11,360
non-code projects so and people have

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:13,700
been pretty excited about their their

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,640
results with that so you could you can

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,320
either try and get in on the gnome OPW

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,180
or you could try and clone it and do

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,900
something else like maybe rolling with

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:26,090
your own project so you you figured out

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,400
where to get them you figured out how to

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,040
make sure that you're ready for them to

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,590
arrive how do you keep them right so

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,560
that's I promised you getting them and

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,030
keeping them it's no good now like one

00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,130
of the things about interns everyone's

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,050
like oh yeah volunteers their break and

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,030
it's like if they only from diane de

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,130
like four hours of work and it took you

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,410
three hours to set it up for them like

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,060
not so great so you want to keep them

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,100
around long enough for it to be worth

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,830
your well it won't always a couple of

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,410
them will will fall by the wayside but

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:01,180
the goal is to get as many of them

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:04,810
across the finish line as possible right

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,810
so keeping them

00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:09,009
making them comfortable this is like the

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:11,590
obligatory cat side there might be one

00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:14,080
more but mediator that they feel

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,789
comfortable when when they come to your

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,460
project so that's like we talked about

00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:19,960
like not scrambling around remember like

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,320
we're there you know how you set up a

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,320
new email giving them like access to the

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,299
documentation that they need you know

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,509
introducing them around of the rest of

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:33,460
the team like with you know in in a

00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:35,440
thoughtful way you know like you know

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,029
this is Tom or this is Sarah they're

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,089
going to be helping us with the with the

00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:42,219
website this summer you know as opposed

00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:44,049
to like somehow we got this free person

00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:46,509
who's going to sit here you know so you

00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:49,450
can see like one is one is sounds nice

00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:51,129
and one doesn't sound so nice not that I

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,309
expect anyone in here would do the

00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:55,809
former I mean the latter they're

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,940
checking their lines of communication if

00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:01,149
everything in your project is

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,830
communicated on IRC and it's developer

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:05,469
channel and you don't have your

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,029
marketing folks or your blog posters or

00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:10,570
your documentaries or your translators

00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:11,320
on your IRC channel and then like you

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,049
and then you end up with a situation

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,789
where like everyone gets up at once and

00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:17,549
goes to the bar across the street like

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,839
at the end of the day and like in your

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:21,519
non coders just in around like what

00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,830
happened it's like one of those sci-fi

00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,779
movies were like the you know they flip

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,879
the switch and they all went out but

00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,950
what happened was someone said in IRC

00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:31,779
like is it time for beer yet yeah okay

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,820
but so if you're going to you're going

00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:37,419
to do that stuff or maybe it's something

00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,879
more important than beer after work then

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,580
move it to a mailing list or get your

00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:44,259
non coder to sign up for IRC and hang

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,169
out in the channel so one or the other

00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:50,109
like you can't have like a like a

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:53,649
project wide communication that doesn't

00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:54,820
include your non coders you can sure

00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:57,580
that you're saying things the way that

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,460
you are intending to say them one thing

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,839
like I found when I got to like the

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,519
software world everything is an acronym

00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:08,320
and no one ever like unpacked it and so

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:12,220
so you hear stuff and you're like yeah

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,960
yeah like well and so uh what I did and

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,419
don't make people do this this is kind

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,919
of silly um what I did was I wrote down

00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:19,720
all the acronyms I heard and then I

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,600
looked him up on Wikipedia at the end of

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,980
the day because no one was explaining

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:31,120
them and I didn't want to be like I

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:34,059
don't know what PCP is what Oh to do the

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,860
acronyms or to look them up yeah yeah

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,130
well this would be like an in-person

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,299
meeting I'm just saying if you use use

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,340
the same kind of thing that you would

00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:44,259
use in writing which is like if you

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,779
write an article the first time you say

00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:49,509
it out and then you're like you know

00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:51,879
it's also called TCP and then you can go

00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:54,399
on and use acronym put like just kind of

00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:58,000
a little bit of you know where with all

00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:02,080
their to no reason for it to sound

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,960
secretive give you people autonomy no

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,649
one likes to be micromanaged non coders

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,419
are no exception in this regard that

00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:12,009
means also like kind of letting them

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,980
tell you how long a task is going to

00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,440
take so I don't know if anyone here has

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,360
done any event planning it seems like

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,100
what happens is everyone shows up on

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,840
friday and the hotel just happens to be

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,460
ready but if you're doing the event

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,710
planning that's that's not how it works

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,690
out at all but there are a lot of other

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,460
tasks and that in that way fundraising

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,049
is also one where it's like oh don't you

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,629
just send people the email telling them

00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:38,679
it's time to send the money looking oh I

00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:40,179
wish I ourselves it's not that one um so

00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,679
million people kind of tell you how long

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,970
stuff is going to take and not being

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,710
like well you should be able to get that

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:49,450
done soon or it sounds sounds easy like

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,769
sending parameters like if you're if

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,110
you're having someone help you set up a

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:55,269
hackfest that would be like telling them

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,009
our budget for pizzas five hundred

00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:58,480
dollars so go ahead and I don't care

00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,000
what you put on the pizza but make sure

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,289
you don't spend 15 hundred or we always

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,759
try and do it somewhere near public

00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:05,889
transportation because we know people

00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,720
don't like to drive or whatever the

00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:09,340
parameters are and then then you don't

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,320
have to micro because you've given the

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,289
person the actual the parts that matter

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,640
like there should be pizza you should be

00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,410
able to get there on the subway

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,900
maybe that's not the case down here I

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,390
don't I guess you know how to survive

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,510
but uh and I'm making sure that everyone

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,550
is working towards the same goal when

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,010
people have to prioritize two or three

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,840
different tasks if they don't know what

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,120
the big goal is they're never going to

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,530
make the right prioritisation so if you

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,060
have someone working towards the same

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,740
goal that you're working for they know

00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,340
it's important to you then they know

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,930
it's important for them to get done this

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,450
is this is what happens when you show up

00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:49,780
with the wrong thing for the goal so you

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,490
know you don't want to do that my friend

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,980
Claire likes to say this teamwork makes

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,720
the dream work it sounds it sounds corny

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,070
but it's also like once you've heard it

00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,190
like you can't unhear it because it

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,920
rhymes so I don't know if you have that

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,260
kind of your one thing but it really

00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,120
does like it makes like when people feel

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,830
like there are you know part of the team

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,840
they're just happier like they want they

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,550
want to stay like they're not like five

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,110
o'clock i'm done if they feel like

00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,080
they're part of the team though they'll

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:22,260
say until the task is done if they feel

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,030
like you know that what they're doing

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,460
relates to the overall goal in a way

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:30,070
that they understand then then they know

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,900
like you can't get to that deadline if I

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,950
don't finish this today so you you

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,810
really want to make sure that people

00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,830
feel invested in part of the team

00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,590
because then they're going to give you

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,790
their best work which you know and see

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,070
when you once you say it you're like

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,870
yeah that does make sense it's so a lot

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,940
of his I say just so you know next time

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:49,180
you're like what would you know you can

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,220
think of whoever you're your mentor or

00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,990
model is like what would so and so do

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,620
and they would they would make the

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,620
teamwork choice

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:03,620
has anyone seen glengarry glen ross the

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,840
movie okay it's a it's a Camus V about

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,559
these guys that do sales and so they

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,320
their mantra is always be closing which

00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:14,330
is basically like always be selling it's

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,070
kind of like if you ever thought like a

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,910
sales job would be super fun you should

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:22,880
watch this movies it's really depressing

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,650
but but I want you to have a mantra and

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,179
this is more positive I promised the

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,299
result will be better than going Gary

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:30,950
Glen Ross always be including so if you

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:32,870
if you kind of if you get into a

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,400
situation where like she didn't cover

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,559
that I don't really know what to do like

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,110
kind of think to yourself would be what

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,409
would be the inclusive pass the

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,580
inclusive choice and so and I and I

00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,130
think that's going to be your best

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,419
choice you know unless you're given

00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,789
everyone cars and I don't know why

00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:53,809
you're giving over one cars but you you

00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:56,390
know it that's expensive will it's a

00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:59,080
reward people and give them like nice

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:01,850
titles has anyone here been an intern

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,570
did you did you put the word in turn on

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:08,270
your resume no I I never would either it

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,640
was like it doesn't it's like we

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,530
understood so little about what we what

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,450
you did for us this summer that we could

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,940
only come up with the title in turn to

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,140
describe it which is not like awesome

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,750
thing to put on your resume especially

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,700
if it's an unpaid internship like the

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,980
least you can let someone do is choose

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,210
like QA associate or something like that

00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:31,490
to put on the resume like or you know a

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,620
summer blogging resident whatever with

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,690
like so let people have a title it costs

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,760
you nothing to let people choose a

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:42,110
snazzy title that sounds better than

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,960
intern or they volunteer you know so

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:47,120
like vendor coordinator like oh did they

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,860
set up all the vendor tables for the for

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,890
the linux fest like awesome there the

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,600
vendor coordinator so so titles are

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,110
great record

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,810
is great media goblin every month or

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,970
every time we have a release we thank

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,350
everyone who contributed and we include

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,630
all the folks who did non-coding

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,220
activities right in there it cost has

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,200
nothing to do that but everyone feels

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,300
excited and they want to keep helping us

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,970
with translation and documentation and

00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,470
fundraising so it's just it costs us

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,170
nothing to thank them right alongside

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,390
everybody else but it makes a huge

00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,480
difference in the way that people feel

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:25,450
about contributing to your project we

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,280
talk about recognition and then um when

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,200
people are talking to you you want to be

00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,910
paying attention and taking notes just

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,730
you know you want to be checking in with

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:36,550
your volunteers like not micromanaging

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,470
like every single day but like oh hey

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,570
you've been been working on this for

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,510
like a week or so like how's it going

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,010
and then actually you know be listening

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,010
and taking notes and trying to figure

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,570
out how to make it better I think

00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,820
attention is one of those things that's

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,080
reciprocal like if you pay attention to

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,420
people who are contributing to your

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,550
project then they will pay attention to

00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,340
you no one likes to be like on the one

00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,780
sided part of that equation especially

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,440
if they're helping you as a volunteer

00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:07,630
like it's no good I asked to think that

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,850
the the listening can be sort of habit

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,440
forming like when you start as like an

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,390
exchange back and forth with someone

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,370
who's working on a certain aspect then

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,410
you get to figure out like which parts

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,300
each of you is interested in hearing

00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,300
about and so then you can like have a

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,160
higher efficiency sort of exchange where

00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,170
instead of it's like well on Monday I

00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,140
got coffee but then we're out so I had

00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,970
to go buy more filters and you know but

00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,560
like if you just cut to the chase and be

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,790
like if someone doesn't order more

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,800
coffee it's going to be a mess in here

00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,570
like okay great do it and then they'll

00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,370
tell you like oh so once the next

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,230
release date for our software like so I

00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,940
can get the blogging thing together like

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,280
okay it's going to be like June twenty

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,440
seven so then you have this short but

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,370
like high bandwidth communication that

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,770
is just better than like you know the

00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:58,640
glory

00:31:51,770 --> 00:32:01,160
um not listening superbad um I had a I

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,650
had a job number years ago where I was

00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,000
like here use this paradox database this

00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,740
is like a non-profit and they hadn't

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,220
updated this thing in like forever and

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,750
it was ms-dos based database and what

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,320
she did was you did a bunch data entry

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:17,210
and then and then as a batch like after

00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,430
you were done doing the day's data entry

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,130
you pushed that batch up like kind of as

00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,110
a patch to the database and what it was

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,930
doing it was like kind of like you can

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,420
almost hear it like like kind of timing

00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,910
out and then and then it would be like

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,860
up the patch didn't go up like you and

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:36,050
try again and I'm like yeah sure I just

00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,540
spent like an hour typing this menial

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,130
crap yes please try again so it would

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,720
try again and then I you know and

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,640
sometimes it would take like four or

00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,280
five times before I would go in and I

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,770
just I was like wow you know sorry I

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,950
told my boss in like the database it's

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,990
like it's really slow and like sometimes

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,630
you have to push the you know the days

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,670
back up like five times it just doesn't

00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:03,920
seem right music uh sure I'm sure it's

00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:06,650
fine turnout we were basing our

00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,110
financials off this database and what

00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,300
was happening on those five pushes of

00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,610
the patch was it was pushing somewhere

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,540
between like 10 and ninety percent of

00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:20,300
the data up over and over and over again

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,250
so we had like sometimes five or 12

00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,600
versions of the same record so like

00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,310
someone would send us a fifty-dollar

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:31,090
check I was sending over to the

00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:33,920
financials like 1,200 bucks whoo so um

00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,510
did not listen cuz i eventually thought

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,820
i was like i guess i'm just complaining

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:41,420
about the cranky old database so i'll

00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,800
stop talking about it and like oh you

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,270
want to see things come out of the

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,490
woodwork when you're like twelve

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,360
thousand dollars off on your financials

00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,710
don't do that

00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,320
so you do not want to be known for not

00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,940
listening that is a bad bad bad place to

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,289
be you're going to be the last person in

00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:01,539
the building as it burns around you and

00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,789
then also everyone is expert at

00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,320
something we talked about like letting

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,200
people set the timeframe for their own

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,669
thing but also like if if someone is

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,980
doing something I like I don't know why

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:14,379
you would do it that way like ask as

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,690
opposed to grasp like the way you would

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,800
do it on there you know that's again

00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,210
that's one of those things that's like

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,310
once you're at out loud you're like oh

00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,560
yeah I without some that soundtrack

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:27,070
flueless if I did that but what it

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,960
happens um you know if you if you don't

00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,129
respect people's expertise then you're

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,429
going to get your do you know what

00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:38,139
handed to you so um you don't want that

00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:39,790
uh this one I don't know like two people

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,790
are aware of like kind of general idea

00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:46,030
of a pedestal right there was a story in

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:50,560
monavie culture probably owe me a couple

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:53,710
months ago now but um it's a woman who

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,050
was working with a bunch of coders 12

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:59,890
like young men it is super exciting

00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:01,480
startup and um and they felt like oh

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,700
they're like the most important people

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,440
in the building because this woman

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,390
usually gets lunch for them and stuff

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,450
and she had to go to a funding meeting

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,560
in the middle of that like one day and

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,510
like all of these kind of lengths

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,000
startups they have like a ton of snacks

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,430
in the kitchen and so like lunch rolls

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,340
around and they're like Lisa didn't get

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,619
us lunch today and so they went into the

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,420
kitchen and like the only snack that

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,270
there was a lot of was this like giant

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,490
case of beef jerky so they just plowed

00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:33,100
through the whole box of beef jerky and

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:36,490
she came in and she's like oh I don't

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,860
what oh my god guys like how do you not

00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,130
know

00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,350
order your lunch so the pedestal is bad

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,300
for everyone like for one like they're

00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,250
just like why do you not act like our

00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,920
mommy all the time which is creepy and

00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,620
bizarre on a dome right but then like

00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,300
it's kind of like do you can you see

00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,510
yourself like you just ate like two

00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,970
pounds of beef jerky for lunch because

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,070
you couldn't figure out how to get the

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,050
internet the thing that makes money for

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,510
you to bring lunch to you I don't

00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,490
understand either so you know to the

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,960
pedestal is kind of a weird thing like

00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,540
you know people should do their own

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,510
laundry and and know how to order

00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,460
takeout on their own and stuff and it

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:20,180
just creates a really weird artificial

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:22,040
dynamic also I can't even every time I

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,870
call it sorry I imagine what the smell

00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,640
of 12 people that have just eaten beef

00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,820
jerky and nothing else for lunches and

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,590
I'm like good all right move on um so

00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,350
donor in the pedestal because of sadness

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,540
although I'm you know opposed to

00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:38,270
unnecessary sadness but because there

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,610
are there fishes in the sea and by 50

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:43,970
sometimes I mean goblins like if you if

00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:46,100
you treat your non coders crummy and

00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,110
then we'll take them over at media

00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,000
goblin or some other project well kinome

00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:52,790
well you know any number of other

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,540
projects that is doing stuff and is

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:59,150
excited and thanks here uh all right up

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,650
there um that thinks they're you know

00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,330
that thanks to our translators and

00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,040
thanks their fundraisers and thanks

00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,900
their event planners and thanks for

00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,390
people who sweat all day and the mascot

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,510
all of those things we will take them

00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:14,540
over at our project or another project

00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:17,870
so just to recap and I think we're doing

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,820
okay on time um everyone's an expert at

00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,730
something let them be that expert in

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,570
their area saves you time it saves them

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:31,100
irritation listening this is the other

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:33,370
obligatory cat listening is good you do

00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,510
not want to be known for not doing it

00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:37,460
bonus points for finding out what

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,220
motivates people to work on your project

00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,260
because then

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,119
no then you'll know if they're getting

00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,250
what what they were hoping to get out of

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,109
it I had someone asked me once it was a

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,240
slightly different type of topic and

00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,920
he's like why do people leave your

00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,940
project and it looks like a little bit

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,680
sad so as I was like well you know did

00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,500
you did you talk to them and they're

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,570
like nope and I'm like so that might be

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,790
part 1 and then part two is the only

00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,859
person who knows why that person was at

00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,109
your project in the first place is that

00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:11,740
person so the only way to find out why

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:13,630
they left is to talk with them so so if

00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,890
you know what is motivating people you

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,270
know they're looking to put something on

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:19,030
their resume or they want to put a

00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,680
website in their portfolio then you know

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,540
then you know how to give them what they

00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,840
want so that they can do a bunch of free

00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:29,109
work for you right so don't treat people

00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:33,490
like monkeys also maybe lock up the big

00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:35,050
turkey or they will leave fix your

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,280
credit I'm going to take some questions

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:42,490
next minute here just to remind you the

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,230
monochromatic lot worse for a while is

00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,060
this not as good as having all the

00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,270
plants we're gonna I want you guys to

00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,160
help me build like a big diverse

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,830
multi-perspective ille free software

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,930
movement radishes and beats lettuce and

00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,930
all those things so thanks very much

00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:13,430
do people have questions yeah we'll take

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:17,270
you at media Goblin but yeah tons of

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:19,580
them so the do you want to are you

00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:22,840
offering your services what do you what

00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,840
do you want to do what do you like doing

00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:34,400
yeah yeah so um we'd love to have you a

00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,950
media Goblin I know they're looking for

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,630
folks to do that at LibreOffice I know

00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,230
granola is always interested in having

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:48,530
people do that yo your what's your and

00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:51,530
the Ono wikimedia foundation yeah so yet

00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,030
you're you're a very hot commodity

00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,599
everyone wants you to come work for them

00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:59,260
awesome cool oh did you want to put your

00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,260
two cents in

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,040
so yeah then project Wikimedia

00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,360
Foundation apparently do you have

00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,360
another project or another question

00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,550
mm-hmm

00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,260
mm-hmm

00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:44,990
right so that's a yes so is there a

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,510
clearinghouse for non-coding volunteers

00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:51,750
in theory we we would be willing to host

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:55,380
that at a open hatch which is a

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:57,420
nonprofit that works on helping new

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,329
folks find a free software project to

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,800
contribute to but in practice most

00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:05,609
products don't send us that money

00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,530
non-coding tickets unfortunately so for

00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,569
non coders are currently looking for

00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,609
something I would look at the projects

00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:15,180
that have participated in the genome

00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:17,640
outreach program because they have done

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,800
that first step of figuring out and then

00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,339
articulating what types of non-coding

00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,440
tasks they confuse so that that's where

00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:27,300
I would start today but I would advocate

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,210
if you're on the other end and your

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:33,630
project is not like constantly blogging

00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:36,480
you should be blogging anyway but every

00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,190
time we every time we've loved a new

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,450
release at media goblin like I said we

00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:42,000
thank all the people who are doing the

00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,740
non-coding task and then most of the

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,990
times when we blog any other kind of

00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,119
news we remind people like if you want

00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,309
to get involved as a coat or a document

00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,460
or a translator you know blah blah blah

00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:56,099
blah like please come and see this on

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,500
email or IRC you know so we give them

00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:02,069
both options if because not all the non

00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,280
coders hang out on our sand called it so

00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:06,750
that's that's like a little homework for

00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,059
for the folks who have code projects in

00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,220
the room I guess other questions

00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:17,840
comments

00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:17,840
ideas pitches d

00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:31,470
yeah oh look a backup and feature design

00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,460
seems like

00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,460
asking for

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:42,910
it's certainly still

00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:47,000
yeah yeah I know you're like seven years

00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:50,810
yeah love petitions if you're doing like

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,930
kind of advocacy of Exile work um you

00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:56,570
know answering questions for like

00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,030
support anything any of those if you

00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,920
think your project could use more of it

00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:06,440
then the first step is to articulate it

00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:11,780
and put it on your website is the

00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:14,990
feature feature oh yeah user user

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,640
feedback is fantastic we didn't have it

00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,100
in Boston called spinach Khan where we

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,720
had people come it was like what if your

00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,420
favorite free software project has a

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,450
little spinach in its teeth so invited

forums which like has pretty high

00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,960
burnout factor depending on your list or

00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,170
forum is a great place to use non coders

00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,340
so there's there's tons and tons to do

00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,340
so anything else

00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:08,430
I have a have one another one of the

00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:12,480
things I do as a non coder in addition

00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:17,549
to chatting with folks about patent is a

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:20,250
0 is I help with a conference in Seattle

00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:25,230
too so so consider the time I'll plug

00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:27,569
that as well so okay anything else

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:31,160
everyone's ready to go get non coders in

00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:31,160
their project yeah

00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,290
rarely seen

00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,170
put together a lot teacher

00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:56,550
no all these sorts of things most

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,960
creative talents

00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,310
and it's like please come

00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,570
got good code but make us look good so

00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:18,150
that someone actually says hey what is

00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:19,390
that use your words yeah it's that's one

00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,590
bridge that I

00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:26,640
rarely see and most of the time

00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:28,420
somebody's somebody girlfriends

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,030
brother-in-law

00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,850
does that later on them in david logo

00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,240
no no but I don't see the sort of

00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,240
dynamic

00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:40,119
graphics

00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,390
yeah and I think it's really good like

00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,240
and I'd love to see stuff marketed a

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:52,720
little bit like or like you know kind of

00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,160
tested like I don't mean to pick on

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,920
Gloucester because it's a it's a great

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,570
product but their their logo is kind of

00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,820
funny it looks like a bug eating the

00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:02,500
code because it's like a bug eating a

00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:05,560
leaf with the zeros or ones on it and

00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:08,290
and and I said that to john mark i think

00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,150
last year and i was like what is cluster

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:14,950
do it looks like a bug eating your code

00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:17,740
and he's like uh I never thought of it

00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:20,080
like that and like huh yeah that's a

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,270
funny one then but I mean it's meant to

00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,740
be like everywhere like like ants

00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,080
everyone is bringing a little piece

00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,940
together I was like okay i guess i can

00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,520
see the metaphor flips the other way

00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,070
it's it's it's carrying the code not

00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,350
meaning it but the ants carry with their

00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:41,190
mouths in in real life and then also in

00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:41,190
the gloucester logo hmm

00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,589
happy

00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,589
and

00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,110
Oh

00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:21,390
well in sometimes you can ask a project

00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:24,630
or like I really loved your t-shirts who

00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:28,170
did the design you might be able to with

00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:30,779
beer or cash like coax that person to

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,849
design a t-shirt or two for you in this

00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:37,019
case it's a one of the organizing

00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:40,319
committees guys his dad does graphic

00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:44,579
design and so he he did the seagull for

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:49,109
us so so graphic design yeah writing

00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:50,880
blogging is also like Chris and I media

00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:52,289
Gamla and like he'll he'll write like

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,440
all of the things that are in the new

00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:57,680
release as like a sort of a few of words

00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,140
and then I will make them into sentences

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,579
so and he's aware of that I mean like I

00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,440
mean I don't think he would ever publish

00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:08,309
this view but he knows that I'll make it

00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,160
into a good sentence so okay well cool

00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:13,289
if those aren't have anything else um

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,969
you know feel free maybe you have like a

00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:17,779
question you don't ask me from the group

00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:23,119
you can shoot me an email otherwise

00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:23,119
before find non coders awesome thank you

00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,729
your customers rely on your website or

00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:35,099
application if it's slower

00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:38,009
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:39,869
and costs you money keeping your

00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:43,360
business critical systems humming along

00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:46,210
requires insight into what they're doing

00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,190
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:50,440
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:52,750
resource limitations and other problems

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,520
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,130
your systems performance metrics in

00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,980
real-time and record this data for later

00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,960
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,970
see what's really going on under the

00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,100
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,110
visualize the status of all your systems

00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,020
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:13,960
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:16,420
memory swap processes load and network

00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,000
usage click a specific system to access

00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,980
its individual dashboard then click and

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,980
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,990
more detail comprehensive network data

00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,690
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:30,280
is available on the network tab and disk

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,170
rights and free space on the disk

00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,020
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,570
displays usage statistics for individual

00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,730
processes the system info tab shows

00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,980
listening services active connections

00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:44,110
and available updates adding long view

00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,790
to a system is easy just click the

00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,950
button copy the one line installation

00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:50,380
command then run the command on your

00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,090
linux system to complete the process the

00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,280
agent will begin collecting data and

00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,110
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,690
start rolling

00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:01,060
use longview to gain visibility into

00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:04,800
your servers so when your website or app

00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,800
