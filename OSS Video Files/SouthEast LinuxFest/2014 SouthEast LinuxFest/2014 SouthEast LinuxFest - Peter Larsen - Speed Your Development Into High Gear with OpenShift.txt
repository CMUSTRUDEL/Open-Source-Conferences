the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,769
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,330
in 2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:30,359
possible okay thank you actually you

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,719
expected a about half turn out today so

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,710
I think I'm pretty much in targets this

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,079
is what happens when you were on the

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,730
last day and when you don't crest

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,450
earlier in the week but I was pretty

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,550
flexible this weekend so I prefer to a

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,910
sort of do it whenever we can get around

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,770
to it so I'm probably going to turn

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,420
things around a little bit and a lot of

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,010
a lot of the talks that I've been to has

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,710
been very much focused in the system

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,390
administration side on infrastructure so

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,020
before I really get started how many in

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,609
here are developers very good so that

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,739
was the whole point a wandering instead

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,990
of talking about how does this all work

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,840
with it from a operations perspective

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,189
how does this help you as a developer

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,790
before I really get started I guess I

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,500
need to go to this just it does the Red

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,420
Hat I try to tone it down a little bit

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,939
for today's talk but I do work for a hat

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,040
my job has been in the IT industry has

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,869
been quite extensive all kinds of

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,840
different types types of topics i

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,750
started out as a consultant grew into

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,090
all kinds of different roles primarily

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,400
initially but commercial software as the

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,680
preferred a professional side use

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,259
open-source freeware PBS's and that

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,229
whole shebang when I was off client side

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,560
so I've always been into open source and

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:52,350
being able to distribute code but but

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,180
paid the check paired my paycheck for a

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,259
long time was commercial or commercial I

00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,180
software and as a cyst down here I'm

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,930
paid to go around talking about

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,869
technology that's really my in my job

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,119
description my job is to try to explain

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,210
to people that don't necessarily become

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,490
comes from a technology background

00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:19,960
why this technology can help them or how

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:23,000
it can help them so before i get into

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,320
sort of what i want to sue from from

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,020
this crowd here what are some of the

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,730
challenges you have when it comes to hey

00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,410
i need to do development what is it it

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:38,270
takes the most time what frustrates you

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:40,460
the most yep meetings yep in the actual

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,080
process of development is there what

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:48,280
what kind of tasks are you doing that

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:51,890
the most time consuming so let's say

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,930
that one of the web application can I

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,850
just start coding that or what is it

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,880
what do I need to have before I can

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,350
start coding my web application you need

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,560
to have some place to put the code and

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,940
test it and then sometimes I need to

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,740
convince someone else that I need those

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,750
libraries versus those libraries and we

00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,020
have the usual fight about what's the

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,050
best solution for everyone right I tend

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:18,860
to find the meetings all about that

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:22,070
right really my time spent when I was a

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,840
developer was to figure out what do my

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,380
love my customer my colleagues need the

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,020
app to do not necessarily me coding it

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,150
or even worse telling me me telling them

00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,430
how the app had to be coded not in their

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,960
way but in the agreed-upon way and

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,960
that's not really different from an open

00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,640
source project when we collaborate we

00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
got to have some common rules otherwise

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,100
no one can figure out what's going on

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,220
but we all have to come to agreement

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,020
hence we have our spam list I mean we

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,570
have our flame walls and our mailing

00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,390
list and so on right so I try to come up

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,880
with an idea what that usually happens

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,220
when a developer wants to go first we

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,220
start with a great idea you know that

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,480
could come from the boss that says we

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,400
need to do this to make a lot of money

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,170
so this is the new app go go make it

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,030
happen or it could have been you saying

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,210
if we did this differently if we just

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,650
did that we could change the world why a

00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,410
lot of open source projects that's out

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,940
you know the whole idea is everyone else

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,410
is doing the wrong way I have a better

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,190
way of doing that so we start with a

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,800
good idea that's usually the fun part

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:28,220
the next part is getting people involved

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,569
a lot of times on your at work you need

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,520
an approval based on these would be some

00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,190
funding behind you so you can get access

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,830
to the equipment and so on oh if you're

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,389
new open south side where can I run this

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,740
stuff do i need to you know set

00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,479
something up on a web server somewhere

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,819
in the clouds do i need to spend money

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:47,330
on that or can i convince my fedora

00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,830
project manager ambassador to let me

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,539
borrow their server for a while I mean

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,789
how do I get access to that or do you

00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:54,259
just get hop and all the other but get

00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:58,550
up just this my source code I need to

00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,409
run it right so this may be optional you

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,180
may already have at home a system with

00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:04,310
an OS that you're using but every

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,889
development project comes with a ton of

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,590
dependencies so one of the things i

00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,150
always find a troubling when i do any

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,409
kind of development is if i start you

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,090
use the same OS for everything

00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:15,860
everything gets messed up very quickly I

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,270
don't know what's there I don't know

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,710
what versions they have but that could

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,909
be conflicts between two or three

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,879
different projects on morning at the

00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,259
same time so i end up with different VMs

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,240
maybe i can run in my mouth maybe I have

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,949
enough hardware to run a lot about that

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,719
at home but I still need to set up the

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,819
OSI still need to know how to do that

00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:35,630
need to set up networks I have all these

00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:38,240
different things that in my developer

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:41,990
had those are really not things that I

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,940
was hired to do then it comes the world

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,120
okay now I need to put my server on them

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,900
and I Apache my PHP my passenger for you

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,659
Ruby I need to do all these other stuff

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,000
just to run my code okay i think google

00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,379
it and someone set it up to give us some

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,870
initial up but then I find out later

00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:02,840
that I did a you know my co won't work

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,610
because it wasn't set up right oh maybe

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,349
I'm making a lot more coat and I was

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,789
supposed to because hey there was

00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,740
already out there I was just not aware

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,469
of it so knowing the frameworks knowing

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,300
how they're configured is important

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,340
doing that you know in an enterprise

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,750
situation a job well now all of a sudden

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,340
you have a whole team of people around

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,830
you this says well you can't do it that

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,590
way we have standards with security

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,840
groups we have operating operators that

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,069
says well we can only maintain it within

00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,479
these r elements so lots of meetings and

00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,680
hashing that out and being frustrated

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,479
that you can't do it the easy way

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,390
because you did insist on doing the

00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,600
hardware using old tools

00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:44,450
and I'm going to add some more stuff but

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,430
some databases if I want to do something

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,380
that is a little more out of the hey I

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,210
just have a single app for for testing

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,150
or need to load balancer figure out how

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,290
do I code for failover you know if I

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,000
need to have a session with a shopping

00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,470
cart you know how do I make sure that

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,270
doesn't go away and you code for that I

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,570
need to have the infrastructure there to

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,790
do that you just set it all up again not

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,910
development right I want to code I want

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:11,690
to make my cool app once I have all that

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:13,580
in place I can start doing that now as I

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,130
said I'm paid to talk to customer been

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,260
to 80 customers in general people are

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,530
interested in figuring out how to solve

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:25,040
the problem better I have customers

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:30,800
where that process takes them almost two

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,480
years literally from the time someone

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,280
says this needs to be done to the

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,990
equipment and everything set up and

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,850
being actually start the project when I

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,350
talk to them about what openshift does

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,230
in a couple of seconds they look at me

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,340
like I'm crazy if they would get it down

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,300
to a week they will think there was a

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:53,090
miracle that's the problem we're trying

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,670
to solve this is what this weird word

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,620
called pass is all about

00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,950
platform-as-a-service the whole idea

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,840
that you don't do get a service that

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,870
gives you all of these things that just

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,030
talk about outbox and you can now

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,010
concentrate and doing what you're much

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,190
better at and maybe much more interested

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,660
in is to get the code running and not

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,190
have to fight with all these guys about

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,660
you know how do we need to set up what

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,130
frameworks do we need to come south box

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:24,440
it's already set up for it so after

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,080
you've got things gone I mean you got

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,110
your machine I had it there was a good

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,090
talk on Friday to discuss some of the

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,180
bad things we do for when we build and

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:38,570
home control stuff and I really it got

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:42,080
me thinking that yep I recognize that

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,700
scenario a lot how do I actually create

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,110
and build my project consistently

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,960
because one thing is in my development

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,520
system that it works great once I get it

00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,340
deployed somewhere or someone else tries

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,620
to deploy it that's when I get all the

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,480
this doesn't work kind of our ideas why

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,730
I could of course design the wrong a

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,410
front I could have done put huh cody

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,970
urls and all kinds of our stuff in my

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:07,100
code that practicing no matter what i do

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,770
but in general i needed to find a way to

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,650
consistently build myself where for

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,910
deployment so it can be done so i need

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,100
to document it right i need to use the

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,200
right methodologies and i need to

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,060
understand that this may be deployed on

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,060
a different server that i didn't control

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,500
you also need a place to put your

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,660
software a lot of us at least I'm you

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,520
know looking at it as a good option if

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,320
you are working for company that might

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,960
be an internal repository somewhere you

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,330
have to deal with getting access to that

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,050
to create a new project can also be a

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:45,260
lengthy process or even getting commit

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,210
access or similar right access to

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:53,560
existing trees you know usually take

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:55,820
some time and another example would be

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,790
okay in order for me to really prove my

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,610
code works I got to build something into

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,870
it to validate my coat so if you look at

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,240
it for instance a lot of open source

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,010
biltz that are done like for fedora and

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,080
package building there's these processes

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,240
running every night for building they

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,740
gives you this long report about the

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,780
state of the code how can they do that

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,910
well they're firing on all these test

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,830
scenarios that says test this operation

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,330
tasty separation and that status report

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,700
comes back so if someone checks into

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,800
some piece of bad code it may have fixed

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,390
the problem in network team but it had a

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,210
side effect into something else and by

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,950
firing all the test scenarios you get a

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,890
nice report about whether that project

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,720
act is a stable build or not but you've

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,000
got to develop those they need to be

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,140
part of it a lot of times those are the

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,060
delivery test if you are in an

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,160
enterprise disabled you code has to do

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,720
this and this is how you prove that it

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,310
works and of course they make sure you

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
deployments are predictable so when you

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,000
develop something and you deliver that

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,830
you said well I did I developed it to

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,230
working that in Wyman you described and

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,710
I can actually guarantee that it does

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,000
that and that's a lot more than that so

00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,000
how many here have heard of the word

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
DevOps I mean here tire hearing about it

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:14,820
the what DevOps is in this sense is the

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,380
ID idea that is it available not in I'm

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,020
not in a bubble we be all going to

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,340
realize that you know I why we think I

00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,780
have the most important job because the

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,870
software that everyone depends on comes

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,370
out of my my fingers it still needs to

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,550
run and I'm not the one who's the

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,290
operational person that keeps it running

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,820
you know once i'm done with my delivery

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,040
hopefully i have another project to work

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,560
on i'm not here this is the magnet or

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,530
anything like that so we normally look

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,480
at a process that says well we have a

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,040
need it's this business neat i'm sorry

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,710
this might be a little bit too marketing

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,260
but you know you're fulfilling some kind

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,990
of idea that says well problem you're

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,090
solving some kind of issue and once you

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,380
that leads you to development and then

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,890
lead you to the to operation those

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,470
different people different interests

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,930
that i'll play and you need to sort of

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,330
collaborate and to meet DevOps is all a

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,910
matter of getting that collaboration

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,280
working so from an aberration

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,360
perspective when i talked to two i'm at

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,740
the atmos out there and they are very

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,990
much you know particularly the

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,460
government security you know are you

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,230
fulfilling all the government standards

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,620
and you fulfill these protocols can you

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,060
do ipv6 all that stuff can we can we

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,980
make sure it's complying with our

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,960
internal standards they have a long

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:33,180
laundry list of things that has to be

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:36,000
there we also of course have again is

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,750
this business but consider that as your

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,670
requirement well who needs that when do

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,020
they need it I mean if I take 18 months

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,700
you just get started developed by the

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,080
time I'd done my development and I'm

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:51,470
done production was moved on right when

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,060
we look at a company's like Twitter of

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,660
even Facebook they do daily to plumb

00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,720
multiple deployments to production a day

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,070
they don't have this long cycle to do

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,600
that and the reason they can do is

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,270
because to control the process just like

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,250
an open source project does so they can

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,710
do test automated they can have all

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,030
these automated process going on but you

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,560
have a demand you have a set of

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,910
requirements that this solution has to

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,620
be there by a certain time line

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,570
sometimes that's your boss telling you

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,950
sometimes that's what you're saying

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,840
in order for me to help someone else

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,370
with a problem I need to have this out

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,900
to them sooner than later and that's why

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,870
we saw the heck during the night nor the

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,480
weekend and say here on Monday go go for

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,780
it right I made something cool sometimes

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,410
that works and of course on the

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,150
development we want to not have to spend

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,800
our time and stuff we don't need to we

00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,440
want to use some new features some new

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,150
flashy stuff a lot of times ago well if

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,740
I coated it with these libraries like in

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,030
ojs I didn't have to do all these other

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,800
stuff and my app actually looks pretty

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,010
cool and all the devices so I want to

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,840
use that library not my old stuff that

00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:00,780
I've been using with my static websites

00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,790
right I want to be able to you know make

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,350
my life easier I want to be able to test

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,180
off easier and this is why some people

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,890
love IDEs and other people hate them

00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,990
because there's so many much stuff in

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,340
there but this is part of what a good

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,910
development environment provides all

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,980
these things go together data step-ups

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:20,400
once all these guys work around the same

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,200
goal test setup and that's what we're

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,880
trying to do a bit open shift when I say

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,950
we that I will get into a little bit of

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,610
history what that means right hat in

00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:32,520
this sense so all of this is based on a

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,910
concept called containers this is a

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,830
little bit on the system admin side but

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:42,780
what containers allows us to do is to

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:45,420
create an own template of system

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:48,030
resources it could be a server setup it

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,830
could be security setup and we can

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:53,310
maintain them individually from the

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,810
application and to us as i'm going to do

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,840
development that's just your template

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,670
this is our system that we get and it

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,910
means that we can instantiate that

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:05,400
template little in seconds and you have

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,550
a full functioning completely set up and

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,390
ready to use server have you heard of

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:15,120
the word the project called darker or

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,950
project atomic that's literally what

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,530
happens when you instantiate the dark

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,930
instance today now open shift doesn't do

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,990
it with daca yet that's coming that is

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,190
absolutely on the agenda but it does

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,140
with some other technologies and

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,970
achieves the same idea just in a

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,680
different way and some people call it a

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:36,620
harder way but that's for the operators

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:40,680
we're about not you so we maintain a

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,060
template and that's the only so if we

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,980
want to do an update to say hey these

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,450
libraries needs to be updated all I need

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,570
to set up a new database connector that

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:50,310
is standard for all my projects that's a

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,990
simple update and anything that uses

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,310
that template can be updated in seconds

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,320
that's the cool thing you no longer

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,180
involved you know someone change the

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,270
password database change the template

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:07,550
done you don't have the password in your

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:09,690
code anywhere you're not supposed to

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,230
they are a lot easier to deal with

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,470
interview why because the vm requires

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,100
you to take ownership with the whole OS

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,959
this is the difference between

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,910
infrastructure and platform as a service

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,649
so by using platform you get all these

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,110
other components on top of the OS given

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:30,180
to you if you go directly to the vm sure

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,310
install your own vm you know and you own

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,560
OS on all the components it's cool is

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:41,580
flexible but takes a lot of time and the

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:45,300
security of containers is and this is my

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:48,270
statement here my feeling on it they at

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,529
least as secure if not better than a vm

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:53,940
a lot it when I when I look at vm

00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,650
security they all depend on what the

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,390
hypervisor no one has access to well

00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,440
once you compromise the hypervisor on a

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:03,480
be on an e XX I box I could pretty wide

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,250
access to anything and it doesn't stop

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,439
me one of the things that kvm built into

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,809
it is that it even has these segments on

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,490
the OS the OS can't even wipe between

00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,689
them so if you compromise one vm you

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,929
don't get access to another but still

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,339
the containers maintain this atomic or

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,980
they split between the different

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,750
deployments for you and there is no

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,090
access from one container to another if

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,040
you compromise one that's it even though

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,690
it ones as a process on the box it

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,630
doesn't have access to any underlying

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,890
services lightweight so I don't know how

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,740
would the size of your laptops of

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,570
workstations on general my guess is at

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,850
least eight gig someone ram

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:52,500
how many VMS can you run with eight gigs

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:57,419
of ram and are you guys running VMS

00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:01,950
today to do development one or two if I

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:06,169
told you that with the same size of box

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,169
I can easily run about 20 containers

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,860
with that interest you right so with

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,700
less resources I have more flexibility

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,340
it's pretty cool this is why I'm a big

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,799
fan of darker as a whole to see where

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,350
that takes us because it the promise of

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,730
not only easy management but I can take

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:31,019
my older hardware and want a lot more

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,240
stuff on it I love it so this is my only

00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,570
architectural slide I promise I won't

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,889
really go into two depths of this I

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,480
didn't say from the get-go please do

00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:41,009
interrupt me if you have questions but I

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,070
want to show a little bit of what's open

00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:47,429
shift is all about so behind the scene

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,769
this is a condensed version of

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:54,299
everything we have so underneath

00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:56,399
everything Israel and it doesn't care

00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,200
where it once ya can run it in a vm

00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:00,620
against their containers they're not vm

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,889
some running containers inside a vm

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,750
having fun i can run on bare metal so

00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:09,840
set up my machine no i can run in the

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:12,690
cloud it as long as it runs real or send

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,940
us or something else like that now i'm

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:19,320
pretty sure debian might have some

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:23,279
packages today on your original site but

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,370
the default installer will automatically

00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,379
do young commands and so on you can tell

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,870
that hey the repository is already there

00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:32,429
just start installing and that work

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,139
would have been too so if you know

00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:38,220
exactly what we posed to point to you

00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:39,840
don't have a problem so we have two

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,940
types of machines they can actually

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,850
exist it's the same note my demo is all

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,470
one machine so we have one something

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,019
called a broker it's basically the

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,179
administrator that's the guide and

00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,269
manages the installation he's the guy or

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,590
it's the guy person that has the

00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:57,419
database of all the infrastructure knows

00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,399
where everything is tells everyone what

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:04,080
to do doesn't do any of

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:07,409
job he's a true manager what the node is

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,789
what contains all our containers in

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:14,879
openshift we call them gears so when i

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:18,719
create a application it basically a

00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:23,609
replies conceptually a gear a gear is

00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:25,019
implemented using a couple of very some

00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,989
people hate it's a linux some people

00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,879
love it i find that most people that

00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:32,249
hate is a linux has not really wanted to

00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:34,019
learn about it so every time it tells

00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:35,549
you that ADA is a security problem the

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,769
solution is to disable it right don't

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:41,849
disable a cell and learn about it it

00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:44,039
will save your buck so the gear is

00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,989
actually primarily secured with Linux

00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,179
that means that when I go on and

00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:51,109
actually lock on to that gear with ssh I

00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:54,450
can't see anything but my own stuff I

00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,729
have no access to other people's files I

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,399
have no access or anyone else but when I

00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:02,549
do PS would show me all processes I only

00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:06,269
see my own even though I may be one out

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:07,559
of 20 others on that box I can't see any

00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,269
of that process I can't see all the

00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,859
colonel processes I can see anything but

00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:16,499
my own stuff there's also see groups

00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:19,379
involved to manage resources so i can

00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:20,700
slit my machine up in small parts so

00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,820
something doesn't take all the resources

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,969
and in a few all kinds of like

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,799
namespaces to ensure that files are not

00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:31,320
shared when they're not supposed to be

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,789
and so on once again is created what

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,169
goes into it is basic your code

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:41,429
repository and yes that the fun part of

00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:44,279
it the recipes the templates of open

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:46,169
chef for call cartridges so a year can

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,989
only be instantiated based on a

00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,369
cartridge so basically that tells it ok

00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:52,710
container this is what you need to look

00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:54,899
like and that comes from the cartridge

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,749
that is an old inspect so setting up a

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:59,399
new cartridge creating your own is

00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:03,479
pretty simple in a min to the spec file

00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:04,729
and you set it up and deploy it and you

00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:08,940
set up your own way of doing things

00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:11,549
pretty easy within that cartridge you

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,950
may also add sub cartridges and these

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,710
did not show up right but

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,169
so you can say okay I want to run a PHP

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,919
application i also want to associate a

00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:25,289
database that's just another it isn't

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,320
call it a Don cartridge not sure why

00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:30,000
that word is better than anything else

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,320
but me not gonna use my sequel for any

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,909
kind of language you're dizzy so it's

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,460
the same kind of recipe same kind of

00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:39,240
template regardless of what language I'm

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,059
use it but my PHP katras has special

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,510
rules of how do i access it because

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:49,770
that's different than my Ruby my pearl

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:52,260
my job you can also add dependencies

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,299
like say on Jenkins and other features

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,890
that controls you built so now you have

00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,049
a full complete build environment for

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,600
continuous integration know how many

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:02,130
hears from the libertines concern since

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,260
your developers I'm assuming that's not

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:09,090
a foreign word okay so we add a lot of

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,039
additional features so it still has the

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,260
lock files and as I said you can assist

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,179
SSH into it you can run cron jobs in

00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,539
there it's a complete box from your

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:22,740
perspective but it runs as an isolated

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,840
environment you as a developer will use

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,720
a rest interface to access it there's a

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,299
command line version as a web browser

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,010
version and you can use there's a plugin

00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:34,140
for Eclipse I think it's there for

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,659
netbeans two and a couple of others have

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,220
made plugins to it it's a fairly simple

00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,580
rest interface to implement so it's

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,500
actually fairly easy to do so you can

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,179
pick if you like command line you don't

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,279
have to leave it don't need to go to an

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,559
ID to do any of this stuff if you like a

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,770
web interface it's a nice web interface

00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,080
and if you really insist you can quote

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,700
your own API on top of the rest and make

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,279
your own apt attacks esas it doesn't

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,370
matter but all that does allows you to

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,380
say you know I want to create a gear the

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,630
lead one I want to promote it do

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,029
something else with it but it just

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,429
defines saying this is what I want to

00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:14,970
work on when you actually have code to

00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:17,490
do all you do is use get you already

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,010
using probably get of something very

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,289
close to the source control I can

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:25,320
imagine any of you as a developer not

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:26,310
using a source control already it may

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,840
not be your most

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,020
to think you may not check in very often

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,250
nor you if you don't but it's there

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:38,850
because it's a requirement right well we

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:41,930
use that mechanism to deploy code so the

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:45,990
moment you check in to get it's deployed

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,300
and running done so all I have to do is

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,240
follow my standard routine for for for

00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,970
deployment I mean for coding don't have

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,320
to invent the new world a world of hey I

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,820
have to go in there have a cover the

00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,810
files I have to run this command blah

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,400
blah blah it's done for you and then

00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:08,730
once you've done that the website

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,560
response and I'll show that in demo so

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,300
there are three different versions of

00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,760
open shift what I'm going to show to you

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,960
is the community version the cool

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,300
version because that's where all the new

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,710
stuff is there is an online version and

00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,580
the fun thing is that actually came

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,410
before Richard so long story short or it

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,140
started as more less as an experiment

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,550
from red hat saying is that really

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,470
interesting that someone had come up

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:38,340
with this concept so we have to deploy

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,890
it open shift in the cloud on AWS two

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,080
and a half years ago and said come on

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,780
come all tell us how this works tell us

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,430
what we need to improve add extension to

00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,750
it you know it was no market sector so

00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:52,050
you can add your own cartridges and so

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:57,000
on and well let's say just been a

00:25:52,050 --> 00:26:00,450
stunning success today we have in the

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,950
neighborhood and 1.5 or more million

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,430
apps running out there that we're

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,110
hosting for free anyone can go and sign

00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,660
up for an account we get up to three

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,550
gears for a free account if you are

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,100
working on open source projects you just

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:17,910
email / shift at redhat.com and request

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,020
more resources if you are commercial

00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,700
entity you can buy additional resources

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,190
so there's a free hosting service right

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,110
here to do your PHP to do pretty much

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,110
any kind of coding that you can imagine

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:35,410
of course there's a supported version

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,210
called an open shift in the price this

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,620
is the one that is always way behind

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:44,410
everything else but it's also the one

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:47,320
that's been tested the most so we use

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,940
the standard part of it is you know all

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,740
the cool stuff all the fun stuff all the

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,260
experimentation happens is the region

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:56,890
and that of a trickles down it's online

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,050
first and then we because there's so

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,090
many users on that and keeping the tires

00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,590
on something new with that many users we

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,320
don't have a queue to a department that

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,910
is that bake it right have I wish we did

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,100
so putting it out there is to see how it

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:12,250
works is one of the best ways we can

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,220
test anything and sometimes in a deer

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,900
goes up there and that didn't work and

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,790
then it just goes away but the good idea

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:27,250
to stay and eventually ends up in

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:31,080
enterprise version so prepare this is

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,080
what you need to do to run an open shift

00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:40,900
done that creates much server with with

00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,930
running PHP and a database back-end this

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,690
execution less than 10 second if you

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:52,510
have a local boxes can be as you know

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:54,610
close to five that's your wait time but

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,830
this actually does is several things it

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,900
not only creates the gear it clones the

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,690
repo to your local machine it's all

00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,020
ready for you to start coding after this

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:08,580
so your next step is go to the directory

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:13,120
where the new application is located

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:16,450
start adding some file start coding put

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,940
it into your good is that command

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:23,650
foreign 21 because this is sir sometimes

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:25,000
the level of my get knowledge this is

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,820
the new command you may not use that

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,890
often push because what you actually

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,220
have is a clone of the repo that is

00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:35,260
inside the gear so all you're doing is

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,350
saying oh if you take my repo push it up

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:41,560
to where it actually belongs that

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:44,320
deploys that does all the work for you

00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,919
and then you just go through what

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:55,149
when you're done so really your time is

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:58,539
spent where it's fun there right yes

00:28:55,149 --> 00:29:00,730
when I do I see it does a complete clone

00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:03,059
and you get the repo so if you don't

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,950
tell so this command doesn't tell it

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,480
what is the application right and I'm

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,730
going to show one with way actually give

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,649
it's a source code reference and say go

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,529
out to get and plug it in with this code

00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,909
so i can start from that so because if

00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:17,980
we don't want to give you a blank side

00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,960
that comes up at a fall fall we put in a

00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,909
single file usually a static HTML file

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,259
like a well hello world that's what

00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:26,139
you're going to find in your directory

00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:31,750
checked in that's it and now you can

00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:33,490
start adding some more cool stuff and a

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,289
little bit about Jenkins because a lot

00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,759
of times it's not enough to just compile

00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:38,889
a bill you've got to be able to control

00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:42,490
when your test scenarios verify that

00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:44,320
everything is done according to spec all

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:48,970
you need to do is associate you give a

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,169
Jenkins once you've associated it well

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,820
before you can do that you need to have

00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:53,649
a Jenkins gear that's how you create a

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,720
continuum ski again a couple seconds

00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:57,250
you're done it does create a weird

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,539
password the first time so the first

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,129
thing I usually do is I sign on this

00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,720
admin with the new password and changes

00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:04,090
something i can remember because it's a

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,750
scrambled one but other than that is

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,909
right out of the box and then what i can

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,169
do is i can say ok now have Dinkins and

00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:16,750
i have an existing gear just go in and

00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:18,879
add Jenkins abilities at this up here to

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,379
it it links it up creates the job and

00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:23,679
Jenkins so the project links the task

00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:25,539
and when I now hit get push in runs the

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,320
Jenkins job to build it instead of

00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:31,120
running a built locally and I can log on

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,759
to Jenkins and I can change and I can

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,169
control how that bill works so if I want

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,299
to add all these cool additions to

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,980
verify my code run all my tests and get

00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,919
reports back and email my boss if

00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:46,929
everything is okay that's there and runs

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:51,759
automatically how do you get started if

00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:55,090
I do the demo open chef com anyone can

00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,750
sign up for free we do you do need an

00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,030
email address

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,980
the only thing I've seen emails on is

00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,300
basically when the server goes down for

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,580
maintenance Oh lately we've been

00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,100
cleaning up so people like me to hit old

00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,930
apps we hadn't used for a long time got

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,190
an email saying you haven't used it so

00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,530
if you're not interested we're going to

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,040
delete it for you those are the kind of

00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,450
emails that I've been getting that set

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,770
another way is well I don't want to

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,160
rerun it in a class I want I want my own

00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:24,080
stuff well a couple of options the whole

00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,380
community project is hosted on openshift

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,180
get hotter drier you lots of good

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,620
examples out there explanations for how

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,160
to install on different platforms and

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:36,590
here is the basic sauce coats go ahead

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,270
help yourself openshift is based on

00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,980
rupee so it helps being a Ruby

00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,760
programmer if you want to extend or want

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:46,490
to contribute to the project that's it

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,980
it's not that tough if you do want to do

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:52,310
it simpler within existing sent us or

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,780
send OS installation for instance this

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,190
guy here has all the installation

00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:58,070
basically it's a single shell script

00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,870
Iran on the box it will validate that

00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,600
everything is there if you tell it to it

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,790
will go and set up the repos write all

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,020
that stuff until you know say okay what

00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,910
I happen to know what I want help broker

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,010
and you will set all the notes up so all

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,920
you need to have is the systems up and

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,900
running and install it all for you to be

00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,810
a developer you do have a prerequisite

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,640
you need the IHC command because you

00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:23,270
need get to but I'm assuming it is

00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:26,480
already there okay so if you haven't

00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:29,360
done Ruby installs before that's install

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,130
a ruby gem or in real world you can do

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,630
yum install are seeing your work strip

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:38,600
so that's as simple as it get n is a

00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,670
very small piece of code it's not a big

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,260
deal it all it does is interface from a

00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:47,540
command line to that rest interface I

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,340
mentioned already the cartridges if you

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,140
are interested in developing cartridges

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,060
this is a great link to go to actually

00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,830
get the car to specification and lots of

00:32:53,060 --> 00:33:00,140
examples of approaches and so on it does

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,570
space itself in llamo so be prepared if

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,540
you're not a fan of that language but

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:09,690
others that format but it is actually

00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:12,539
fairly straightforward to get to so

00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:15,419
I will go behind the podium I hate being

00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:17,100
behind the podium but I can't type on

00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,519
the keyboard unless I do that I'm sorry

00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:33,120
about that yeah I know at some point I'm

00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:34,649
going to learn how to do that going to

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,090
have to switch the terminal over here so

00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:39,000
I can you guys can see what i'm typing

00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:42,690
because i can't see over there and do

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:52,379
this at the same time so hopefully the

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:54,179
mural will work come on there we go see

00:33:52,379 --> 00:34:03,090
you seeing exactly what I'm seeing look

00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:04,710
at that so everyone can see that so as

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,799
you probably notice this is running

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:09,419
inside a vm why did i do that all i'm

00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,040
doing is a browser here well for a

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:12,599
couple reasons i don't want to mess with

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,339
my network on my workstation so

00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,159
everything i do is always localize the

00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:18,419
novia if I screw it up I'm just going up

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:23,099
to be I'm not the workstation that

00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:24,629
depend on everything else for right but

00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,659
other than that this is just a fedora

00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:32,429
via that there's nothing magically about

00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:35,280
it so in here is a browser and as you

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,079
can see I already have Jenkins in there

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,639
and that was just because I may want to

00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,520
show that depending on what you ask me

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,060
questions about but let me ask let me go

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,829
in and say I want to add an application

00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,990
so I'm doing this the browse away the

00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:52,290
nun developer way I think because in the

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,760
end clicking around it's not what i like

00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,379
to do you know if i can run a script to

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,390
do it old is what I like but this is

00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,619
sort of very guided and helps you

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,440
understand a little bit about what's

00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,240
going on so when I say create I get the

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,400
list of all the install cartridges and

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,819
this is where the upside comes in guess

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,829
who defines these cartridges my those

00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:12,599
consciousness is a collaboration of the

00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:16,020
results of the collaboration between the

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,550
apps and you lead developers this is

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,630
this is what we need to do these

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,310
projects these are the type of

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:22,170
technologies and everyone agrees yep

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,160
security is implemented all the

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,470
standards of a fair

00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,930
we get approval and now becomes part of

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:32,010
men you can pick from pre-approve

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,840
already set up to use so you're up the

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,000
upside knows so you're running within

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,260
the right stuff and you're not getting

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,060
that email later when you have to apply

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,560
your coolest app that works and saying

00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,590
well you can't run it like that it's not

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,380
allowed so let's say I want to create a

00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:49,560
set of PHP up I'll just hit the PSP

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,840
button and it gets me to a screen that

00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,820
basically asking a very few questions

00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,760
and the only one I need to answer is

00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,470
what to give it a name what name to give

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,670
it sorry switch that those words around

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:04,380
so I can call it whatever notice that it

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,140
actually tells me the URL that I'm

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,240
working on so this URL is partly

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,810
prefixed so the first part is

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,660
example.com and my local installation

00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,010
that's what I paid so that comes some

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,870
from your infrastructure then most

00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,580
likely will be our employer your project

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,580
name Ecuador project at all or something

00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:26,280
like that the next part the one called

00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,350
here is actually my domain that i define

00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,900
on my account and i can have many

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,580
domains they can define different access

00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,470
so you can share with team members to

00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,820
some team members I'm access to one

00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,380
domain so you can work together on the

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,480
same projects all kinds of our cool

00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:44,450
stuff but most cases you will just need

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,250
one and then the app name that's it so

00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:50,370
by doing that I have a unique name by

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,960
host name right so when I create my app

00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,000
I what we decided what host name to give

00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,690
up now I know we all wanted to be called

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,520
you know WWE my best app com that can

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,100
still be done once we have it created

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,220
you can go in and add an alias but this

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:09,240
is how openshift knows your your your

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,220
application during development if I have

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,320
existing source code and it could be in

00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,290
github it could certainly also be local

00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,670
I give it there if I don't give it

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,500
anything it just gives me that static

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,750
hello world and then these two down here

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,140
are not allowing me to do any choices

00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,580
because I have a very small installation

00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,080
but in essence what what can happen

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,180
behind the scene is we can have multiple

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,480
sizes of installations or kieres

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,730
available so some apps works fine very

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,080
like small most PHP sonra carlo

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:45,930
resources but try java app and you may

00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,670
need a little bit more now go be honest

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,640
java once in the same size here this

00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:53,520
fact it is 512 megabytes that is to find

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,540
a of memory that is defined as how small

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,820
gear and i have deployed many wraps on a

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,859
good job we're the ones happily within

00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,840
that now have I have hundreds of

00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:07,500
thousands of users accessing them x is

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,930
new but they will run fine for at least

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,570
a standard type application with a

00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:15,480
back-end database that does quite kind

00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,340
of stuff so because I only have one gear

00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,350
size available in my my current I can

00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,490
own I can't do a drop down here but they

00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,100
would normally tell you what you have

00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,330
access to upsize is this is also what

00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,800
tells you what environment you're going

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,320
to so there will be for instance or you

00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,270
have smaller of your small in QA and so

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,580
on and they might be slightly different

00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,619
in resources they may allow you

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,540
different things that you can do you may

00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,320
allow more disk space in QA than in

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,720
development for instance or particularly

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,460
production versus your test that's all

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,780
something that can be set up behind the

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,940
scenes that controls with those names

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,290
mean you're definitely you're basically

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:54,090
just defining the environment you're in

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:57,359
by picking the right name this Chi here

00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,920
I'm not going to set but what this does

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,690
is to allow you skip your application to

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,750
automatically scale depending on demand

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:07,320
all I have to do is set it down to scale

00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:09,300
of web traffic so once your app becomes

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,740
the best apps in slide cheese everyone

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,119
knows that they got to download the app

00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,380
and the mobile phone and you have

00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,170
hundreds of thousands of users are

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,330
hitting it when the request weight

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,980
skirts up and the gear gets so busy that

00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,720
it reads that rate it will automatically

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,900
make another copy and another copy on

00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,990
until it can meet the demand and scale

00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,580
up you didn't do anything and then when

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:33,840
it hits the our way around it will scale

00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,400
back so now as an operator I can have an

00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,930
infrastructure where I can have 10 apps

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,820
that may be different busy at different

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,869
interval at different times and they can

00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,410
all share the same infrastructure the

00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:42,410
same resources

00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,839
so I hit create application and if i'm

00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:51,369
not mistaken i just restarted the vm i

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,619
don't know what it is but my cab IAM

00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:57,460
screws up every time I sweet my machines

00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:59,440
I have to reboot my boxes that's it it's

00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,839
created an app for me it's out there

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,670
it's deployed it gives me a little bit

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,920
of okay we've never done this before

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:11,469
here is your next steps okay so it tells

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,269
me because I have done this on the web I

00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:15,630
gotta you know in order for me to get

00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:17,799
ahold of source code I need to clone the

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:20,380
application and here's the command to do

00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:22,749
that the funny thing is that this is

00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,999
correct but we have a shortcut for that

00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:26,589
command i'm going to show you I don't

00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:29,920
need to copy that whole thing anymore

00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:31,390
your diversions we have to and then it

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,099
also tells you they are not you skate

00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,529
before this is how you commit alright so

00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,910
a little bit of help but I want to go

00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:40,180
and get it really get started here so

00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:43,450
here's the actual management my edit

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,920
page of my app so this allows me to

00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,049
actually add additional so i can add a

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,140
database for your feature by just

00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:51,819
clicking here i can add jenkins support

00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,440
and so on or i can just go to the

00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:56,170
application by clicking there this is my

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,119
application one if you see very

00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,739
carefully I don't know how readable it

00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:06,430
is but that's the URL that we created

00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:08,859
before full app granted is just an index

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,630
eight does PHP it's not really a lot of

00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:13,059
sexy stuff going on let me show you what

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:17,319
the code looks like that one is probably

00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:22,319
way too small for you so I will go in

00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,319
here and hopes that's probably too big

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:38,859
is that better to read or easier to read

00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:47,500
okay so I see command git clone and I

00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:49,539
call this first right I can write the

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,950
git clone command to and then give it a

00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:56,579
holy oil this is the shortcut so it said

00:41:53,950 --> 00:42:02,289
i cloned it i added electrical first

00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:04,510
there is and ok there's a couple of more

00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:06,460
files but this because we can actually

00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,930
create is a whole PHP engine so there's

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,079
a couple more dependencies there but the

00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:13,980
only app in the PHP is the index and

00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,210
then it adds a health index that allows

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,500
the system to actually paying itself

00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,690
they are seen by other gears up

00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:26,400
responding or not so let me go and just

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:30,369
do the biggest development change ever

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,099
just go down so because it's a single

00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,869
file everything is in here I would have

00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,109
shot my developers back then if they did

00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:37,109
that

00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,869
you may notice that it's not straight up

00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:49,890
HTML that we are using anymore it's mere

00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:51,940
this is very much the html5 world of

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,920
allowing this page so if you look nice

00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:58,869
on a browser to meaning on a phone to

00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:13,150
not just in a big browser oops so I can

00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:16,900
go in here and just do an h2 and that's

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:19,630
it now going to do a lot now I'll do my

00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:28,539
get at which I really don't need because

00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:30,339
only editor file so from it so notice

00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,859
when I built that I get all this weird

00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:34,749
stuff happening this is the built

00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:37,839
actually happen to get when I push now

00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:39,579
exactly building my stuff and that's

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,319
defined by the cartridge so by

00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:44,019
customizing the conscious you can define

00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:47,140
what that process is all there's some

00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:48,940
hooks defined in a secret directory

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,339
called dot open shift in your project

00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,960
where you can set put in hooks run this

00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:55,420
when I'm build it after four before

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,819
built after built or before deploy after

00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,499
deploy so you can customize this project

00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:02,819
to your need so you still have that

00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:05,950
control you're not giving up anything I

00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:07,719
did my deployment and to prove that they

00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:12,369
actually happen i refresh this page and

00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:14,619
is updated that's the process now I

00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:17,979
granted we don't do development with

00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:20,819
such a simple file I get that so I let

00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:23,680
me do something a little more complex

00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:26,349
let's say I want to do an open wordpress

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,799
installation all right god I need PHP I

00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:33,009
gotta need a database and I need your

00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:35,589
WordPress installed so I did something

00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:38,680
like people do on TV when they cook so

00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:41,739
they prepare because I can't remember

00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,749
anything anymore so I couldn't remember

00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:47,440
that you are all here but this is the

00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:50,360
command that I need to fire oops hit the

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,250
right key and usually helps so

00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:56,840
this is the icy command to create an

00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:59,180
application it creates a application

00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,520
called WordPress based on PHP but on my

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,230
sequel back end and then it says instead

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,410
of using their oh hello world in the it

00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:09,920
use this code instead i'm hoping i have

00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:13,400
a connection i did not verify so it may

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,710
fail but it should work it'll take a

00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:20,470
little longer because it does need to

00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:23,750
download everything first but that's it

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:27,140
so what it did tell me was a lot of cool

00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:32,300
stuff now i can say well you know before

00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:35,930
i really do anything Oh WordPress tell

00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:40,550
me a little bit about oops I thought we

00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:46,040
could do that it's called show now dawn

00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:47,120
don't like changes there's a little bit

00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,950
of information what's out there

00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,570
including what's my database stuff and

00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,540
you can say oh cool now I know what to

00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,610
put in there don't do that because this

00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:59,870
changes when i move my gear round in

00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:01,250
structural so this is actually represent

00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,700
if you notice the connection you well

00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:07,310
there's some nasty environment names

00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,190
going on the username and passwords are

00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:12,290
part of that your connection needs to

00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,870
use that to be open sea of compliant

00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:16,880
that's what this wordpress installation

00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:20,840
did so all i need to do now is I need I

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:23,270
deployed my code and let me go back here

00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,670
and lo and behold see I now have my gear

00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:28,280
here listed notice that I'm limited to

00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:29,990
25 years so I can actually set limits

00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,800
for individual users for how much they

00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:35,810
can do the website is called that

00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,730
because this is my domain so WordPress

00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:42,290
there so when I hit this one it will

00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:48,920
this is WordPress running see I've been

00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:50,840
here before I had to I tried all kinds

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:55,360
of passwords even long ones they kept

00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,360
calling them all week what's going on

00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,090
yeah yeah so install WordPress

00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:12,510
don't do you tip running so now i have a

00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,860
wordpress installation i have all source

00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,320
code so if i need to go in and adjust

00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,730
something and see how it works i have it

00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,470
all i just need to change the gear and

00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:25,890
go log into the directory that we have

00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:32,670
which i can go into that's what I'm in

00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:36,320
here so here's the PHP sometimes I'm not

00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,320
too good at figuring our way puts things

00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:52,140
hmm interesting I didn't expect you to

00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:57,600
show up in there and now it's show

00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:58,950
something up and that's not it sorry by

00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,720
that it should have been in there I'm

00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:04,140
not sure why it doesn't show up let me

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:11,900
cloned it again just to make sure I got

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:18,690
the right thing I see get blown

00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:25,740
WordPress not sure it should be in there

00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:27,090
it's not that is odd so this is what

00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,830
happens when they cooked it and check it

00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:31,860
first I need to figure out whether

00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:35,270
that's a buck or not but it may simply

00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:38,100
be me not knowing where it keeps files

00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:47,390
so let me do the nasty little search

00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:47,390
here and it may have done something

00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,590
nasty like putting it in because this is

00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,450
actually a guid repo that was made

00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:56,760
specifically for open / fall for

00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:58,290
wordpress and you may have figured out

00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,490
well we don't want to install that 010

00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:02,940
again we just put it in a sense of

00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:07,880
location refer to it and that may be

00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,880
what I'm looking at here and

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:14,930
see the database setup is in here uses

00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,490
old environment variables and I'm trying

00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:25,400
to figure out where the root is set for

00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:31,270
the actual application so i should be

00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,270
able to find w content but maybe not

00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:42,560
nope so that will be the boobs that I

00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:45,320
kind of knew what's going to happen even

00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,030
though it's wide it's there but somehow

00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,150
not showing up because the code is

00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:54,410
definitely running and it should be in

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:57,230
the PHP so I gotta remember to test

00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:59,810
certain things before I say them but the

00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:02,030
whole idea of doing this exercises i

00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:05,900
mean i can use someone else's git repo

00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:09,800
and have my project in disguise and now

00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:12,109
i can easily change the code CD effects

00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,660
I can use the command line as I'm here

00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:16,490
or i can use my IDE and you might go

00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:18,260
well if though this is running on a

00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:20,630
separate server all my debugging how is

00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,829
that going to work I'm going to set you

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,510
know there's these little processes we

00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:25,220
start that can allow me to step by step

00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,839
two different processes and see what

00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,670
where I screwed up because that's

00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:32,119
usually me that makes the air or not to

00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:34,010
code well then we have a port forward on

00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:36,650
the gears we have all kinds of access to

00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:48,410
this gear running so I'm not on the

00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:52,599
actual box here so this is my ah so I

00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,599
actually put that in wrong directory but

00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:58,970
did I nope

00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,950
so I can do this all kinds of RS

00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,770
increments so one of the commands that

00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:07,970
we have is what's really going on on

00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:14,360
this box alright so now I'm an ssh

00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:17,300
actually on the running server this is

00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:20,300
all this is all I can see this is my

00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,760
running application and I can kill those

00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:33,950
processes and all that stuff just like I

00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:36,280
can do all yeah it's not cold apps etl

00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,280
anymore

00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:49,430
go back here and I can say it should be

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,650
called locks it's not called out anymore

00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:58,190
either no it's called tail it's my lock

00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:59,720
going on what's going on so I have still

00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:03,260
have access to that I can do port

00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,950
forwarding so my debugging will work so

00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:08,480
I can do my step by step I can add I

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:11,120
mean I basically have a full running

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,560
server I never had to set up all the

00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,100
stuff that you're used to all your log

00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:18,590
files to file when you deploy them are

00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,270
there you can even chip to a degree if

00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:22,400
you allow by the contrast you can still

00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:25,550
change your patches to come if you want

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,800
to or the httpd.conf it may be locked

00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,810
down it may say that you can't do that

00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,300
again that is what the compromise goes

00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,040
into whether you do certain changes

00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,680
would you have access with PHP to PHP I

00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:39,470
and I or is that something that is given

00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,330
out to you to something to start from it

00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,760
may already come with a lot of files to

00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:45,020
say here's the connector for here's what

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,670
you need to do for security so it may

00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,230
already have those classes to find that

00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,330
quote defines so it just comes

00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:55,040
pre-configured and you don't have to

00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:56,480
provide it that's the whole idea of this

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,650
becomes the collaboration and the

00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,790
meeting point between you and your

00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,470
operating skies and security guys

00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:05,870
because they now know that you have this

00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:10,430
sandbox to do whatever you want you

00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:12,230
within that predefined limit and you can

00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,910
create a you know you can have all kinds

00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,190
of different you doesn't have to be a

00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:17,780
single PHP gear that's for all PHP

00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,690
applications you can make a cartridge

00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,730
for one type of PFP application or

00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,730
another one maybe we want to Java or a

00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:29,120
pearl whatever and just create a huge

00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:30,740
arsenal depending on what type of you

00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,270
know idea is that you want to try to

00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,760
implement what kind of resources do you

00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:38,570
need or what kind of frameworks do you

00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,470
need rather behind the scene and then

00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,210
when you come up and said well this

00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:45,350
framework is not available then add it

00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,940
to encourage talking for a long time I

00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,680
know I didn't show the source code so

00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,440
I'm very sorry by that but any other

00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,150
question any questions that doesn't lead

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,980
with me being embarrassed for not having

00:53:53,150 --> 00:54:02,390
it work

00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:05,869
yes so the question was do I have to use

00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:08,480
get for the actual communication yes but

00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:10,310
what we have done with subversion for

00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,250
instance is the predominant is to simply

00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:15,230
set up a hook on the subversion side

00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,790
that automatically sets up to give

00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,170
because they doesn't care where it comes

00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,730
from so once you chuck it into

00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:22,490
subversion you can run the hook that all

00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:25,070
the mac senses to the gear so that's one

00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:27,710
way of doing it the problem we have with

00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,940
subversion really is not agile enough to

00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,109
do what we need because one of the

00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,500
things get can do is it creates

00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:34,940
literally a local repo and it allows you

00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,530
to have repos all over the place and

00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,180
it's a lot easier to manage stand having

00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,130
this centralized idea of everything goes

00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,869
into a central place having to manage

00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,580
tags and all kinds of other stuff to

00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:50,570
figure out what you're doing particular

00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:52,940
when your tea any other question yes so

00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:54,320
as you saw DNS integration was the

00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:59,119
question so as you saw the whole thing

00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:01,520
was me telling it a name so really it's

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,240
up to who whatever you want to use for

00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,250
DNS out of the box we give you bind so

00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,450
if you just do this default install you

00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,970
get a fine buying server that is

00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:14,210
dynamically updated with its own or two

00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:17,930
how many you want so every time you

00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:20,119
create an app it gets a new scene II so

00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,950
one of the things is that confuses a lot

00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,070
of people is that the apps don't get

00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:27,080
separate IPS now if you have many notes

00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:30,980
each note has an IP and that would be

00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,830
reflected but each app gets a cname if

00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:39,130
we talk to you next week that points to

00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:42,130
the node where it's located that's it

00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,130
yeah

00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:53,180
so we have their plugins without through

00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:55,250
tree that you can use or three or 53 how

00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:58,730
can I put this last time I'll read the

00:55:55,250 --> 00:56:00,980
route 53 conditions they basically said

00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,950
we don't guarantee an update to come out

00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:07,610
any sooner than 30 minutes which kind of

00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:09,650
kills this whole idea they may not be

00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:12,410
the case for normal use but that's what

00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,940
their condition says so we've had you

00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:17,240
know we can make the plugin but we not

00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:19,490
have success I mean at the same level

00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:22,790
we've had with others in response times

00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:24,680
from it but it can be done what I did

00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,750
with some route 50 trees was assembly

00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:32,110
set up a forward to an hour's dns server

00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:32,110
and you couldn't see the difference yes

00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,090
so there is i think we are time so let

00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,890
me answer this question and i'll be

00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,990
happy to stay stay here and answer more

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:53,750
questions okay so there is a highway

00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,460
lability option that you can enable that

00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:58,100
allow the basically says the gear has to

00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,680
be in so many replicas for it to to be

00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,000
high available so by doing that you will

00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,820
be on you need to have more than one

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,190
node one in which i don't and so you can

00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:09,020
you can take a failure of any of them

00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,880
and you will be up and running and you

00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,830
can set up as a condition or as a

00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,300
property on your gear as administrator

00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,950
that this gear has to have X number of

00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,590
instances running it all the time and

00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:21,140
can go up to why number of instances so

00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,970
you can set the limits of them now that

00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,380
will not be something that the developer

00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,760
does that is on the album shift

00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:29,510
administration side but those are

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,310
parameters that you can set so I said I

00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:32,990
will be happy to go outside and and

00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:35,090
answer more questions so we can get the

00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,380
next speaker or you guys can go to lunch

00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:38,680
I guess because that's in a couple of

00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,680
minutes

00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,390
your customers rely on your website or

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,790
application if it's slower

00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:24,730
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:26,530
and costs you money keeping your

00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:30,040
business critical systems humming along

00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:32,890
requires insight into what they're doing

00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,870
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:37,360
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:39,280
resource limitations and other problems

00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,200
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,810
your systems performance metrics in

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,660
real-time and record this data for later

00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:48,640
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,680
see what's really going on under the

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,780
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,790
visualize the status of all your systems

00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:57,520
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:58:54,790 --> 00:59:00,640
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,340
memory swap processes load and network

00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,680
usage click a specific system to access

00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,660
its individual dashboard then click and

00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,690
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:12,670
more detail comprehensive network data

00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:15,370
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,960
is available on the network tab and disk

00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,850
rights and free space on the disk

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,700
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:24,250
displays usage statistics for individual

00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:26,410
processes the system info tab shows

00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:28,660
listening services active connections

00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:30,790
and available updates adding long view

00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,470
to a system is easy just click the

00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:34,630
button copy the one line installation

00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:37,060
command then run the command on your

00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:38,770
linux system to complete the process the

00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,930
agent will begin collecting data and

00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:42,789
sending it to longview then the graph

00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:45,369
start rolling

00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:47,739
use longview to gain visibility into

00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:51,479
your servers so when your website or app

00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:51,479
