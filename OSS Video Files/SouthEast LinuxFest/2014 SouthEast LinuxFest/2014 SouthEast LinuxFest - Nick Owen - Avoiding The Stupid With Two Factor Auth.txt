the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

pc org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,130
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,890
videos possible ok welcome hello

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,140
everyone my name is Nick Owen I'm the

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,960
CEO and co-founder of wicked systems we

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,280
are a dual source self as did two-factor

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,340
authentication solution provider based

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,100
in Atlanta Georgia in fact were the

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,059
leading dual host doolittle source cell

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000
phones to two-factor authentication

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,129
solution provider based in Atlanta I'm

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,860
going to talk to you about two-factor

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,730
authentication primarily about sort of

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,199
what the options are around it as my

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,090
mother-in-law says consider the source

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,430
we're obviously a bit on the bias side

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,039
but I think hopefully I'll challenge you

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,640
to think about some issues around some

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,170
of these different options let me talk

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,180
about implementation sort of what we see

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,530
and what we recommend as the best way to

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,490
implement them and what to think about

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,540
when you do implement them and I'll

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,490
start off by talking about what some of

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,530
the bad guys are doing and how why it

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,790
makes so much sense to do this hopefully

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,939
I'm talking to preaching to the choir

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,560
but I'll cover some facts for you I

00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:28,080
apologize in advance all my images are

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,430
from that are bad taxidermy and bad

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,570
album covers if you're familiar with

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,619
those memes it's going to be pretty bad

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,860
we don't have a really corporate

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,750
graphics department suffer so first I

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,979
want to say thanks to this self guys

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:47,310
this is I think my fourth or fifth self

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:48,570
and always enjoy it a lot of fun if

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,030
you're around tomorrow which I've

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,979
everyone is b-sides Charlotte is

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,430
tomorrow it's one of the tracks so

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,909
besides is a information security

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,490
conference meme for lack of better word

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,649
we're usually opposite some larger

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,110
conference like our essay or black hat

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,310
that's become kind of corporate there's

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,540
a non-corporate self kind of created

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,400
conference

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,799
i hook the b-side charlotte guys up with

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,290
the self guys so that's my little mike

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:21,870
reclaim the theme so anyway enjoy the

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,209
conference it's a lot of fun alright so

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,849
I'm going to talk about what attackers

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,409
do and some of this is probably old hat

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,299
to a lot of people but actually there

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,280
are some facts around this back like

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:36,959
facts are you all familiar with the

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,220
verizon dbr report so Verizon their

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,290
information skating practice has been

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,239
doing while like with fifth year no tent

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,340
the arms are 10th year they have been

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,439
gathering information about the tax and

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,280
analyzing them in a systematic way to

00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:59,400
sort of you know have information around

00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,049
what attackers do they you could say

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,250
it's a little biased it's a small sample

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,720
pool you know they get their information

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,669
they get information with the Secret

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,730
Service there's a lot of larger

00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,930
customers a lot of PCI stuff but it's

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,480
really kind of some of the best data

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,430
that we have and what their data tells

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,169
us is that authentication is very

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,030
important when you look at what

00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:23,430
attackers do by hacking methods for of

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,169
the top nine exploitation of default or

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,199
guessable passwords use of stolen

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,120
credentials use of insufficient

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,489
authentication you know this is what

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,340
attackers are doing they get in that way

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,709
and escalate that way if you look at the

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,680
this is ranked by breaches and this is

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,810
two years ago information keyloggers

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,030
stolen credentials brute force

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,819
dictionary attacks so in addition to

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,299
things like you know sequel injection

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:53,579
tampering but you know all the other

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,970
ways half of them are always involves

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,889
some form of authentication this

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,139
continues to this year from this year's

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,689
debe ir which if you haven't read it a

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:07,799
highly recommend you read it it's like

00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:09,269
maybe 40 pages it's very readable but

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,939
very very compelling from the

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,729
information three-quarters of all

00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:18,590
attacks use some form of authentication

00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:20,190
attack either to get in or to escalate

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,049
additionally what they'll tell you is

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,210
the vast majority of these are coming

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,490
from the outside so while you may be

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,539
worried about employees

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,090
most of the attacks currently our

00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:31,190
company outside 40 plus percent the vast

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,750
majority are targeting servers right why

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,069
because that's where the data is the

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:40,190
data is the money sadly it is taking

00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:43,310
weeks to months to discover attacks that

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,849
have been going on for you know that

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,949
take hours for them to execute take

00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:51,650
months press discover i read the day

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,500
that the PF changs breach was going off

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,380
about nine months so they've gone back

00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,970
to paper which you can just imagine

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:05,360
there's a guy at sells carbon copy paper

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:09,139
going alright so that's the bad news but

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,289
if you look at what verizon recommends

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:15,380
all right time to get tough well getting

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,759
tough is really almost all basics right

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,830
it's two factor auth which has been

00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,509
around for a long time segmenting the

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,800
network which is your PCI compliant

00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,009
you're already doing butts by not doing

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,380
enough of it logging AV and malware

00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:28,849
detection you know if you're running

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,770
your own software a better input

00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:33,139
validation monitoring outbound traffic

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,120
patching disabling Java in the browser

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,039
you know this is these kind of

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,050
recommendations are really kind of basic

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,990
leveraging threat feeds and you know

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,180
does anyone do that threat feeds I don't

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,250
get threat beads so you know that's like

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,820
your list list of bad evil IP addresses

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,870
and stuff like that ETD are does anyone

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,610
know what that stands for because I've

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,190
already forgotten I think it's some kind

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,900
of data loss prevention stuff typically

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,669
if it are if it still has two acronyms

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,530
it's not quite ready for deployment in

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:05,150
my mind so that's a fairly sophisticated

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,210
in terms of what you would do but all

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,030
this other stuff is really basics so I'm

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,380
going to talk about to factor all talk

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,699
about the options and I'll talk a little

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,099
bit about segmenting the network and

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,599
some tricks you can probably do to help

00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:20,449
increase your security without breaking

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,099
the bank all right so we're all familiar

00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,479
with two factor auth you know pin

00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,319
password something you know something

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:30,500
you have a hardware token smart card

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,840
something you are a biometric right but

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,940
in reality all these things come to us

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,120
through computer systems right so it's

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,690
really a representation

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,250
these things and you know so you really

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,479
then you're still you're still just

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,860
you're taking your risk you're just

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,389
better taking a better risk and that

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,290
becomes important because what you need

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,889
to know is that they need to be

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,180
replaceable and this is the this is what

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,130
everyone found out when our essay was

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,620
breached is that these things sometimes

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,900
need to be replaced and that was a lot

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,800
of pain for a number of people but it

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,660
was but they did it and it was done all

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,190
right i hope i don't have to say this

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:20,430
but two of one factor is not to factor

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:26,479
it's just one factor you know hmm good

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,479
what oh yes right oh yeah yeah I don't

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,650
so he's saying thanks your banks are

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,860
convinced that that a pin plus a

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,400
password is two-factor authentication

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,830
the other one I like is the image think

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,810
the picture yeah so this is this I have

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,120
this in another presentation but i have

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,520
this it you can still do this I maybe

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,919
bankas bank of america still do it you

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,860
do to yogli labs and it's like they

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,110
don't understand that you know really

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,000
what's happening is this a server is

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,490
sending you an image it's like that's

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,560
HTTP 10 I mean this is really not

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:13,680
encryption at all so I'm base this on a

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,110
scenario you know I've just ran with

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
jasmine if you're a retailer this is

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,910
kind of typical of what we see as

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,970
customers growing regional you may be

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,650
PCP second client or you need to be it's

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,440
where itself so I'll see you've got ldap

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,060
and running Linux servers typically what

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,380
we see is your running ad and you have

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,820
linux servers we often see a mix of

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,959
especially the larger the customer the

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,970
more mix we see in terms of BYOD and

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,110
what you have on your desktop

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,730
except for our very smallest planets we

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,930
always see sort of a sprawling network

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,820
if you're a retailer then you're going

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,390
to have a point of sale network you'll

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,730
have a network for your branches you'll

00:08:53,390 --> 00:09:01,430
have a home network or maybe something

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:03,320
for the warehouses and you know this

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,120
could easily be a dot edu where you have

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,950
yeah you might have a PCI compliance for

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,080
processing credit cards for students and

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,080
alumni you'd have HR you'd have a

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,030
finance and hopefully it's a novel flat

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,380
so I'm just this is just a basis for

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,190
what what I want you to think about

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,230
because one of the things we'll be

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:25,760
looking at is does this form of

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,960
authentication work for me so we'll do a

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,640
little bit of strategic planning right

00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,880
and we'll think about what will you be

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,950
protecting who will be using it a lot of

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,230
times we'll see okay the PCI odor is

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,700
coming on Monday it's Friday kcra's

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,560
coming on monday we need to factor all

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,870
okay no problem they all know the

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,390
software get the server setup you know

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,020
we'll get it running but they aren't

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,580
really thinking about the next step

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,280
because you know when target was

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,600
breached it wasn't through their pci

00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,000
compliant division it was through a

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,420
third party right it was that HEA HVAC

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,220
contractor and you need to be thinking

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,200
about the fact that it may not just be

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,180
your employees it may be customers and

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,920
maybe third parties it may not just be

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,930
your sis admin's and maybe you know

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:15,050
marketing HR and accounting what else

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,060
did you look for in general the biggest

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,880
cost in two factor auth is typically the

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,680
credential issuance and reassurance so

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,160
anything you can do to automate that

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,980
process or manage it better again you

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,730
know you look at the RSA breach and at

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,850
various companies around the world big

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,890
boxes of RSA tokens came in and they

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,630
would stuff an envelope fedex envelope

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,460
would be stuffed with that and sent to

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,600
an executive and it was the information

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,100
security guy that was doing that because

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,880
you can't you know you can't outsource

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,770
that kind of thing logging if you look

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,850
at what deep verizon recommends and what

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,620
you should be doing is a lot more

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,030
logging logging to a sim so you can get

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,990
more intelligence out of your logs

00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,370
I'm a big believer in this and you know

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,170
anything y'all want to see in terms of

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,850
logging we did we wrote we wrote a

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,740
plug-in for Haley in vaults of alien

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,230
vaults are seen we've got a plug and

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,180
started there you need to have those

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:14,070
logs and you need to be able to look at

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:16,470
them and use them API I think you know

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,470
we're everything I'm going to tell you

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:24,180
pretty much is use radius use a standard

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:26,520
protocol don't don't try and be special

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,050
about this but at the end of the day

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,720
you're going to want an API because you

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,400
may want your customer service reps able

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
to add or delete a user at a recent a

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,720
user you may want HR to be able to do

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,020
that you're going to want to automate

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,800
some things our API is available on

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,180
sourceforge it's lgpl some of our

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,830
competitors you have to you know pay

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,470
more for that or you have to talk to a

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,210
sales person and I know developers love

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,430
talking to salespeople so that may be

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,250
may be able to work for you but I would

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,260
take a look at that as well I'll cover

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,440
some costs and actually i'm just going

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,560
to mostly cover hidden costs so i don't

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,180
have anything specific about costs

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,780
except for where they might crop up

00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,150
where you least expect them and same for

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,580
security risks i'm not you know i think

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,470
if you do to factor off you lock down

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,930
your VPN and we'll talk about segmenting

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,250
and some other things you're going to

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,470
get a lot better handle on your security

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,150
but when you're choosing a two-factor

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,550
authentication system you need to think

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,570
about the security of that system and

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,490
whatever lies on but the best reason for

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,740
currently unit is to get rid of

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,880
passwords and I think it's a funny it's

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,020
been you know so we've been doing this

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,000
for a long time and if the longest time

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,250
even itself my eye was always saying

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,990
like okay two-factor authentication is

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,520
like an ATM card you know the pin and

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,160
you have the card so it's more secure

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,170
and then they kind of got it a couple

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,700
years ago it's like okay tell me how you

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,500
do two off two factor auth are you like

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,150
Google are you like you know and the

00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,550
biggest thing that sea change of

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,600
everything was the mat Honan attack does

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,330
everyone know about the math he's the

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,610
guy who you know rights for wired and

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,699
someone broke into his account deleted

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,329
all his I fruit devices

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:13,579
and God is like Amazon account and I was

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:14,839
just like you know this is surely this

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,429
is not going to be it but it was such a

00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,529
watershed moment where all the sudden

00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:24,639
like your mother knows kind of my mother

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:24,639
also knew what I did but we've gone we

00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:32,119
exactly so but what we've what we have

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:33,739
now i think is a situation where

00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:37,129
everyone's like oh my god any two factor

00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:41,600
auth so we're adding it on instead of

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:44,660
instead of getting rid of passwords and

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,649
i think that's a mistake all right so

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,809
let's talk about the options out there

00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:49,790
i'm not even going to cover smart cards

00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,350
because you know the only people i know

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,869
the new smart cards are the government

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,299
military military contractors and

00:13:53,869 --> 00:14:00,790
microsoft so if you're not a monopoly

00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:02,779
it's probably not in your budget but

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,869
biometrics are kind of interesting now

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,970
and they're you know it's it's possible

00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:11,779
that you would have a biometric on your

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,759
laptop or your smartphone and so the

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:15,980
cost could be low enough where it's

00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,389
tempting to do it there are some

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,579
problems with it though i mean i think

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,899
if you're looking at it in terms of

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,139
replacing the password the lock down

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,329
your smartphone that's probably fine

00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,160
your smartphone is quite covered with

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,220
your fingerprints so there may be

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:36,160
problems for a determinate attacker but

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:40,129
to me the issue here is replace ability

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:44,329
what happens when my biometric is stolen

00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:47,509
and you want to implement a biometric

00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:49,369
system right so I you know they're using

00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:52,609
these things now at high schools and

00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:55,699
schools and Jim's what happens if my you

00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:58,039
know I'm going into smart bodies and all

00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,629
of a sudden smart bodies is breached of

00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,189
course the whole network Simeone they

00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:02,660
probably won't even do if you know will

00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:05,059
they even do a forensic analysis to know

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,619
what's been stolen so I just assumed my

00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,049
passwords been my fingerprints been

00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,609
stolen oh they can say it's hashed right

00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:13,039
but just like passwords are hashed one

00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:15,199
no one really doesn't write to it's just

00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,299
a matter of time rights just in time of

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,640
processing power so you can't prove to

00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,800
me my fingerprint hasn't been

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,110
projector then yeah so eight tans are

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,400
going to do I met Renee Tian's that's

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,270
right because no one ever installs the

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,590
scheme around an ATM and I've got to say

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,880
I was like no i'm sorry i can't do my

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,150
bio measure because it was stolen in the

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,120
you know the great hack of gold bodies

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,380
whatever what are they going to do you

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,520
know were they going to say use a

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,410
different finger because some people

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,450
said that well you have ten fingers like

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,370
okay that's great so I've got no bank

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:49,000
you know government whatever you know

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,590
there's like and then I was sucking on

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,940
Twitter with someone who's an IBM guy

00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,050
and he's like what you know and also you

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,820
don't just have to use one you can use

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,900
more than one and all of a sudden I

00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,490
could have pictures like all the sudden

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,930
I'm doing like Dance Dance Revolution to

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,750
try and get money out of it you know the

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,250
bank account like it's just sort of to

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,430
me it's sort of it's just a bad secret

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,170
right I compared it to credit cards

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,000
credit cards are the worst season right

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,380
I literally give it to you so you can

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,100
use it everyone has it they wants to use

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,070
it but logging and replace ability right

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,540
your credit card gets stolen you know

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,270
and they push it all back on the vendor

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,450
anyway you're not adding money and they

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:27,790
send you your car the next day so I

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,100
think we'll so the other thing I'm

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,750
saying is this is really you know for as

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,240
long as they've been around this is

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:38,530
really early apples only release their

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,390
touch ID API a couple days ago so we're

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,770
just looking at replacing a passphrase

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:46,270
on our token on the iphone with touch ID

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,980
so i think it'll be a good use for that

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,360
I we're doing it cuz I know someone's

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,750
going to ask for it even whether or not

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,460
it's a good idea or not and so I think

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,720
it'd be a good in combination with some

00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:00,220
other solution all right so phone based

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,329
systems so this goes a little bit to

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:08,370
what the banks did because in 2010 I

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:12,010
think the FF VI C came out with their 09

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:14,380
updated regulations regarding online

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,839
banking saying you had a stronger form

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,209
of authentication and immediately so you

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,440
know everyone is like it's a huge market

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,410
right it's going to be everyone in the

00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:26,230
world doesn't online banking it has to

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,990
work everywhere for everybody all the

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,790
time it's like okay so you amelie end up

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,960
with like the worst possible solutions

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,399
it's like

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,750
you know in that in that kind of

00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:37,770
requirements is not going to work so

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:41,470
what you get is a lot of dial back texts

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,360
and you know and this is really kind of

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,620
pre some art fundraising they were out

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,909
that everyone had BlackBerry's

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,130
essentially and so I talked itself with

00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:55,360
one of these guy a fortune 500 CEO so

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,919
they had been breached they rebuilt

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,270
their entire network over the weekend

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,029
and brought it back up with a phone

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,970
based solution provider right so it was

00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:07,720
really it was a service so easy easy to

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,970
set up low cost and get started I saw

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,419
about nine months later he was getting

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,289
hammered with Telefonica charges so just

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,240
like you know there's maybe three

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,190
options you can use the free version you

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,690
know there's a text it's a little bit

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,700
more and there's dial back that's a lot

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,320
more expensive well the dial back is

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,390
like the easiest one for all the users

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,950
so everyone was using dial back his

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,620
costs were launching the group and they

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,539
were unkept so you talk about a hidden

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,730
you know a hidden costs and it's totally

00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:36,390
on capped and all assignees into you

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:41,020
know into quite an expensive situation

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:42,669
the other problem I have is not just the

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,029
hidden costs but but hidden security

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:49,630
right so in some cases if you're relying

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:51,100
on SMS or you know to a lesser degree of

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,980
dial back system but certainly SMS

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,110
you're relying on the Vietnam back this

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:02,159
was actually a battle back i think the

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:05,220
security of the carrier and that can be

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:08,169
that can be easily fortunate alright so

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,289
the cloud fire attack was 2014 is a few

00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,909
months before the mat Honan attack and

00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:16,779
cloudflare is a CDN alright so they do

00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:18,460
content delivery network they use google

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:22,360
apps for their infrastructure and the

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,210
CEO was using a gmail and for his backup

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,539
for his personal gmail it was a dial

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,320
back solution and the attackers took

00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:33,309
over his ATT voicemail account and

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,770
requested a password reset for his

00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:37,779
personal account sent to the voicemail

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,190
they used that to log in his personal

00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,990
email account is the backup for his

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,490
corporate account they log in this

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,690
corporate account and they delete all

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,649
his customers

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,059
initially you know they stay sir they

00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,409
get all the data back because actually

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,440
it's a very good blog post about it

00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:53,659
Google stops using voice mail for backup

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,399
it's only text now and their Google

00:19:53,659 --> 00:20:01,549
Authenticator but there is a post

00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:05,059
recently about primarily Australian

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:08,120
carriers Australian carriers primarily

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:11,059
still doing voice mail via caller ID

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,590
right so no requirement for a pin and

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:14,990
this only I mean this was only happened

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,990
in the US like four years ago they

00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:20,210
really started pushing pins and it's

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,399
amazingly they like they own the phone

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:28,720
pretty much and yet still only do caller

00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:31,580
ID so the and the reason is if you're a

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,529
carrier wireless carrier today and you

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,110
increase the security of your accounts

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,720
and it results in a one percent increase

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,789
in your password resets a month that's

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,369
like millions of people so there's

00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:45,039
really they're really in snot incentive

00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,960
to secure this anymore than they have to

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,279
it's the same with encryption why should

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,919
they encrypt that stuff when they just

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:56,570
have to decrypt it for the NSA so when

00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,899
you think about what you're deploying

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,279
and then and again I'm biased this could

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:03,440
be great for you this could be the thing

00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,110
that really makes sense and it fits with

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,299
your risk profile but just know that

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:12,190
you're relying on the carriers for their

00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:15,980
security and think about what that means

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:19,070
okay so we also see this you know with

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:21,440
it now that we're in the API economy we

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,850
see a lot of people a lot but we see it

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,710
certainly won't we see API companies

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,749
promoting hey you can do a one-time

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,749
password system easily be our SMS system

00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,119
again fine maybe that's the kind of

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,600
company you are maybe you like those

00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:37,669
kinds of things most of my customers

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,529
want a company at the other end of

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:42,559
throat to choke and it can't always be

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:45,049
bobbing in dev the other thing is secure

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,789
coding is hard there was one post an SMS

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,039
company said okay here's in PHP how you

00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,379
can send an OTP an OTP using our system

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,820
and I didn't even look at you know I

00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,290
don't

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,260
don't know what source of randomness

00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:00,220
they were using I'm not a coder but I

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:04,180
look at it says post HTTP ok first of

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,980
all you've got to at least use SSL so if

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,400
you are you know if you're down with

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,400
that fine but know that secure coding is

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,960
hard and you should think about whose

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,160
throat and choke if anything happens

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,790
alright so now i'm going to start do you

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:28,240
know picking on some pic it on some

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:31,180
things i like openvpn all right open da

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,370
the openvpn is a great product i really

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,260
like it they hope the community versions

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:39,310
awesome the commercial version is all

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,320
summer and reasonably priced it comes

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,350
with certificates right it uses ssl

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,060
instead of zak and so typically what you

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:50,410
would do is you roll out custom shirts

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:55,120
to all your users and use that for

00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:56,970
identification as well as encryption all

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,980
right what's the problem with it

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,510
it's a great way to start if you've got

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,799
a small company you know you don't

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,390
probably wanna have more than 100 users

00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:07,980
on it cuz I think it single-threaded but

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,159
if you're going to grow if you have a

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,990
directory if you have HR how do you tile

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,169
that in who's going to manage those

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:22,260
certificates for you when you know you

00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:24,390
when you have to let someone go so it's

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,659
great but is it the I do you want really

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:41,340
to identity management system let's get

00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:54,390
more even more personal this openvpn

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:56,490
trying to shame the developers so so

00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:00,679
openvpn developers are trying to get

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,679
microsoft to do something via shame

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:10,180
open up an ldap in the means in the

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:16,480
meantime yeah in the meantime we've got

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:18,760
it you know run networks well so SSH we

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,960
all use it all of it it's great but it

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,040
is in fact double the identity

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,510
management if you're using key

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:28,330
management if you're in a compliance

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,830
situation how do you know that you know

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,940
are using the server version that

00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:35,380
requires client press pass phrases are

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,760
you sure your users aren't using a

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,970
client that just says it has a client

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,190
passphrase and can you can you regen

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,080
those keys you know can you do all that

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,090
stuff that you have to do as part of

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,420
that system the other thing again you've

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:51,340
got double identity management systems

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,350
you know I know I've had to fire that

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,390
system in who then came knocking on the

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,630
remote door you know minutes after he

00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,760
walks out the door you know I much

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,940
prefer to have that be a one-stop kill

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,800
button and the way to do that is by a

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,440
time this in through radius and your

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:12,070
directory infrastructure which I'll talk

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,180
about later but obviously you got to

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,890
live with it you just need to think

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,270
about is it really is it really the

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,710
two-factor you want to live with and

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:23,020
grow with google authenticator so there

00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,850
are also you know this is an example of

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,690
a pam module that's been out it works

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:30,250
with google authenticator token you know

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,110
if you're running linux servers and you

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,450
need PCI compliance you might be able to

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,490
get this through it's not a supported

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,530
product it's on google code which i

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:43,360
think i thought they were going to kill

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:44,650
google code but you know again it's it

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,240
to me it's great that they're all these

00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,070
options out there to me it's not

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,010
nestling enterprise kind of solution so

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,110
if it's if it fits your needs great but

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,730
i would be concerned about logging and

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,760
again the throats joke not that i want

00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,020
to check in my throat the most recent

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,480
thing we've seen a lot of is

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,960
authentication as a service which tends

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,310
to be sort of these push apps and so you

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,750
login with the username password and

00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:13,060
then get a request on your smartphone

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,539
saying is this you so they push the

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:20,499
infant

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:23,080
to you again you got electrical you know

00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:24,580
are you getting your logging are you

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,590
getting your you know are you okay with

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,940
that kind of control and I understand

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,379
like I we have customers that are

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,570
literally doing everything moving

00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:34,200
everything into the cloud fortune 500

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,570
manufacturing everything in the cloud

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,249
then when they think about it okay well

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,929
actually we can't have active directory

00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,009
in the cloud and we're still going to

00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:45,759
have a home network so it's going to

00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:48,190
have a VPN so why do we not have our you

00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,999
know or auth server in house and they

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,710
made that decision and now think about

00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:56,139
that same scenarios and you go with an

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,960
authentication as a service provider how

00:26:56,139 --> 00:27:01,119
do you get you all back from the cloud

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,950
well 11 according to one of my customers

00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,679
one of these guys said well we use

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,859
radius and it's and it's encrypted no

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,210
radius is encoded it's not encrypted if

00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,359
someone wants you to radius over the

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,249
internet they're bad people so what do

00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,440
you do well you're going to need a proxy

00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:19,029
so if you do authentication as a service

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,470
what you need is software running at

00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:24,039
home that's a proxy that's that's

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:27,039
running that piece so you know make the

00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,720
call you know we would say just run your

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,399
own server instead of running a piece of

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,759
software that then runs into the talks

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,080
to serve but you know it certainly is a

00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:40,059
very you know it seems to be a very

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,349
popular solution and may fit units all

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,169
right so we need to say we're big fans

00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:48,399
of one-time passwords and we'll dig into

00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:49,659
these a little bit there's a few models

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,970
i don't really cover challenge-response

00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:54,009
models they don't seem to be very

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,769
popular these days it's a lot of extra

00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:59,979
work for the end user so primarily is

00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:02,799
shared secrets the shared secrets come

00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:05,049
in two flavors time-based and counter

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,359
based alright so this Blizzard token is

00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:12,999
a countered based one time you push the

00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:20,570
button you get a new code RSA and you

00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:22,460
know verisign Google all time based so

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,950
one thing that happens with these is

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,330
that you know you got you get your new

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,940
token you mean so if you look I got a

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,769
new pass that each time and meanwhile

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,380
back on the server there's no permanent

00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:36,710
going on right so you have sync issues

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,799
same with clocks right so you know you

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,779
need to have the time is supposed to be

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,539
correct well it doesn't you've got a

00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,279
hardware token so what they do is they

00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,370
allow more than one password to be valid

00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,669
at any given moment all right so you

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,320
sorry that pass codes wrong try again

00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:56,179
try again try again and then the server

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,529
looks for those three pass codes and see

00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,750
if there's a point that they're correct

00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:02,779
in some future or past time and then it

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:05,450
resets your clock so you know as you get

00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:07,250
a six digit number your whatever that is

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,730
one in a million you get down to a much

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,059
smaller space not but it's probably

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,139
going to be a factor in Franklin

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,210
typically also you know in the old days

00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:21,139
with RSA what you have is a pin the pin

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:22,879
the pin the pin append the pin so you'd

00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:24,169
have seven seven eight six six four six

00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:26,200
four five one two three four five six

00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,879
right because that severance pay and

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,220
then strip it a server and you would

00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:32,690
have both factors in that one 12 to do

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,879
not the right possession of the token

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,379
and knowledge of the pin what we see

00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:41,629
more and more that i think is sad is

00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:44,629
username and password and then a prompt

00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:47,019
for the OTP and you know to me that's a

00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:47,019
problem because

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:59,760
really I was thought who sits on the end

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,080
but the question was around the

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,280
statement was that no one even knew

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,540
where the pin went did it go in the

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,430
front but ago in the middle to go in the

00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,430
end I was sending one on the end but

00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:17,880
good okay so that's interesting and part

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,590
of that you know part of the part of the

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,430
mentality there too is that people don't

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,110
we sisson mins have been taught so long

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,850
ntlm you know and you do active

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,320
directory and so all these guys unit

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,390
francisco everything supports active

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,080
directory and radius is kind of an

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,910
afterthought and so every admin thinks

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,860
that to do authorization you need the

00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:42,120
Active Directory password and you do not

00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:44,730
since 2008 when microsoft released IAS

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,280
Malcolm NPS which is their radius plugin

00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,350
you can do authorization based on the

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,410
user name without the password and it

00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,420
will proxy the request away from 88 to

00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,640
your third-party authentication server

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,130
so that's I think that's part of the

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,990
battle is that you know we're dealing

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,220
with a mindset that's been a long time

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:07,860
in the making around active directory

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:12,090
and the problem shared secrets so in

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,560
2011 RSA was attacked by an advanced

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,460
persistent threat no one knows who's it

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,590
is not the dirt you know resulting in

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,180
the basically they went after their see

00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,250
the shared secrets which lowball people

00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:26,540
didn't realize but our essay was keeping

00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,540
those for licensing

00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:40,429
so that's it you know we we obviously in

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:42,770
our early days the statement was that

00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:44,570
RSA lied and said they didn't have those

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:48,160
I don't know about that because I didn't

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,160
sign the NDA to find out what happened

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,490
so our say said they weren't keeping the

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,990
seeds and then you had to pay for them

00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,010
as a service to keep the seeds but in

00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,180
fact they were keeping for everybody

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:08,559
that's a really good business on like

00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:13,770
that so you know coupling is out of this

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:16,240
we we really early on I'm doing on time

00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,190
we never got any business from anyone

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,680
that had RSA right because imagine your

00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,940
security guy and you know goes I would

00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,950
go and I talked to bellsouth and saying

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,440
gether what kind of dates me right and

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,730
the guys would get it is a symmetric

00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,170
encryption that's awesome we all have

00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,250
blackberries that's awesome this is

00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,160
great and they'd be like a we're not

00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,900
doing it because we could save the

00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,120
company millions of dollars that guy

00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:40,480
stole none of it we get they get hacked

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,540
he's fired it's a very asymmetric kind

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,450
of thought process there it with the

00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:49,960
Great Recession that changes right so we

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:53,260
go from being greenfield pci 20 in fact

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,790
we need to cut our budget by a million

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,410
dollars and it's either you know Bob and

00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,960
Ted go away or we squeeze the vendors

00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,059
and so we saw a lot more of that from

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,280
RSA no one is like no one's like okay

00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,050
well you used asymmetric encryption so

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,650
that's better everyone's like we don't

00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,940
like the way our say treated us if you

00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,280
weren't you know basically if you were

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,510
big enough the vice president of golf

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,550
and dining came and told you what

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,900
happened got you to sign an NDA told you

00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:21,790
what happened if you weren't big enough

00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:24,880
you got so what we do is a request

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:27,190
response system it's a symmetric keys

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,450
when the user wants to log in the pin is

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:35,110
encrypted by the private key on the

00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:38,500
token sent to the server decrypted by

00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,850
the public key if the Crimson's valid

00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,530
the accounts act and the pin is correct

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,179
the OTP is encrypted by the private key

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,380
of a server returned decrypted by the

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,000
public key of the server on the token

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,710
presented to the user so there's no

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,280
there's no clock drift there's no

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,360
whatever slightly different model it's a

00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,040
little bit similar to challenge response

00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,040
but a little bit easier on the end user

00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,750
before i get there the reason in the

00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,670
reason why i like OTPs is because they

00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,389
work everywhere right any place where

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,549
the UI is pretty much handled because

00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:08,569
everyone everything uses a password then

00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,760
what you really need to do is just

00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:14,019
figure out the back end and so now we're

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,019
gonna talk a little about the back end

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,990
what we recommend and we don't always

00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:21,220
see this but what we recommend is you

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:25,429
don't use passwords outside of the land

00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:28,220
use radius and tie in your directory we

00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,720
support ldap and tak acts as well but

00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,220
radius is the only thing that will do

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,169
authorization in your directory and then

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:38,409
proxy the crabs elsewhere we're

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:43,730
obviously our server is looking for a

00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:46,970
six digit number so we throw a log entry

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,399
if it's a non-numeric passcode we don't

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,960
ding the bad passcode attempts for the

00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,869
user because if something you got a

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,980
username you know route Smith he's

00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,420
quickly going to get tossed but to me

00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,710
it's interesting that it you know

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,809
there's two scenarios one you're just

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,730
getting you know someone's just guessing

00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,170
to is it someone's actually is guessing

00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,910
with a valid password but using in the

00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,769
wrong way right so in that scenario

00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,720
you've got someone who's been fished or

00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:12,980
his credentials have been stolen maybe

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,920
it's maybe it's just a user doesn't know

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,180
he's doing but perhaps perhaps that's

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,990
been compromised and something's going

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,529
on your network that you should

00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:23,359
investigate again if you're doing pci

00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:24,410
you already doing this but servers and

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,660
critical infrastructures you should

00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,369
treat as external so this is where we

00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,519
see tack act sometimes where you want

00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:34,369
command level control over your switch

00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,960
infrastructure but we see that very

00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:40,220
rarely most people still use radius

00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,720
alright so you know the old days what it

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,630
looked like or you had a VPN and you all

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,390
your users were in there then you know

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:49,339
there's the battle for the directory

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:55,279
novell loses Microsoft wins and then we

00:35:49,339 --> 00:36:01,460
all use openldap maybe but and then in

00:35:55,279 --> 00:36:03,079
2008 again Microsoft allows proxy so in

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,329
the end you've always been able to with

00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,740
it with free radisson openldap it is so

00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,259
easy to do in for your email that you

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,440
just add like dial-up access yes to a

00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:14,690
couple of places and it's done NPS is a

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,819
nightmare one of our most popular

00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,020
documents azhar how to do two factor

00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:20,300
authentication for NPS

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,800
it's because you know otherwise it's a

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,760
tech done for Microsoft that's like 60

00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:29,780
pages long but you get a lot of benefits

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,960
out of this your directory admins

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,340
whether it's you HR whoever can disable

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,770
a user and lock them out of the process

00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,510
completely they do not have to have

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:43,160
administrator rights on your two-factor

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:44,990
off the server you can also do knack at

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,060
that one so if you're looking at like

00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,650
verizon recommends doing to making sure

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,150
your abs up to date doing your malware

00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,420
detection you can do it before these

00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:58,010
people get on the network invicta

00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:02,780
varying degrees of pain you know i would

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:08,270
say next not quite here but a lot of

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:13,400
people are doing it all right so what

00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:15,110
time do I have to end okay good so lots

00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,090
of benefits from this including the fact

00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:20,600
that you now have potentially you know

00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:23,540
multi-os you know a lot of our customers

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,490
it's a it's a linux box running wicked

00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm sorry you know whatever Cisco

00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:31,820
running essentially whatever bsd pfsense

00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,400
whatever firewall talking to windows

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,720
talking to a linux server which is

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,610
pretty cool and you can do all that with

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,680
radius and the other thing about radius

00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,620
is it can be very simple right it's IP

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,210
address shared secret and a timeout and

00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,700
that's all you need to do to get it up

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,960
and running and then you can get as

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,380
complex as you want to with return

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,880
attributes all right so now a couple of

00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,310
tricks to rule the world right once you

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,140
have this setup the first is that any

00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,910
web app you have if you confront it with

00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,310
a passion you can add radius to it and

00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:04,100
it's pretty easy rights mod auth radius

00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,990
model x radius we've got a couple of how

00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,920
to got a few how to's on this on how to

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:12,650
forge and on our website and so if you

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,450
are looking at you know everybody's got

00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,180
web apps now some customer facing some

00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,800
employee facing some vendor facing if

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,190
you can put to that if you can put

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,280
something in front of it

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,410
all your CMS systems all sport HTTP

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:32,280
authentication so put a patchy in front

00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:35,720
of it and do radius linux servers Pam

00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,910
radius you know beyond the sort of

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,500
oddness of Pam combined the oddness of

00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,010
Pam with the oddness of the freeradius

00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,410
guy but it actually works and it works

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,930
pretty well and so you can add two

00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,359
factor auth to anything that runs that

00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:55,890
sports Pam so that's SSH that's openvpn

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:59,579
I once set up a XMPP chat server that

00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:01,050
could use two-factor the interesting

00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:04,020
thing here I think is you can do sue do

00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,440
write or log in anything like that you

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,859
can you can have it used two factor auth

00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:13,619
so one of the one of the things I

00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:16,319
recommend is go in and add two factor so

00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,940
one you can set min ssh gateway so log

00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,339
into the gateway with two factor off the

00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:24,720
radius and then use your ssh keys out so

00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:27,480
you kind of has ssssh SSO obviously you

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,859
want to lock down that server a gateway

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,849
server but we see a lot of people doing

00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:34,619
that lockdown sue do with two factor

00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:36,569
auth maybe lockdown suited with two

00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:38,430
factor auth for like a week and then

00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:39,510
just see what breaks it's like that old

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,040
adage like how do you want to know what

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,190
firewall rules you need drop them all

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,250
and see see who calls first you know

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,619
drop sudu and see what's using sudo that

00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,270
should be because one of the things you

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:54,240
want to know is hey what's running on my

00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,020
network already along that lines I was

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,490
talking with someone of b-sides

00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,859
Asheville employees like well you should

00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:01,650
do to factor all four egrants you know

00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:02,880
set up your proxy and make sure they log

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,730
in with two factor off before they get

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,530
outbound what's what what breaks and

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,750
what is dialing out that shouldn't be

00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,220
dialing out on your yeah that's really

00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,220
valuable information yes

00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,640
yeah it does but is that but is that but

00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:25,930
is what is that broken oh I'm sorry the

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,410
question is isn't the point of using

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,400
sudo that attracts that yes and if but

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:36,760
if you're an attacker that's what you

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:39,609
would break that long first again I'm

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,170
just you know to me it's just like so

00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:42,190
and I've got I do have some customers

00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,750
are coming in they and they've taken

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,920
over a network and they've taken over a

00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,720
wicked server and we're walking through

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,940
them and having them set up their test

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,609
lab and does stuff and some are like you

00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,810
know what I got to own this this is

00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:56,829
going to be much you know it's like

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:58,420
going to my network and so what I'm you

00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,619
know you want to have some tricks out

00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,619
there you can find out what's running on

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,520
so the next recommendation is

00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:08,170
segmentation and if you're doing if you

00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,550
are PCI compliant you've done this right

00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,260
so you've got some credit card

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:15,849
processing piece that is segmented out

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,170
because what the verizon found out was

00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:20,349
that most networks are really really

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,690
flat and so it's easy to go from HR to

00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:28,329
finance to you know marketing to

00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:31,530
accounting and and that's you know it

00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:34,599
doesn't it doesn't stop the attacker

00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:37,119
what we've seen is particular for PCI

00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,030
compliance SSH jump box we had one

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,349
customer that had a their work their

00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,520
credit card processing systems run

00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:47,079
windows and so yeah so what they did is

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,089
they locked him down and they put up

00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,940
free NX is anyone from them with free

00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:58,180
and X from no machine was removed by no

00:41:51,940 --> 00:42:02,079
machine but it's a NX does rdp VNC

00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:04,000
desktop sharing remote x all tunnel

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,750
through ssh using pam for authentication

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,780
and it's incredibly fast it is way much

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:15,369
more easy to setup than VNC through ssh

00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:17,440
and way faster so we're big fans of that

00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:20,710
and so basically they've got a linux box

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,990
with two factor auth ssh tunnels to log

00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:26,370
into the NC to their windows machine

00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,200
excellent excellent segment they

00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,270
eventually replace that when they got

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,830
like a juniper box which would do the

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,310
network segmenting they need and lock it

00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:36,840
down that way again monitoring for the

00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:51,420
password is not a number you know

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:53,490
particularly our question boy that's a

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,410
good question i don't know i don't

00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,090
really look to that because i was thank

00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,470
you how would you how would you do this

00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,420
how would you do this with a container

00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,950
such as doc oh I haven't really looked

00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,300
at that much you know there was a little

00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,190
bit of a conversation on Twitter the

00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,250
other day about like so doctor basically

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,200
compared to vmware we're vmware you

00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,660
attack the hypervisor with docker you

00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,940
can attack the whole kernel didn't

00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,320
really get much into that I don't know

00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,880
man you that's tough I think you'd have

00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,920
to lock down the server it's running on

00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,340
and each docker instance but I won't lay

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,790
know there's a docker talk tomorrow that

00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,790
I want to go to

00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:44,120
so so that so that the response is that

00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,370
doctors not ready for prime time but

00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,840
there's but that's kinda if you look at

00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:53,930
the you know the wave of you know

00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:57,950
security because it's it's just it's the

00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:00,290
hype cycle right so and Java is Java is

00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,420
coming over the curb now I think we're

00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,590
all those attacks have all been patched

00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,260
I mean you don't want to run in your

00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,850
browser but in so it comes through

00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,980
Microsoft's the same way Microsoft

00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:13,100
invested a lot in security and their

00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,840
lifecycle development piece and hired

00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,840
some really respected names and actually

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,580
gave them clout and you know Microsoft

00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,350
is a lot you know the windows is a lot

00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,990
more secure than it once was and so

00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:25,730
doctor is really early in that life

00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,440
cycle I think that's a valid point that

00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:33,920
would be very I'd be very careful

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:35,900
running a production so again looking

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,580
for the valid use of improper use of

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:45,020
valid credentials and outbound

00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:46,190
monitoring about that for darker how

00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,600
does this look if you segment your

00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,720
network and you use radius it looks

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,330
exactly the same so to me this is a huge

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,260
benefit because you know and imagine

00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,030
you're coming in you're taking over

00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,310
network and not everything looks the

00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,170
same you that's that's it's the most

00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,640
worrisome thing you can imagine which

00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,920
really what you want is you know if

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,330
everything is talking radius it's all

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,710
going through your directory and it's

00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,150
all talking to your auth server we're

00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,270
all servers because you can do it that

00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:14,990
way to you know that makes mix me a lot

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:16,490
more comfortable it also thanks to

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,950
radius it's very easy to swap out those

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:21,170
parts I mean it's never hard to swap out

00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:24,290
a directory but you can easily go from

00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,420
pfsense box to a cisco to a Juniper as

00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:28,430
your scalability requires you can easily

00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,840
swap out wicked for whatever to factor

00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:35,890
all the system you want because they all

00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:35,890
smart radius so

00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:43,980
yeah anyway the benefits monitor better

00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,210
monitoring you definitely on a segment

00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,400
you want to stop that lateral movement

00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:51,070
and you know when you think about it it

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,570
is you know what are they after they're

00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,550
after everything you know there's value

00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,600
in HR there's value in marketing there's

00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:00,580
value and just shutting down your

00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:01,960
network so there's really there's really

00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,320
nothing you probably shouldn't segment

00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,620
in some way what do you get if you love

00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,390
stuff lockdown remote access which gets

00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:15,640
you you know bad passcode you know you

00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:17,500
get that kind of security controls

00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,450
around bad password attempts bad pin

00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,880
code attempts you're sure there's a

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,440
lockdown which is where your data is

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,080
brute force protection that are

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,690
monitoring but mainly you're forcing the

00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,800
attackers to change plans and so you

00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,800
know either you're making them go

00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,930
somewhere else or you're increasing the

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,410
likelihood of detection and that's

00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:40,570
that's what it's all about all your

00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,460
services look the same so it's pretty

00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:44,080
easy everything is talking radius and

00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,160
then it's a question of like oh you so

00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,620
you want to write a new content

00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,960
management system does it support radius

00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,940
just to support HTTP off if so yes then

00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,440
it's in the box we get a lot of

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,720
questions like oh do you work with check

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,010
one do you work with Cisco really the

00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:02,430
question should be do you support or

00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:06,180
authentication standard and yes we did

00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:08,920
hopefully less password use you know

00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,880
when we started a long time ago we're

00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,350
like people are going to stick of

00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,180
passwords their Tukes they're more

00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:15,850
expensive than you think now it's at

00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,380
this stage where you have to have I'm

00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,720
everyone seen the jokes about needing a

00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:21,100
hieroglyph and a capital letter and you

00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,780
know your mother's maiden name all in

00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:26,200
the password it's really kind of

00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:29,710
becoming like that and it's kind of

00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,210
satin so we recommend you really look at

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,670
getting rid of passwords as much as

00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,200
possible in that vein if you are looking

00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,670
rolling out to factor off you should buy

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,670
a look at doing some form of single sign

00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:42,400
on as well and try and reduce the number

00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,660
of authentication points

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,520
there is some interesting stuff going on

00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:52,510
in that realm we currently support sam'l

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:57,460
for google but we're also looking at

00:47:52,510 --> 00:48:01,790
open ID connect as well as JSON web

00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,220
tokens or shots as they're called open

00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:09,050
ID connect is sort of the bastard

00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:11,839
stepchild of Roth and open ID but may

00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:15,890
actually have some it's kind of the best

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:20,330
of both of them and seems to have some

00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:21,500
interesting legs jocks are kind of

00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:25,910
interesting because it's basically it's

00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:29,030
a JSON no encoded message saying trust

00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,320
this don't trust this and it seems to be

00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,990
one of those things that have swelled up

00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:37,280
from developers rather than push down by

00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:41,869
vendors so then we may actually be on

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,640
the verge of usable SSO that's it for me

00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:45,260
I've got probably about 10 minutes for

00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,050
questions everyone should enjoy the

00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:52,550
conference I hope so and if you need to

00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:56,800
get me here's my information provide oh

00:48:52,550 --> 00:49:01,570
so Fido is the my opinion on Fido is the

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:04,570
sustained for fast internet of something

00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,570
so

00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:09,670
so I have another my other type of talk

00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,949
recently on the history of two factor

00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,449
authentication and ended I talked about

00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,509
the Liberty Alliance which started in

00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:21,309
2001 right it was backed by google

00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:25,959
microsoft paypal and others the was the

00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:27,400
other one Liberty Alliance oasis which

00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:30,959
started sam'l which is backed by

00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:34,779
Microsoft Google paypal and others and

00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:37,539
open ID back by google microsoft paypal

00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:39,099
and others and now there's 50 is backed

00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:40,989
by google microsoft paypal and others

00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:43,089
you go to Liberty alliance org and it's

00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:48,789
like 40 for images on all their logos

00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:50,920
the so radius is a great standard

00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:54,130
freeradius is awesome the community is

00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,719
awesome when heartbleed hit you saw them

00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:00,219
work on the patches and work through it

00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:04,569
it's a robust 3 Otto server based on an

00:50:00,219 --> 00:50:07,329
open standard my toe to me is a vendor

00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:09,099
knock knock labs that is said ok we want

00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:12,670
to be big in this space so let's start a

00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:14,920
standard maybe that'll be great maybe

00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,479
we'll implement it but I'm not rushing

00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,709
to that I sort of think that if the

00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:23,380
users demand it then W to me the issue

00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:26,529
isn't so much like you know we could

00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,269
support google in our coke and you could

00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:31,059
have one token that did your google and

00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:33,039
wicked you know in a way that's just

00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:37,179
sort of you still have the key chain is

00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,920
small because it's on your device in

00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:41,679
meat to me the important standard is

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,619
around SS 0 and radius and if you can

00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:48,699
get a good SSO standard that actually

00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:49,929
works for customers then that's more

00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:55,449
important than a standard way to

00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:58,319
implement the two factor auth limit i'm

00:50:55,449 --> 00:51:01,840
a little am a little jaded by the whole

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:11,030
liberty alliance open ID foundation

00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:13,940
you know any other questions did anybody

00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:18,260
see the breach this week by what was it

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:23,660
called a code hosting company code bits

00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:27,410
code partners code base what code spaces

00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:31,610
yet so code spaces Scott they got addy

00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:33,680
Doss first and then went to go and you

00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:36,230
know back up their customer data on

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,780
amazon or start changing their amazon

00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,190
credentials and the people already had

00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,810
control of the credentials saw them

00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:45,440
trying to get it back and wiped out all

00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:49,160
of their stuff so one of the things I

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,470
think it's this is a bit a long time

00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:55,820
coming but all this growth in

00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:57,140
cloud-based services where is same with

00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:00,860
Google Apps if you didn't Google Apps

00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:02,360
you know you really need to do sam'l two

00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,590
reasons one is that you can use their

00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,090
Google Authenticator but if something

00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,180
goes wrong here you call in customer

00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:09,230
support it's just kind of the weak point

00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:14,710
scene with amazon they may have better

00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:14,710
customer support but I have my doubts ok

00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:21,560
ok so now Amazon is paid for escalation

00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:24,080
before it happens whereas with sambal

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,130
you know and I have screwed up my sample

00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,990
interface and been locked out of my

00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,550
google apps test accounts because I've

00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,830
uploaded the wrong keys yeah they're

00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:33,530
good and but you know at that point you

00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,450
still own the you know you own the users

00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,490
and you can control them and reenable

00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,170
users and stuff like that there is a

00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,300
site after alpha after all this mat

00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,620
Honan kind of hoopla and everyone wanted

00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:46,610
two factor auth there's a site now call

00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:48,140
to faster to factor org which is kind of

00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:51,110
a name and shame slight and basically

00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:54,320
it's every web service do what forms a

00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:56,390
two factor auth do they support and you

00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,210
know and if they don't have it ask them

00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,650
if they're getting it Thank thing and I

00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,780
you know wicked is up there as a

00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:06,230
provider and sometimes like well what

00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,670
about you know Samuel what about other

00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,720
again because really what you want is

00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,370
these service if you're an enterprise

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,440
you want that you want to know what kind

00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:15,200
of SSO standards is these guys support

00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,180
and you know they decided wasn't really

00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,620
in their purview but to me this is one

00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:21,260
of the things i think about is so the

00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:23,540
next research project is what what SSO

00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,940
standards they support how do you do you

00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,130
know what's the customer support in

00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,200
terms of the event and escalation if you

00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,700
get locked out what happens because i

00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,500
was locked out of a google apps nap just

00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,540
got a lot of six months that's just like

00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,370
okay well let's just wait until they

00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:43,870
email me back and i'll move on to create

00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:46,310
another account basically anything else

00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,870
alright enjoy the conference I've got a

00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,220
I'll be here I've got a table right

00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,870
around the corner so if you have any

00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:56,500
questions you too shy to ask in front of

00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:59,240
this robust crowd come and see me thank

00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,770
your customers rely on your website or

00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,140
application if it's slower

00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:06,080
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,910
and costs you money keeping your

00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,360
business critical systems humming along

00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:13,730
requires insight into what they're doing

00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,680
your system metrics tells stories

00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,690
stories that can reveal performance

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,030
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:21,590
other problems but how do you keep an

00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:24,230
eye on all of your systems performance

00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:27,290
metrics in real-time and record this

00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:29,030
data for later analysis enter longview

00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:31,040
the new way to see what's really going

00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,200
on under the hood the long view

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,270
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,730
of all your systems providing you with a

00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:41,090
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:43,670
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:45,440
load and network usage click a specific

00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,840
system to access its individual

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,350
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,760
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,440
comprehensive network data including

00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,750
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,310
available on the network tab and disk

00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,230
rights and free space on the disk

00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:03,080
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:05,600
displays usage statistics for individual

00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,760
processes the system info tab shows

00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,010
listening services active connections

00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,140
and available updates adding long view

00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,850
to a system is easy just click the

00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,980
button copy the one line installation

00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,440
command then run the command on your

00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,120
linux system to complete the process the

00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,310
agent will begin collecting data and

00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,140
sending it to longview then the graph

00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:26,720
start rolling

00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:29,090
used longview to gain visibility into

00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,830
your servers so when your website or app

00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,830
