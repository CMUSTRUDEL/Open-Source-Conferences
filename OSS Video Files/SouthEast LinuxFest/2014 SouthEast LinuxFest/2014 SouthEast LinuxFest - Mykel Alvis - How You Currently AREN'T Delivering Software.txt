the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

pc org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,430
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,990
videos possible like like and i don't

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,240
mean rights offer for living I mean

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,529
you're not a system administrator who

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,480
writes software you write actual

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,190
software for a living how many people

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,670
who do not write software for a living

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,260
you're a system administrator yeah okay

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,450
so I should probably just go ahead and

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,739
divide you into these two camps if I had

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:50,340
any sense i probably would go ahead and

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:52,980
do that but I was okay the the primary

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,780
target for everything I speak is those

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:03,600
two groups of people but they are

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:05,280
usually I am typically more I've been a

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,500
software developer since i was about 12

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:16,200
and so this is year 35 for me and i am

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:21,720
typically strangely more it's the word

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:24,420
I'm looking for sympathetic to the

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,310
operational side of things because I had

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,080
this kind of Epiphany a few years ago

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,390
where I realized what a giant I

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,229
had been for about 20 years well I was

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,909
writing software so when you through the

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,500
course of this I'm going to probably use

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,270
a bunch of bad words and probably say

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,890
some mean things and they are almost

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,509
certainly directed at somebody in this

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,549
room or somebody that you know and

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,850
you're perfectly welcome to take those

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,939
personally or not it has been a little

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,920
over five years since I beat anybody up

00:01:49,939 --> 00:02:00,420
actually five years five months five

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,799
years five months and 20 days so take

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,600
your best shot I will stand there and

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,540
you can you're welcome to stomp the crap

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,510
out of me

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,320
I have become a complete pacifist so I

00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:14,320
promise but if you do get your feelings

00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,720
hurt that's probably for a pretty good

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,990
reason probably I said something that

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,760
you went hey and I do that a lot I do I

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,470
say mean things about people an awful

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,670
lot of the time I am a consultant that's

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,590
what I they pay me to do that so I am I

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,440
am perfectly willing to hear your stupid

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,790
side of the story and if you want to

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,190
tell me your stupid side of this or a

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,850
well I'll listen oh my god I mean I'm

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:43,120
here all weekend so I am I really come

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:46,510
to these things because I'm not a open

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,650
source sky I am I do our work in open

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,840
source all the time but I'm not really

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,310
an open source guy i'm not i am a linux

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,650
guy but i actually come to these things

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,630
to meet people to make sure that I don't

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,110
get lost in the corporate that

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,660
I spend my days in all the time so if

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:06,070
somebody has a better example if you

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:08,920
have good data if you have things where

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,780
you know that I am patently wrong that's

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,640
fine i'm interested in hearing that i am

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:18,040
not a i am a bit of a egotist i do think

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,930
i'm right about basically everything but

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,489
i am also a bit of a scientist if you

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,730
prove me wrong i am totally willing to

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,610
take your story so until you have better

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:31,739
data than I have I'm right but I'm

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,570
willing to listen to your data so

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,260
without further ado it is past time

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,910
let's go see if I might be able to do

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,470
this by driving it on I have the

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,870
microsoft blue mouse if you don't have

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,340
this you're not as cool as me this mouse

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,070
turns off by turning it straight up this

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,790
is an awesome mouse but it is hard to

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:56,769
drive so I am great and powerful I am oz

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,530
actually i'm not i'm michael Alvis I am

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,980
a DevOps consultant that is what I do

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:08,170
for a living and that mouth thing is to

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:10,870
in Oregon also it's not anywhere real I

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,970
am a DevOps consultant I am probably not

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,230
a shape-shifting mind-controlling lizard

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,549
man if you don't know what that means

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,590
you should really look up the link to

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,070
this when when you see this thing

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,990
because that

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:25,360
is a really awesome set of nutjobs on

00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:26,800
the internet I am in fact lawful evil of

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,170
neutral tendencies I'm a complete

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,310
control freak I am willing to let you go

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,720
and do your thing if you don't know it

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,010
lawfully sore as hell you doing in this

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,600
room anyway but the but i am i'm a bit

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,860
of a control freak that's how i got into

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,210
dev ops in the first place that's

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,860
actually how I got into everything in

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,840
the first place that's how people get

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,670
into software we're control freaks we

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,530
have this they have this idea of a thing

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,930
we want and we have this magical space

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,280
we can build it in and really there's no

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,040
law there are really no laws of physics

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,630
when you're writing software that's why

00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,550
operational people have such a hard time

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,080
the purely operational people have a

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,850
hard time dealing with pure developers

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,190
because operational people do live in

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,800
the real world and developers kind of

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,000
don't I have spent years decades being

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,220
one of those guys is like yeah I could

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,330
do that or whatever what do you mean

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,710
what do you mean does it how does have

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,660
to run on I don't care somebody will

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,160
build something to go run on yeah that's

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,770
like a really kind of bad way to live

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,520
your life um this is my twitter handle

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,360
that is my blog it is in frequently

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,580
updated i'm not really a twitter guy so

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,830
the but the blog actually is i have like

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,120
60 posts that are pending right now

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,340
because i'm supposed to be feeding these

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,280
things to some folks in india so that's

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,170
actually likely going to be going to

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,510
pick up the pace a bit this is you

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,680
you're the nitpicker I'm the armpit

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,270
scratcher you're the vapor I'm actually

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,620
likely to scratch my armpits across the

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,660
weekend if you catch me doing that i

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,220
will give you a dollar if you actually

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,620
catch me scratching my armpits because i

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,070
have i have decided that every now and

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm like I'm like and I decided no more

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,180
if you catch me scratching my armpits

00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,320
over the weekend I'll give you a buck

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,890
you probably work and developer

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,180
developer or operational staff you are

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,490
you're probably not under worked if

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,900
you're in software the chances are

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,220
excellent if you get if you do this for

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,260
a living you're probably not under

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,330
worked you might be capacity worked you

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,770
might do your 40 hours and be okay but

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,780
if you actually work in these in these

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,290
industries you probably aren't leading

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,240
on time I leave on time because I am

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,680
only allowed to Bill 40 hours to my

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,180
client but then I go back to my hotel

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,380
room and I work for my company so it's

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,660
really not the same thing as leaving on

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,490
time chances are excellent you are

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,320
failing that you will at least not

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,360
succeeding

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,830
and that's a really that's really

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,330
painful thing for most people because

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,800
they really kind of want to do their job

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,240
where they like to feel they're in

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,920
control of things and you are probably

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,870
not getting the feeling mature and

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,780
control of stuff we have been in

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,000
software for some like a little over 60

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,220
years now it is existed as a more or

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,580
less real concept for a little longer

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,960
than I've been alive but for the truth

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,790
of the matter is we're not really a

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,130
whole lot better at producing it now

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,190
than we were even 30 40 years ago

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,930
because we have expanded the scope of

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,180
what we're working in and we didn't

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,880
really turn it into what I would

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,140
consider a real engineering discipline

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,400
I'll talk more about that later actually

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,770
I'll just more about that later

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,870
but the real result of all this is

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,360
you're probably not happy you are almost

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,570
certainly not happy software people

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,330
aren't generally happy people we are

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,730
content we tend to be like yeah we did

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,920
okay oh yeah that delivery went out with

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,320
only you know five hours of overtime

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,640
yeah I only had to stay up until 3am

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,410
twice last year yeah no big deal but we

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,140
are not we tend to be content without

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,150
being happy it is just not really in

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,610
your nature if you are constantly

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,190
looking for making something even just a

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,870
little bit better all the time

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,060
satisfaction is the best you typically

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,040
get now I could be projecting myself on

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,710
there i'm i am a little i'm a little

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,660
weird but i think that i see this enough

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,300
in other people that i'm not wrong I

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,700
work with a hole that I've worked last

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,010
year I worked with about 10,000 people

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,230
over all across the country i worked

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,850
with about 10,000 people now i did not

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,530
work directly with 10,000 people that

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,040
would be like that's like a rock concert

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,900
but i saw all these people and they all

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,420
had the same expression that you all

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:24,780
have right now which is uh huh uh huh

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:26,760
whatever uh-huh yeah no I mean they it's

00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,350
not like they lack emotion they just

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,990
don't they're not there they're they

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,729
really aren't um they're just not super

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,070
happy about everything that they're

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,510
doing and we have we've gotten in

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,750
ourselves into this place because we

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,610
can't really deliver software nobody can

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,010
if you can find me a place where people

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:48,170
really deliver software that

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:51,060
not have etsy com as its primary domain

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:54,210
where they're really super frigging good

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,800
at it then I I'm really interested in

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,940
seeing that if you work for this place

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,710
you need to tell me where this is

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,430
because I at least need to go see it

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,900
happen now that part of the the people

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,270
that I'm talking about are not people

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,160
who write you know 600 line shell

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,030
scripts and upload them to the Internet

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,980
they're not people who write you know

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,750
2,000 line javed libraries that get

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,340
stuck into the maven repository I'm

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,100
going by people who write large-scale

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,770
systems things that really do stuff

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,320
right the deliver real value to somebody

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,900
probably where you make some money I i

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,870
really love open source software but

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,000
nobody really gets paid fat cash to be

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,280
an open-source gun does anybody in here

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,290
get paid fat cash or even a living wage

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,740
to be a purely open-source developer

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,850
yeah so I thought I I'm always wondering

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,810
it's like yeah this is going to be the

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,140
time where there's like one of those

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,960
 in here and so we're talking

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,730
about delivering software and we're not

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,530
talking about pizza but we're talking

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,490
about something that works a little bit

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:59,430
like pizza because Domino's as I was so

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,160
rudely told last year no longer has a 30

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,420
minute guarantee for their delivery but

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,310
they have something better now is

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,560
anybody had delivered I ordered pizza

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,840
from domino's online in the last mount a

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,490
little while I I was in the hospital I

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,130
was literally the only thing they've

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,590
delivered to me in the hospital but now

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,090
they have this thing remember do you see

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,760
what did you see this is unbelievable

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,010
they have a web page that dynamically

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,290
updates as to where your damn pizza is

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:30,540
in the oven oh and who's cooking it they

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,580
know who put your crammed together they

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,890
know who put your you're really shitty

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,660
pile of carbohydrate and fat into the

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,400
end of the bowl and shoved it through

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,960
the oven and they know the guy who's

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,670
delivering it to you like okay if you

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,120
put that into software people would call

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,790
you a God not the part where you can see

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,420
it but the part where you could say yeah

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,860
it's happening

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,860
net that would be amazing well we don't

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,720
do that whatever but we're talking about

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,459
doing something that gets stuff into the

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,680
hands of your consumer whoever that

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,480
consumer is sometimes your consumer is

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,730
another piece of software and sometimes

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,399
your consumer is a is a dude where dude

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,730
is an on gender nonspecific term but

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,699
it's somebody who's actually involved in

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,529
using your stuff getting that getting

00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:22,690
your software into the hands of a user

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:25,060
is what was the thing I'm talking about

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,740
when I talk about delivery now the

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,779
chances are good the problem all started

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,290
when you did not design correctly you

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:35,350
have you had it's supposed to be

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,959
engineering dude it's but you know it's

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,149
a lot more like farming you know a oh

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,160
yeah I got this thing as you know I well

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,800
I got this one little piece of something

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,970
and I well and then I then I bolted this

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,790
other thing on the side of it and it's

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,050
like well then it's like well you know

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,329
what we're just going to sit out and see

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,160
what you grow somebody to come on like a

00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,750
okay bolt some more stuff on the side

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,269
both a little more stuff on the side and

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,010
it turns into it into more like farming

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:04,420
than engineering because it's really

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:06,550
sort of like plant and pray you know is

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,180
anybody for people who I grew up in

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,920
farming company i grew up alabama and we

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,410
had you know you planted stuff in the

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,459
ground but you just expected about well

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:20,380
half of it not to come up this is what I

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,630
mean you justyou plan for that kind of

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,430
failure now in software we kind of the

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,990
new the new the hot new thing is kind of

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,040
planning for failure to but it's

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,079
planning for fell here in a different

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,050
way this is planning for failure like

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,490
it's thus this it's like the most um

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,199
it's the most fatalistic version of

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,810
writing software it's like well this is

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,190
never going to work anybody ever worked

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,420
in that place this is never going to

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,930
work they just gave us some new

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,329
requirements is never going to work yeah

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,680
has anybody said that lately I said it

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,949
last week by the way I just in case

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,649
nobody read I was I was that guy um so

00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:55,660
fifty percent sucks fifty percent

00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,490
success in anything just I mean you

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,290
still fail in college if you have a

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,170
50-percent well unless you got to go to

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,819
a weird school I guess um the next part

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,089
of it is when you when you have bad

00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,129
design when you don't

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,740
have a good place to hang all your stuff

00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:13,519
on then you have probably some bad code

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,649
now good delivery is is very dependent

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,559
is frequently dependent on good

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,959
automation and I mean that at every

00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,149
level does anybody I'd say if people can

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,189
write software do you write unit tests

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:28,160
and the answer can be no I don't give

00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:33,079
 but if you write unit tests do you

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,550
run those unit tests by hand ever no

00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,290
because that's stupid why would you do

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,699
that that's why you have freaking unit

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,069
test frameworks in the first place you

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,930
have a thing that automates the running

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,420
of your unit test well that's aight like

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,550
this level right or maybe it's look at

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,740
this level i'm talking about all the way

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,129
up automation through the course of

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:56,120
coding building your software for the

00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:58,999
idea of automation is essential to

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,430
delivery it is not oh like well we if we

00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:03,829
don't do that we can still do you no

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,199
good solid repeatable reliable delivery

00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:09,829
no you can't that's just I have

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:13,220
been I have been in 25 major companies

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:15,620
in the last 15 years 12 years something

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,100
I don't know some amount of time and I

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,620
have never ever ever seen somebody who

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,470
could come along behind their kind of

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,059
crappy build their stupid code that was

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,610
really never meant to be automated it

00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:31,040
was been to be done by a dude that you

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,269
gave you know reams of information about

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
like oh here's when you when you want to

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,600
build this here's what you got to do

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,579
you're gonna get a hold you you want it

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,120
you want to hold your head in this one

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:43,999
no no oh oh oh hold on you did it all

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,399
wrong that crazy stuff that people want

00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:49,639
you to do to get your to get your code

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,009
even built to write the code it's it's

00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,009
got to be done you have to consider the

00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:56,300
unit test as the base concept but you

00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,790
also have to think about things like

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,949
package management package managers are

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:05,470
another form human fear has dropped

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:08,480
actual live bits on a Linux box lately

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,269
real like like I copied if I go here's

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,670
here's the source I compile this you

00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,709
know or Dutton shared library and I

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,030
copied that shared library didn't you

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,700
feel dirty after because you should have

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,740
because the the concept of package

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,080
management is simply automation for this

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,850
stupid task that you have to do over and

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,700
over again that you will if you had to

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,200
do that every day you would fail about

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,030
ten percent of the time not because

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,950
you're stupid or because you're you know

00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,340
pathetic at your job it's because you're

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,440
human you're terrible at stuff I'm I

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,390
talked last year at opensuse was

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,790
basically people suck at everything and

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,920
they do I actually know a bunch of

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,990
magicians who have been been pounding

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,520
this into my head for years now they're

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:56,280
like I can make you believe anything

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:58,410
like I know I'm actually I actually

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,900
think I'm a pretty smart guy yeah you

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,580
got me I mean that that's sort of thing

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,320
you're just terrible at this repetition

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,410
behavior all you're really good at

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,090
really is recognizing kind of patterns

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,190
and then trying to go back through and

00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,230
iterate over those patterns that's why

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,400
nobody ever shows you a magic trick over

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,680
and over again because eventually you're

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,840
gonna be like oh if they're it as well

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,490
you put that humble that's gross but I

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,320
mean that that sort of thing is what

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,610
you're good at you're good at kind of

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,880
what what what what what huh Oh got it

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:34,710
and then you move on to the next thing

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:37,050
so click Nana your code is probably not

00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,270
written with automation in mind because

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,150
if you're a code guy you're like that's

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,190
somebody else's job there and it's the

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:46,590
sila right so look here's the co here's

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,630
the code guys silo or the delimiter

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,690
here's the that's somebody else's

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,120
problem that side silo I'll just pass it

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,530
off to him you did not write your code

00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,810
to be automated because you have to do

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,950
more extra unpleasant work to make code

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,420
that is good that is easily automatable

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,570
your code was actually probably only

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,270
written to accomplish what I like to

00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:14,190
refer to as feature itís which is when a

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,600
manager comes to you and says I gotta

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,660
have this thing in this piece of

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,600
software right about now and you go what

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,310
but you know he only stack it on the

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,320
giant pile of other crap you've asked me

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,940
for he's like yeah it's got this is

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,140
really important it's like different

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,430
from the really important stuff from

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,050
last week yes differ from

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,820
really important stuff but you know that

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,100
I'm actually tossing all of my testing

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,040
out for this yeah we're we just accept

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,360
that as a risk they accept that as a

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,150
risk what an who says that you

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,770
know it's like it that everybody we all

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,110
say that by the way we're all the

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,730
 but everybody does that they

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,680
all say I accept the risk you get in

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,400
your car you're accepting a risk this

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,930
guy is accepting a risk on your behalf

00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,480
but you're still going to get blamed for

00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,530
it right that's what I call feature itís

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,750
it's an inflammation of the feature and

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:09,270
and you're really the guy is real his

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,310
problem is he is definitely not focused

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,530
on delivery he's probably not being

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,480
graded on that you're not either if

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,650
you're a developer you're probably not

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,510
being development being great on

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,020
delivery which is in my opinion a huge

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:25,290
problem now this is the place where I

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,840
live most of the time I before I was a

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,300
Java guy back when java came out i was i

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,670
became a Java developer in the mid-90s

00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,980
and I was a Java developer until about

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,570
two thousand six when I had that

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,990
epiphany when I realized what a giant

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,220
 what was and I went but I and

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,500
the reason that happened i'll give you

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,430
the shortest version i can is i went to

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,600
this place and i was there for about I

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,810
was there for a really long time for

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,150
days and I still couldn't compile the

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,650
software there was it was a limit of

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:59,220
Larry large complicated system where

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,160
we're using a web application developer

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,180
to do the build or to edit the code

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:10,820
really but when i sat down i checked the

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:13,170
software out of CVS and I I went okay

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,630
compiled everybody if you're a java guy

00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,050
it's basically eclipse right you just

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:21,600
compile set to compile automatically

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,940
edit the code red

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,549
and I'm like okay well that's all right

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,190
how do i run this oh you need to set

00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:31,260
your system up to run it how do I do

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,020
that well you need to talk to one of the

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,530
guys that's done it Wow who would that

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:40,559
be well just just go find yourself one

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,630
okay hey how did this I don't know that

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,100
you know less went and did it for me go

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,020
to last how do you do this well I

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,490
actually got him to teach me how to do

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,450
this like well did he teach you how to

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,730
do it or did you just do it for it well

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,330
hey just did it for me well where is he

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,620
oh he's dead he wasn't really dead he

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,419
was gone but I mean that makes the joke

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,950
a lot funny right but so there's this

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,590
guy who knows how to do this he's not

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,210
with you anymore that guy doesn't heat

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,789
you no longer know how to handle your

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:09,179
problem you don't understand how to get

00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:13,380
to a place of success and so I I went oh

00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:15,570
my god I'm this guy I'm the guy who

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,539
wrote this really crappy piece of

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,580
software that I can't even get to run I

00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:24,419
really wasn't me but I'm not obviously I

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,490
was being being little philosophical

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:28,080
there but I had done it over and over I

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,390
done this to people I had done this to

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,130
people i had written software that works

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,000
like a champ on my box what tells your

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:38,520
problem so when I did that I went it was

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,770
this it's like it's like that picture on

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,990
the wall that's the one the beautiful

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,720
woman and then the Crone once you see

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:48,630
both things you can never unsee it ever

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,250
again and if you can if you're in the

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,610
position right now where you cannot

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,830
unsee those two things if you can't

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:58,020
unsee those things you're actually in a

00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,700
very enviable position in my opinion for

00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,340
software developers in the world because

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,179
there is a hell of a lot of them sitting

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,919
about who can still not see it they

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,080
still look in the go what's the big deal

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,700
it's an operational problem operational

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,770
guys are like an these guys give me

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,299
all the time it's like no they don't you

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,679
just aren't working at it hard enough

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,230
you're not working at communicating with

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,860
him hard enough no these guys suck okay

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,900
so having this this site in your head

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,600
being able to see both the pictures at

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,820
the same time made it so that I had to

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,130
become a guy stopped writing software I

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,080
haven't written real software years I

00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,190
write maven plugins and i'll write

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,460
puppet manifest and

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,230
i right chefs recipes and I I write glue

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,270
that glues tons of stuff together and I

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,450
what workflows but I haven't written a

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:48,210
system in a long time because i could

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,040
not make myself sit down and write

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,230
software like eva if you gave me an

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,210
assignment right now i would spend weeks

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,650
probably riding all the automation

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,380
around it before i ever wrote a line of

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,720
code and i'm not saying that that's what

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,640
you should do i'm saying that that's

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,940
what how I got to where I am and while

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,580
we're having this it frankly sort of

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,280
meandering conversation when you get

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,290
your project your code was likely built

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,760
or the the build was likely produced by

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,320
in this deck in the case where I had

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,550
somebody who's no longer associated with

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,860
it so if you have a problem and it's

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,980
complicated you're screwed you have to

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,430
go become me and nobody wants to be me

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,020
that'd be weird um your build likely

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,640
hasn't had an overhaul in a long time

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,040
this is this is what I like refer to it

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,810
everybody knows bit rod is right there's

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,870
no such thing as different that's

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,160
 code does not stop working

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,720
overtime the world progresses past it

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,030
that's what happens the code is

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,130
perfectly fine at the time when you put

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,200
it away and it did run if you went back

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,120
in time it would still run back at that

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,030
point but that's not where you are now

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,830
so you haven't had an overhaul probably

00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,180
in a really long time on your bill the

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,070
way you have it had an overhaul and

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,020
practically anything because you're a

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,810
software guy you're moving forward all

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,320
the time and that's good it really is

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,990
but it really kind of it it really does

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,690
it takes a really long time to do these

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:16,080
things and when you get to the point

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:19,770
where you have this um where you have

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,990
done this this massive beat down on your

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,400
build and you get finished let's say

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,620
you're like okay we're overhauling the

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,060
bill we're going this is a 3,000 line

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:32,430
ant build and we're going to switch it

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:34,410
to a 2,000 line maven ha then I mean you

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,690
you you you puked out that was the lines

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,790
of code which is really good but you get

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,160
to the end and you might as well start

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,690
again because time has passed things

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,130
have shifted the world has progressed

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,930
forward maybe it hasn't gone far enough

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,960
to really screw you over but it probably

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,030
did and

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,130
when you have this build you get to this

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,750
very this kind of rebuild thing and it

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,240
really doesn't do everything you need to

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,890
do in the first place you are Zima

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,900
hairdo is a java guys in here anybody

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,690
job of people like oh well all four of

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,570
you Wow usually there's more so are you

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,490
mavin people Gradle people whatever do

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:12,160
you do that may even release plugin to

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:16,250
do your releases on your software do you

00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,780
yes damn right you do because if you're

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,790
going to use a tool like maven you

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,110
should at least you know screen every

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,960
bit of you can't have it but it's a

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:26,240
giant pain in the ass setting up these

00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,100
pieces to do all this stuff is a giant

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,710
pain in the ass nobody wants to do that

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,210
and yet if you don't your life is going

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,590
to suck somewhere down the road you have

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,820
to do this overhaul you're going to have

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,560
to go through this process and you're

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:44,570
not going to be able to deliver very

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:47,590
well oh forgot this part does everybody

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:50,810
know what I mean by that yep course you

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:55,550
magic build machine oh I don't know what

00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:57,830
that is liars so when I got to this

00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,180
magic place where I had my epiphany they

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,420
had a machine you could build the

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,260
software on it just was it yours and I'm

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:08,540
like well is it can I do like a p2 v2 p

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,890
on this and actually get this machine on

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,940
my bike and they're like let me know

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,760
what that means and I'm like I'm not

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,410
even sure it's going to work and there

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,760
is a machine somewhere where the build

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,380
will actually work but it won't work

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,940
when you're like if you're the guy who's

00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,160
ready for the release manager and you're

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,050
like in charge of doing it hell no you

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,480
know check out the code do the bill do

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,790
the release process doesn't work well it

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,560
works on the build machine hey

00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,600
this is the bills machine that's just

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:36,230
some machine that you guys futz around

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,730
with to make it things happen that's

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,980
really my favorite part by the way of

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:43,340
builds the magic build machine is is

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,720
possibly one of the things I i have to

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,630
admit something i actually physically

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,799
assaulted somebody for that one time

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:53,759
many years ago like

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,789
more than five years ago I i got i have

00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,070
a bit of an anger management problem and

00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:01,889
so there guys he goes we'll just make

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,019
your machine looked like this and it's a

00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:05,220
windows box i mean like you know how do

00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:09,389
you make a windows box look like another

00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,159
windows box copy just just clone it and

00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:13,049
see if you can make it happen right well

00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,190
it couldn't it didn't happen and finally

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,019
I might look it's not working he guys

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,779
what's not my problem and I'm like it's

00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,039
about to become your problem and he goes

00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:25,499
what are you gonna do what my ass and

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:27,779
I'm like yep he goes no you're not I'm

00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:29,999
like dude I have literally beaten up

00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:33,090
hundreds of people across my life I used

00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:35,970
to be a bouncer and you're just another

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,070
one to me I mean I go do I will I will

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,799
not lose a moment's sleep on this and

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,029
the guy was like he goes what are you

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,470
gonna do and I said first I'm gonna slap

00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:46,019
you in the head and he goes what I went

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,940
like this and he's like you're not

00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,830
kidding are you and I said yes I'm dead

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,179
serious I at the end you're gonna be

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,320
bleeding and I'm still not gonna have

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,809
what I want why don't you just give me

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,279
what I want and we'll skip all the blood

00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:00,659
I wish that was the only instance of

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,580
that kind of say that in my life like I

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,859
said I have I have like literally dozens

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:09,029
of those stories where I'm incapable of

00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:10,889
controlling my behavior and right back

00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,649
to the story releasing you suck at

00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:16,409
releasing you do because good delivery

00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:18,059
depends on release management managing

00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,369
the process of release is really

00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:23,639
essential to this it's actually process

00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:25,440
management there's you you probably you

00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:29,249
don't use the Maven release bug and you

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,529
don't do you not ever yeah okay

00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:33,119
sometimes if you get it sometimes hell

00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:35,549
that's better than almost everybody I've

00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,309
ever been to they get hard with some

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,779
frequency to fix the Maven problem like

00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,129
we have a maven problem I'm like no you

00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,019
have a developer problem but anyway

00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:45,720
let's fix that and you get to the inner

00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,580
light well like well share it I I'm

00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,649
going to give you a little bit of vomit

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,960
that I had in the past they're like oh

00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:54,869
well we have a maven repository but we

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,399
check it all into subversion now for

00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:59,009
people who are made in people have you

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,149
ever used maybe if you that probably if

00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:03,539
you go how the hell did you do that yeah

00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:07,299
exactly the problem they are tracking

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:10,509
basically the back end of a system using

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,309
what amounts to a database and that is a

00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:14,739
really terrible idea with maven because

00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:17,019
maven is designed to be repeatable under

00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:18,849
a variety of circumstances and so when

00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:22,089
you do it that way when you do it the

00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:23,440
stupid way it takes away from the whole

00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,989
the value that you're getting for

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,519
anything and it doesn't matter whether

00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:29,409
it's maven or you know or if you're

00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,659
doing builder or whatever whatever tool

00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:33,580
you're using all your software basically

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:35,919
has tons of dependencies that deal with

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,989
it and that's what maven fixes a problem

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,849
that maven started fixing was dependency

00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:41,649
management in Java and it was a huge

00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,929
problem and they really still haven't

00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:45,849
gotten it right but you have to have

00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:48,159
that you have to have the ability to use

00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,749
the tool correctly and if you don't you

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,549
actually give yourself more trouble than

00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:53,289
less once again this is why people they

00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:57,009
hire me in there like I got to fix this

00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:58,599
maven problem I go and say oh my god do

00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,210
you like the third people have seen like

00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,249
this in six months they're like really

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,419
yeah like this is a this thing where I

00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:05,710
said the checking all the maven

00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,379
repository and do a subversion thing

00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,249
that's a good that's a thing people do

00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,839
apparently is the thing lots of people

00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:12,279
do because hell I've seen I saw it three

00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,259
times in six months and i'm pretty sure

00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:16,950
i didn't live in the weirdo world where

00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:20,769
no all the people who did that are so I

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:23,859
that you have to have you have to have a

00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:25,779
focus on the process of delivery and an

00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:29,409
understanding of the process as it

00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:34,450
applies to the tool because if you don't

00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:36,039
dude seriously hey that's but that's by

00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,509
the way you probably don't release code

00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,979
and that's as defined by me because I

00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,029
have a very strict definition of what

00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:42,099
that means but that's really what that

00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,769
man so I went off on a lower ramp there

00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:46,989
um you're your release process almost

00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:49,210
certainly does not document results of

00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:51,489
what happened like what is this release

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,769
really I mean by by me or for a release

00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,690
it has all talk about this later but

00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,089
it's a very specific point in time and

00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,950
it means very specific things to me

00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,999
you're like oh we release the software

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,169
today I'm like well which features did

00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,629
you release they're like whoa I don't

00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:07,839
know then you really didn't if I can do

00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:09,279
it as far as I'm concerned you probably

00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,729
have to hand manage your releases

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,090
there's probably not some sort of robot

00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:17,400
monkey in the background going

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,280
but but and release Paul is out and you

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,870
get values you get documentation you get

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,300
versioning you get management of all

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,150
this stuff probably not almost certainly

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,100
not because if you did then I would have

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,100
probably heard about more instances

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,390
where that actually happened now let's

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,970
think about this for a minute there's

00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,400
tons of software and I'm a fedora guy

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:41,310
I'm a red hat guy but in the

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,710
repositories for fedora there are women

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,680
there are thousands of packages so this

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:49,140
 has to work somewhere right right I

00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,990
mean that's it seems reasonable to say

00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,220
that and I have fallen through the

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,690
release processes for some of these

00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,060
packages i have actually done it myself

00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:01,410
worked with people who did it and they

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:04,740
don't suck at this game and then there's

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:07,440
the other 99 percent of people who once

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,660
again do get paid to do this and they

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,950
they're the drivers for people who do

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,540
open source software or just radically

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,370
different when I come to these things

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,570
and I later on somebody will come up to

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,160
me and they're like you don't really

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,050
have this you know we we release

00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,400
software you know all the time and not

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,140
like okay who do you work for and

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,940
they're like well you know I work with

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:28,410
the blank project and I went well okay

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,860
what do you do for money and they're

00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,990
like oh I work for some net shot all

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,150
right well can't you just take the

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,400
things you learn there and apply them

00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,880
over here and they're like yeah it's

00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,110
really hard I'm like I know I know it's

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,530
really easy to stand up here and

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,810
about it that I can tell you that so

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:51,090
this is the part people forget

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:54,090
configuration in a Linux though in the

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,490
linux world in the in the UNIX world we

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,410
externalized configuration from the

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:01,770
beginning more or less we had Etsy and

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,690
it was and it was awesome and Etsy who

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:06,180
is where all our configurations lived be

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,330
back in the bad old days and you had a

00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,800
file and we liked it it sucked you had

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,630
to edit that where the Emacs or

00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,860
vio or whatever you use and you're like

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,910
I don't even know how to configure this

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,790
thing like well you had to go read the

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,350
man you'll learn how to do it well good

00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,030
because that configuration file was a

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,470
hell of a lot better than the database

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,530
dump that you have to do in order to do

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,560
it halfback applications i use now

00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,910
there's a tool I'm going to this is

00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,680
going to go on the internet right okay

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,080
I'm not going to say that tool but

00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,730
there's a tool that I use a lot that has

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,530
a database behind it and once you've

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,500
installed and started using this tool

00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:42,440
that's it dog no more you can't even

00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,450
unload the database and move it to

00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,420
another place and have two of them it

00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,770
just doesn't work so having this having

00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,600
your data your externalized

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,310
configuration be easily accessible in

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,190
manageable and source code controllable

00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,500
means what I say when I say externalized

00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:01,250
configuration makes or breaks deliveries

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,720
if I can do if I can do a configuration

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,790
that's the config for tests and the

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,950
configuration for prod I can have a

00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,690
Devon a test configuration our product

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,600
and fishery and it's a really easy thing

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,920
to do you might actually do it if it's

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,660
hard if you have to go build a database

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,730
and run a button dump a bunch of crap

00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,440
into that database and edit the stuff in

00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,830
the database by hand which I did last

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,870
week again then that nobody does that

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,690
you're like screw this dude i'll just go

00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,190
work against prod I'll run I'll run my

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,580
tests against the prod could how about

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:36,320
that is what you got and people do

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,850
i do I did still do I'm almost always

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,400
your code is configured internally

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,920
you've got some baked in crap in the

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,650
inside you have a my favorite so far is

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,060
the database server URL that's baked

00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,890
into a couple of systems that I had to

00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,900
work with sometimes it's not configured

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,370
at all sometimes you literally cannot

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,490
change the configuration even by

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:59,030
rebuilding the software if you do this

00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,890
you're kind of a jerk because when you

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,090
do that what that means is I did it

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,060
right the first time in screw you

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:07,550
hippies and I don't think that you

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,929
probably did your software probably

00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,730
isn't necessarily built for my

00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,440
environment and I I'm all I certainly

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:18,409
have a database server that's not called

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,030
felix almost certainly and when you have

00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,620
configurations that are difficult to

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,440
manage and harder to source code source

00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,899
control then this problem sort of starts

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,240
creeping along it gets big just

00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:31,520
continues to get worse and having these

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,919
having these problems means that you are

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,600
generally living with ace with a piece

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,870
of software that is configuration

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,100
it is surrounded by modes of alligators

00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,020
effectively it is impossible to breach

00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,880
the configuration it is surrounded by

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,800
alligators or flaming oil it's

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,170
possibility there's a flaming oil or

00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,610
there is oily flaming alligators

00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:53,090
depending on how you're going to do that

00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:55,580
but there's always this this hurdle you

00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:59,720
have to cross to deal with that you okay

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:04,160
how do you configure ntp anybody in the

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:08,480
ntp demon sorry NT to be calm is there

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,550
another way to configure ATP yeah but is

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:19,460
there another way really a different way

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:22,310
to configure ntp right sure in the UNIX

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,710
world there's really more or less one

00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,150
way you edit some config file and you do

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,950
the thing and it gives you this config

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,430
ball and it works now in the Microsoft

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:35,750
world is radically different but in real

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:39,080
software then it's it is a it's done

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:42,740
with it's done with a file right that is

00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,050
I I feel so old when I say that but it's

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,370
like man that's that was they just got

00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:53,210
it right the first time it's not XML is

00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:56,330
not yamo it's not gotta hate yamo it's

00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:59,330
not some weird okay I beats the hell

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:02,480
out of and and Richard is not in here

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:04,220
thank God that but it beats the hell out

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,290
of having an SQLite database that holds

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,390
all my configuration in it it does I'm

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,240
sorry I don't want to drive a database

00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:14,570
to change a URL for your application I

00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,130
just don't um so you're not delivering

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,420
its new you what you want to do is you

00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,460
want to drop the pizza off in 30 minutes

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,110
like the thing goes right but you

00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,060
probably don't have somebody who sort

00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,590
more or less in charge of that if you do

00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,300
they're probably not very good at their

00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,520
job I know because I trained these

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,340
people pretty regularly and in my

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,240
opinion the people that I work with who

00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:37,190
are called release managers are really

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,900
non-technical effectively speaking they

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,180
are non-technical they are much more

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,460
suited for the food services or

00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,340
janitorial industries in my opinion than

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,450
they are for release management and that

00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,710
is not a that is that is not a

00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,410
degradation to those things

00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,990
it is a different world to live in these

00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,760
are people who in my opinion should have

00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,859
stuck with middle management or whatever

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,630
other useless crap they do and not

00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:02,839
gotten in the way of the developers and

00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,550
the operations people they frequently

00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,560
don't deliver on time you probably don't

00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,540
deliver if you write software who in

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,560
here made their last deadline and nail

00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:14,690
that really yeah I'm good so more

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,310
than zero people I sure didn't because I

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,520
was I was going to I was like duh no no

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:24,349
I didn't actually but awesome so one out

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,990
of 35 that's probably about right like

00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:29,440
five percent I would say is about what

00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,430
I've seen in working in large and large

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,839
enterprises that's less than that most

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,650
of the time now it's usually they get to

00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:41,240
it uh yeah that's meant to be Thursday

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,740
turns out it's Saturday so I really hate

00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,599
this whole clicking the mouse thing by

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:48,260
the way excuse me clicking the trackpad

00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,839
um you have a difficult time expressing

00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,520
what was delivered which features got

00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:54,109
delivered whoa we deliver these features

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,190
really did you roadmap those do you have

00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:56,660
those tight all the way back to source

00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,599
code control to the bill did you manage

00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,540
to make all that happen yeah that list

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,859
is actually not exactly complete we have

00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,690
a couple of features that made it into

00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:07,520
the end how did that happen well you

00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,770
know we didn't edit the file before we

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,119
delivered it to you well why would you

00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,410
have to edit the file to the libertines

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,200
why don't--you're what isn't your bill

00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,030
just harvest this information from the

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,920
canonical source of information about

00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,950
this which would be the source code

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,260
control system and my issue tracker and

00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:26,540
puke that out as part of the bill well

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,030
because that's hard to set up no it's my

00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,320
not that hard to set up but you do have

00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,080
to do it you have to make you have to

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,430
babysit it a little bit well it doesn't

00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,349
know it's true it doesn't always work

00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,240
but that's usually because some jackass

00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:42,230
decided not to actually update an issue

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,270
to write it is failed on me several

00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,460
times I I fully admit that everything

00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,740
I'm telling you about all the stuff I'm

00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:51,740
complaining about has some fragility to

00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,750
it it's software there's me get sunspots

00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,270
I actually had a machine go down during

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:59,030
one of the corona things that happened

00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,810
last year yeah that was awesome I'm like

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,580
I

00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:05,560
she had something died during the South

00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:08,270
but like I did it should happen man but

00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,520
but that was that was like a that was

00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,960
like a pinnacle moment for me too

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,360
because I'd been bitching about sunspot

00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,640
activity for decades and then it was

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,830
like really happens I did really believe

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,310
that like it was like third of a data

00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,480
center to not like one machine but the

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,160
one thing you're probably not doing is

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,870
you're probably not delivering a noodle

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,210
artifacts if you're not working for

00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,610
something that dumps into one of the the

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,170
RPM databases or that the Debian

00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,120
databases for Ubuntu or something like

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,610
that you're probably not delivering

00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,400
truly immutable stuff you probably don't

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,440
bake something tag it build it take the

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,030
result hand it to a gude and say this is

00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,080
it and he goes well what if I have to

00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,090
change it you go well here's your

00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,920
configuration information change these

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,320
files and read it all it'll read these

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,580
config files and you do it because now

00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,080
this is not working you're like oh hold

00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,150
on I gotta go Cup I gotta go fix the

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,490
code if you ever have to go back to the

00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,630
code to configure something you don't

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,880
really have something that's truly

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,250
immutable you have a you have a mostly a

00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,970
mutable and immutable is a real is what

00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:09,500
is what it is what the absolutes it's an

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,230
absolute it's either immutable or its

00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,310
mutable um you probably don't keep the

00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,500
results of this and some sound

00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,360
reasonable like repository if you're if

00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,970
you build rpms you sure as hell do

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,290
though or you probably do um this is

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,880
actually gotten a lot better for a whole

00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,760
bunch of people in the last four or five

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,320
years but still not the best thing in

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,900
the whole world when I when I when I

00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,360
walk into a because what it what does

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,460
the world run on again what is the

00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,560
software that the world runs on Craig

00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,510
answer that is it's it's a it's a trick

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,990
question the correct answer is Kobol but

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:44,150
i'm looking for java and when you when

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,830
you get into when you get into a place

00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,810
that's a java that's a java shop

00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,370
frequently there's there is one tool

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,690
there's effectively one tool you should

00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,910
be using to make that work it's called

00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,770
nexus the repository for java software

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,540
is nexus there's these other ones

00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,040
there's archive and artifactory and

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,650
they're just fine the correct answer is

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,880
nexus and it's not because Nexus is good

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,820
or because I happen to be friends with

00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,470
the guy that wrote it but because it

00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,800
just works better than the other ones do

00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,390
and when you if you don't put your stuff

00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,170
in at least one of these things and

00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,819
build out of it and stop

00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,230
changing stuff then you're really not

00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,970
dealing with in ute ability and you're

00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:22,799
not storing your stuff in a way that

00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,940
other people can get to it yeah so once

00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:26,280
again this is the horse I love to kick

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,460
your stuff probably isn't recognizably

00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,380
versioned okay so if you were here last

00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,730
year you heard me scream about this over

00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,559
and over again you're welcome to ignore

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,200
this whole thing there is exactly one

00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:40,829
way to version software that is correct

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,960
all other ways are wrong semantic

00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:45,299
versioning is the correct mechanism for

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,270
versioning your software and every other

00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:51,180
way is wrong it is it is mathematically

00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,890
wrong I can actually prove to you why

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,170
it's wrong I'm not getting good at math

00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,490
and I can prove to you why is wrong

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,260
what's the date format what is a date

00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:04,829
date format what's the correct date

00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:11,190
format well what is the correct date

00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:14,190
format damaged people suck but why why

00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:18,089
is this answer right year year year year

00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:21,210
month month day day our our second

00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:23,549
second Micro Micro Micro times up why is

00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:28,069
that correct because it's a

00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:30,930
standard because you well that's why

00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:32,430
that's actually the right answer but

00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,650
it's because it's a standard it's not

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:36,480
because it's the right answer it's

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,670
because people have accepted this is the

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,839
right answer semantic versioning is not

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,450
right because it's right it's right

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,690
because people look at it and go totally

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:47,520
makes sense and if you saw my thing from

00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,520
last year where I put all the really bad

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,319
examples of people's versions up I I

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,780
have found some new ones and I just

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,640
stopped updating that slide is so

00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,079
painful to watch some of the dumb crap

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,480
that people put in the middle of a

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,270
version why do you put that they're low

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,740
later I want to be able to understand

00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,040
where it came from how I need to know

00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,150
which revision that came from we don't

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,920
that should be baked into that build

00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,619
well it's not so I have to figure it out

00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,079
you don't have a tag in your source code

00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:21,110
control system that points to that that

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:23,970
thing well no well you're now solve it

00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,280
because there's a there already told for

00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:31,260
this yes and if I just called you an

00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,520
 once again bring it on I get it

00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,930
not everybody agrees with me about

00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,160
semantic versioning the way but not

00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,160
everybody agrees with me about the date

00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,480
format but the truth is is that more

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,220
people start to agree with me about

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,640
semantic versioning and there's a

00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:48,120
freaking iso standard for the day so I'm

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,770
pretty sure I got it what's that well

00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:53,520
there's there's the one there's the one

00:43:49,770 --> 00:44:00,360
though there's an 85 96 I like I ought

00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:01,500
to know the answer to this but so you're

00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,620
going to tell you're going to walk off

00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,370
onto this calendar thing for me right

00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,720
you're going to give me that you're

00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:20,070
going to give me the bigger Dorian

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:21,300
calendar issue or the yeah why right

00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,080
well it's actually a standard it's an

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,400
iso standard so it's actually

00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,400
international standard at this point

00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,890
yeah yeah it's true that's you're

00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,290
absolutely right about this and when you

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,910
put that when you print that out and you

00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,300
what who was it said that's just a

00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:42,480
minute ago why is it why is it better

00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:45,000
because it's sortable having the data be

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,680
consistent across the world I I am the

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,670
first to admit I'm the first admit that

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,910
I will typically be an ugly American

00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:53,310
about a lot of things but this is

00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,050
actually one of the ones we got right we

00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,700
don't do that a lot we up a lot of

00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,320
stuff at this country especially in

00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,750
other countries this is one of the ones

00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,910
we got right I'm holding on to this one

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,950
you get it other people have their

00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,860
standards and I'm totally I'm behind you

00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,750
you can sit over there and be that way

00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,760
that you are all the time and I and I

00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,250
fully support your ID you're the idea

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,500
that these exist but there is a real

00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:23,360
good reason why this particular one is

00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:26,280
better and what they're not meant

00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,620
exactly and when you tonight when you

00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,830
show an iso date when you give it to

00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:37,110
somebody will if you don't localize that

00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:38,790
date what are you if you're in France

00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,730
and I have a date that I've stored and

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:44,220
you show me that date in some in some

00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:47,220
American format you're an you

00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,440
just are because these people have all

00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,360
you you and you and you everybody we've

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,410
all come up with the way that we we see

00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,750
these things that's why we have

00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,970
localization but when you put that

00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,910
into a piece of software and it has to

00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:02,250
be read it needs to be a read it needs

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:07,170
to be read in one way because the one

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:10,650
way is the right way now beyond all that

00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:14,270
why am I so pissed about this well I'm a

00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:16,650
consultant I I make a fairly good living

00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:19,440
being angry about these problems and

00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,630
because they exist you would think dude

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,500
what do you like bitching because you

00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:27,900
have work well yeah I am actually I work

00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,610
in dev ops that's what I do I train

00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,780
people to talk to each other that's

00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:35,490
really what I do as my whole job in life

00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,500
is to train people to talk to each other

00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:40,530
I know that probably seems weird when

00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,730
you consider how sort of angry talky I

00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,550
am but I'm actually pretty good at that

00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:47,850
part of it for whatever reason people

00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:50,820
like me I don't like them back but they

00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:54,590
like me and I see a bunch of broken

00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:57,690
every day I see if I walk in I'm like

00:46:54,590 --> 00:47:00,500
you want to do continuous delivery right

00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:05,430
because you heard that it's awesome okay

00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:09,870
well why don't we have a way to build

00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:12,030
your code first I always start with like

00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,950
the genetic level problems and work our

00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,700
way up let's place don't overstretch

00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:20,400
let's try to work our way up to that and

00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,480
so when you get there they pay us a lot

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,400
of money but they help I you really

00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,340
wants it fixed because it's too much

00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,380
work no I don't want to they don't let

00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,440
us get to the problem and succeed or

00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,090
more specifically they don't let me

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,690
succeed the way that my anal retentive

00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:38,160
ass wants to succeed I onyx

00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:41,520
ought to be and if it's not there it's

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,650
just wrong and i get it i've walked away

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,050
from jobs i've walked away from every

00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:48,450
job i've ever been in with looking back

00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:51,180
and going well that's wrong I've never

00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,980
fully succeeded but that's just as a

00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:57,060
personal failing on my part not because

00:47:52,980 --> 00:48:00,420
the thing didn't work so an environment

00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,760
is a specifically configured platform it

00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:06,030
is a state environment can be a variety

00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,300
of things enum like it's a it's a cintas

00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:11,069
63 box with a particular my sequel

00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,720
database installed on it the way you

00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,030
build an environment is through some

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,940
automation that's just all there is to

00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:19,740
it all other ways suck now when you say

00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,740
okay well I have an ami that I cranked

00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,540
up on ec2 okay how'd you get that am i

00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,940
again how'd you get it from somebody

00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:29,280
how'd they get it well they they just

00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,630
pulled it out there handsome well why

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,760
don't you start with something that you

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:34,470
understand layer the correct things on

00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,900
it automatically and then know how to

00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,280
change it later this is a business I

00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,450
hate have to walk through this but I

00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,910
walk through with every one of our

00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:43,710
customers what is a release it is the in

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,380
the process of producing an immutable

00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:51,240
artifact is a by-god this is where it is

00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:53,730
in time in get terms it's a it's a sha-1

00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,200
of a tree ish it's someplace in the

00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:59,819
software that we have said is it's a tag

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,380
frequently it's a thing that produces

00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:03,720
the thing that we are going to use and

00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,490
it should be managed as an independent

00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,859
versioned entity like you should really

00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,540
think about it once you've detached it

00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:10,859
from source code control you really can

00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,940
think about it as a completely different

00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:15,060
thing now you might have to walk back

00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,670
over to the Pigpen to get into it again

00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,170
but once you've got a release you should

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,569
be able to handle that that's what that

00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:25,170
should do the work we've already talked

00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:27,060
about version it it doesn't even matter

00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,369
if you use semantic version although if

00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,319
you don't you're wrong the summer it

00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:32,700
needs to be semantically notable you

00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,990
need to be I need to be able to compare

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,250
the things I need to be able to know

00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,170
that this version is more than this

00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,760
version that this version is compatible

00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,140
with this other version that's what

00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,670
semantic version gives you by the way

00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,200
it's not really about the number it's

00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,300
about compatibility it's about API

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,530
compatibility which I will about

00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:51,210
tomorrow a deployment is when you take a

00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,560
release and you make it accessible into

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,740
an environment see how put all those

00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,109
together and it's inserting a version of

00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:00,390
a generally released artifact into an

00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:04,440
environment when you've done that you've

00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:07,109
made a delivery but remember out said

00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,910
you're not really delivering if you did

00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:11,250
it and it's something you suffered

00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:14,250
through the process you didn't need to

00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:17,010
do that it doesn't have to be hard um it

00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:20,369
doesn't need to be as hard as it is and

00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:23,130
the reason that it is not damn it it is

00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:25,290
not easy is that we have this we have

00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:27,420
this view of zones of control in

00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:29,250
software that's not my problem and we

00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:32,310
ought you might refer to those as silos

00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,900
where you come from but in what I do

00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,220
what the thing that I'm allegedly

00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,079
supposed to be doing when I go to my

00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,050
clients is kind of bridging those zones

00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,660
of control and in a communication is

00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:45,510
supposed to improve and automation

00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,579
should go up not down and human

00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:52,109
introduced failure should go down but it

00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:53,550
doesn't I you might say that i'm not

00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:56,430
good at what i do at that point right I

00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,500
you would not be completely wrong but

00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,150
frequently it actually goes down before

00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,880
it goes up again because people get

00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:04,680
really freaked out about this operation

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,390
people in the room have you ever

00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,119
wondered whether your job would be

00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,150
automated away from you of course you

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,770
have I mean I do primarily operations

00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:16,290
now I don't really do a whole bunch of

00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:18,750
code monkey stuff and I have frequently

00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,569
looked at this and said if this is what

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:24,210
I did for a living really I just replace

00:51:21,569 --> 00:51:26,359
my shelf for the shell script not really

00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:29,880
but I mean obviously I'm being I'm being

00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:33,810
expansive there but that but yeah I just

00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:36,510
took away I actually try to take away

00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:38,730
operations people's positions I don't

00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,349
want you to not have a job I want you to

00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,119
do a better job I want you do something

00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:44,810
cooler than what you do if you had to

00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:50,300
shell into that box to make that happen

00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:50,300
hmm well we can fix that so

00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:56,070
nobody wants to suffer nobody really

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,720
wants to lose their job I don't want you

00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,700
to lose your job I want you to be I want

00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,100
you to be more awesomer than what you

00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,960
were before DevOps addressable issues

00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,630
arise from a whole bunch of different

00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,210
stupid things and they don't people

00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,830
don't really want them solved they

00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,910
really don't what you want them solved

00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,440
and you want them solved and I want

00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,790
themselves but there's these people that

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,430
float above us that don't really want

00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:21,000
them solved they really don't because

00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:23,640
they don't they think of you operations

00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,270
guy developer guy operations guy

00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:30,180
developer guy pick me too who's it who's

00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:32,430
a developer you too you are the same

00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,860
person to that / to those people you are

00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:37,260
you are you're just a different flavor

00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:39,270
of freak on a leash you're this nerd

00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,040
that they lock up in the some room with

00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:43,050
great air conditioning or your this guy

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,550
that they shove into some cube farm with

00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,080
all the other nerdy little friends and

00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,850
they've talked about and they laugh at

00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,900
you behind your back they do I know

00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,310
because I mean some of those meetings

00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,180
where they talk about how nerdy we are

00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:56,610
I'm like pizza I'm right here I'm

00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:59,670
sitting right here and they're like yeah

00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:01,380
they're all nerdy I can't have no idea

00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:07,080
how big my comic book collection hands

00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:08,760
and so when you when you when you get

00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,440
involved in when you're in software when

00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,270
you're in the guts and blood of software

00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,190
they think of you like you're the same

00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:16,020
and so they don't give a if your

00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:19,200
problems get solved is anybody in here

00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,510
mid-level management didn't think you

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,700
don't up to that right yeah where she

00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:27,570
won't that's like call yourself project

00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,830
manager they don't want all the problems

00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,510
they don't want your problem solve these

00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,220
ones there a problem solved which is I

00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:34,140
want that this you have to put this

00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,400
feature into production at this time and

00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,800
blah blah blah and they don't get a

00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,140
how you do it and when people don't care

00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,790
how you do something you frequently

00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,790
don't care how you do something and

00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:48,210
that's that tends to be a problem there

00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:50,850
the the idea of of communicating with

00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:53,070
other people as a mechanism for

00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:56,340
addressing the inequity between the two

00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:59,310
kinds of weirdos that we all are because

00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:02,100
we're all both kinds honestly the two

00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:03,470
the two factions of software addressing

00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,250
that in that in equi

00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:09,630
communicating with your people can

00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:11,730
actually stop that problem but the

00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:15,000
problem with that is is that people

00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:16,290
don't communicate they in in in an

00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,980
environment if you two worked in the

00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:22,110
same place you would probably actively

00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,600
dislike each other most of the time Bob

00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:26,070
Scott Gaynor continued no software guy

00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,380
ob's guess I'll forget you even have

00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:30,420
labels for it so that you can know that

00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:34,560
you're not all software people developer

00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:37,590
operations and so when we talk about

00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,570
what we do what I do in DevOps it does

00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:41,220
it really work like which is it does

00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:43,800
this whole idea of making communication

00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:47,250
happen work well you know I would say

00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,540
this sorta it sort of works I would love

00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,180
to set up here and tell you that what I

00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,950
do is amazingly successful and that I I

00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,020
walk in and people walk out and they're

00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,300
like man I wish I could be him they

00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,720
don't do that they come in then I when I

00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,380
leave a space they go well at least he

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,780
is gone a lot of times they say at least

00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,360
he's gone now we can get back to the to

00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,770
the you know work business of hating

00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,560
each other again that frequently

00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:14,940
happened but it doesn't have to it you

00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,500
shouldn't have to consider it as

00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,210
something special at all this

00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,740
communication between the between the

00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,170
bridging of the things should just that

00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:24,600
should just be the way it is you should

00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:27,690
just be able to look at somebody and say

00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,730
hey I have this software and you're now

00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,870
responsible for deploying it and they

00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:33,950
should not look at you like you just

00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:37,320
handed them a steaming pile of poo and

00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:38,820
if you've been in operations and you've

00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,540
received a piece of software to

00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:45,480
deployment you've almost certainly gone

00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:47,790
okay smells like poo you almost

00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,440
certainly have I know because I'm you

00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:51,930
know the problem is is that that's not

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,120
the way things are it isn't how things

00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,430
work that's why they drag my company I

00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,350
work for a reasonably large DevOps

00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:00,660
consultancy jeez name i'm not allowed to

00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:02,160
mention because I'm not allowed to uh

00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:05,130
because because I say a bunch of bad

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,380
words in my in my presentations and so

00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,850
but we have we have companies all over

00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,200
the place that dragged us into this

00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,510
stuff and we go in and we're like yeah

00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,220
automate yeah communicate yeah automate

00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:17,119
and they're like yeah

00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:18,890
yeah yeah we leave and they just and

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,740
it's not because what we did was bad is

00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:24,109
because they were they only did it when

00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:27,170
they were made to do it so here's what I

00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:29,630
think about this I think that there's no

00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:32,420
such thing as a DevOps KY I think

00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:34,820
there's no such thing as a DevOps mind

00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,040
frame I think there's actually two I

00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:39,170
think there's the communication part and

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,150
the automation part I think there's

00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:44,420
actually two completely different things

00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,500
about this and I think that very few

00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,290
people are good at both of those things

00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:51,560
I'm actually really good at automation I

00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:53,690
can make weird happen with tools

00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,250
that you've probably heard of and you

00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,780
could probably do exactly the same thing

00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,970
but I've just been doing it for a long

00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,220
time and that's the only reason I'm any

00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:03,440
good at it but I can automate the

00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,820
out of stuff and I can stand up here in

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,380
front in front of you and say a bunch of

00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,760
embarrassing things about myself and be

00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,800
kind of rude and everything and I can

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,359
also communicate with you I can even

00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,810
make you communicate with each other

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:16,280
while I'm there but I can make a lot of

00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:18,770
people do a lot of things while I'm

00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,970
there I mean sometimes even under threat

00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,460
of damage you know that sort of stuff

00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,900
but I can make it happen because people

00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,790
when I when I say here's what you should

00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,950
do they're like okay and they'll start

00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,300
doing and you're like yeah go go in and

00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:31,430
all of a sudden I'm like it I'm like a

00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,150
tennis judge right yeah yeah and I turn

00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:37,310
away and they're like throw the racket

00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:40,130
because this is just how people are I'm

00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:41,660
less good at the communication

00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,760
establishment pieces than I am at the

00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:46,640
automation part I think automation

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,170
experts are incredibly useful to dev ops

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,960
and I think communications people are

00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:52,849
but I think there's actually the process

00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,349
there's well ok I'm going to skip this

00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:55,730
part this is the part where I

00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:57,380
about people trying to hire devops

00:57:55,730 --> 00:58:00,140
engineers because I'm running out of

00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,180
time as i said i'm long winded this is

00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,190
where I about them the truth is is

00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,900
you just read this slide it should not

00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,460
you should not hired a Bop engineers you

00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,900
should not try to build devops engineers

00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,930
you should trade teacher goddamn

00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,760
management how to listen that's what you

00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,680
should do if you can get your management

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,750
to start listening everything becomes a

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,270
lot easier now you could also write me a

00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,740
big fat check but the management their

00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:23,630
their managers they're smarter than you

00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,289
if you were smart as they are they'd be

00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,900
a manager so there's really it's a

00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:31,119
a tough row to hoe but it is sort of the

00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,919
deal now of course they're smarter than

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,150
you because that's why things are so

00:58:32,919 --> 00:58:36,219
awesome and why you have smart

00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,719
management and because of this all of

00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:39,339
the stuff that I've said is completely

00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:40,929
wrong they're all the bad stuff i've

00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:42,400
talked about doesn't really even exist

00:58:40,929 --> 00:58:43,900
because management's so smart right

00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,650
they've got it they got this under

00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:53,229
control well no they don't and that's

00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:55,630
the segway so seriously no more segue um

00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,859
it is possible that some ups and the

00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,229
people you have to accept the idea that

00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:00,549
it might not work you have to accept the

00:58:59,229 --> 00:59:02,919
idea that it might not work but we know

00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:04,419
people that there can and maybe that

00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:06,039
what there is is there's this value

00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:08,949
system you need to install instill into

00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:11,559
people and these alleged values may help

00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:12,669
you with some of your fails so the

00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:13,809
points you're failing at and the

00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:15,009
solutions of those and then going back

00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:17,019
to talking about that we're not going to

00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:19,929
the first one the big one is Drive you

00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:22,179
have to want it you don't like your job

00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:25,359
enough if you don't want it to change to

00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:26,739
be better and you f that be the change

00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,229
you want to see in the role whatever

00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:31,359
 that means yeah sure you do you

00:59:29,229 --> 00:59:32,890
have to want to change and you have to

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,599
be willing to sacrifice occasionally the

00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,609
chicken but more importantly you might

00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:39,880
have to be willing to sacrifice somebody

00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:41,949
else's ego maybe yours may somebody's

00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,659
ego generally has to die when you get to

00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:45,669
this when you when you actually enacted

00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:47,799
any of this and you have to be willing

00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:49,839
to be unpopular I am very willing to be

00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:52,630
unpopular you have to be able to focus

00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,369
especially on the process good software

00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,719
is often almost always written in a

00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:57,759
meticulous fashion it's almost always

00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:00,400
done with solid process and it almost

00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:02,589
always has a process that accompanies it

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,630
most processes or does that most good

01:00:02,589 --> 01:00:07,539
processes were done designed not grown

01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:10,150
back to the farmer problem you have to

01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:12,880
be able to measure what it is that you

01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,679
are trying to improve on this is an

01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,390
agile thing in the world and you just

01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,890
have to be able to do it sometimes you

01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:21,880
have to be willing to take less velocity

01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:23,650
to get more measure and you need to be

01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,269
able to take those metrics and make them

01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:28,059
into something useful anybody work for

01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:30,069
an ISO 9000 company that's the whole

01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:31,390
deal right you you ISO 9000 you collect

01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:33,279
metrics and then you go back and change

01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:36,130
how stupid you were for doing it never

01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:38,529
happens um this is the last piece

01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,600
seriously I'm promise you have to be

01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:41,940
able to use

01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,710
everybody fails at recognizing the tiny

01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,950
little pieces that are the cumulative

01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:49,260
parts of the pain the pain is all about

01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,960
the small fail it's the I left this

01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,730
piece of software unformatted I let I I

01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,380
don't want to switch to from my shitty

01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:58,440
software to the source code control

01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:00,690
system something good it the way you fix

01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,220
this is you do stuff you automate a

01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,170
repetitive task you've reformat your

01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,490
code only do that once by the way don't

01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,340
continuously before Matt your code

01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:09,660
that's weird you adopt some intelligent

01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,490
and formative versioning system you

01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,750
clean up one of your stupid api's your

01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,850
API is are probably stupid you should

01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,680
clean them up and you fix one thing

01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,640
every day and you leave it it's like

01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,020
it's like they taught you in

01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,610
kindergarten leave their room a little

01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:25,290
cleaner than you left then you found it

01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:27,090
now um this is back to that whole part

01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:29,580
of the people you just got to teach

01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:30,750
people how to listen and in the truth is

01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,460
you probably don't have enough power to

01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:39,750
make that happen this is back to that

01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:42,660
piece any questions good so thank you i

01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,920
will be anywhere you want me to be if

01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,020
you want to talk about and you want to

01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,000
 about how these things are and i

01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,440
will i'll be happy to listen to your

01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,630
bitching about it and i'll be happy to

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,140
listen to you bitching about me thanks

01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,140
very much for your attention

01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:05,589
by the way it always looks like that

01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:07,089
when I talk so if you if you decide to

01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:08,980
come to another to my thing tomorrow

01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:11,740
I'll just be bitching about a very

01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:19,990
narrow part of what I just complained

01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:22,089
about your customers rely on your

01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:24,490
website or application if it's slower

01:02:22,089 --> 01:02:27,430
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:29,230
and costs you money keeping your

01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:32,750
business critical systems humming along

01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:35,060
requires insight into what they're doing

01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:37,010
your system metrics tells stories

01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:39,020
stories that can reveal performance

01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:41,360
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,920
other problems but how do you keep an

01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,560
eye on all of your systems performance

01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:48,620
metrics in real-time and record this

01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,360
data for later analysis enter longview

01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:52,370
the new way to see what's really going

01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,530
on under the hood the long view

01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:56,600
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:59,060
of all your systems providing you with a

01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:02,420
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:05,000
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,770
load and network usage click a specific

01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,170
system to access its individual

01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:11,680
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:14,090
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,770
comprehensive network data including

01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:18,080
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:19,640
available on the network tab and disk

01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,560
rights and free space on the disk

01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,410
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,930
displays usage statistics for individual

01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:29,120
processes the system info tab shows

01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:31,340
listening services active connections

01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,470
and available updates adding long view

01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,180
to a system is easy just click the

01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:37,310
button copy the one line installation

01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:39,770
command then run the command on your

01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:41,480
linux system to complete the process the

01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:43,640
agent will begin collecting data and

01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,490
sending it to longview then the graph

01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,070
start rolling

01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:50,440
use longview to gain visibility into

01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:54,150
your servers so when your website or app

01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,150
