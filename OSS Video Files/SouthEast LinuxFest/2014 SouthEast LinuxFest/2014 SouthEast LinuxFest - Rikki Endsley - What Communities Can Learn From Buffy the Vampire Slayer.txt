fun little talk but hopefully you'll get

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,030
some community open source community

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,079
tips out of it also I'll start by giving

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,559
you a little information about my

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,149
background I am a tech journalist I my

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,379
area has always been linux and open

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,390
source my first job in open source or

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,320
linux was a sysadmin magazine quite a

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,430
few years ago about 15 years ago and

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,930
before that I had worked in the

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,949
fulfillment department working on all of

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,539
our subscription management and now i'm

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,270
at red hat and i started at red hat in

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,340
February as the community evangelist for

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,170
the open source and standards team which

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,750
means I do their social media basically

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,939
for a bunch of the upstream projects so

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,369
my entire career even though I haven't

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,710
been in a specific community before now

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,689
I guess this is my personal and

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,049
publishing role and I've done a lot of

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,970
observing and so this talk is based on

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,090
some of the observations I've had from

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,020
Buffy my favorite show and communities

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,020
open source communities

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,420
has everyone seen buffy the series is

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,280
there anybody who hasn't okay I'll try

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,380
to fill you in on any of the things that

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,300
you need to know and that I think you

00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,190
can you'll figure it out as you go

00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,810
through this but I didn't see it when it

00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,229
originally aired the first time I saw it

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,360
was on Netflix I'm in the winner of 2011

00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,280
I was living in Lawrence Kansas we had

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,770
very cold winter and I was the middle of

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,780
a divorce so I stayed in and plowed

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,830
through all the Buffy's and then I

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,420
watched again the following winter

00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,040
because we had another really cold

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,899
winter in fact that's the only time I

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,260
missed a business trip was I got snowed

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,780
in from scale in LA so that was even

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,810
worse as I was missing LA and scale and

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,920
I was snowed in then this past winter I

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,930
started watching all of them for the

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,730
third time and but then and it was

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,370
another cold winter and then I moved to

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,540
Austin so I quit watching it in February

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,640
when I moved to Austin and everything

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,080
was much nicer out and I could get

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
outside but this winter it was also

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,769
funny i decided to adopt a kitten and I

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,410
went in to adopt her in the middle of my

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,510
third Buffy series and the first kitten

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:45,380
i saw was named buffy that's how i got

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:47,209
Buffy the wrong way okay so here's a

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,190
joss whedon quote which I think nicely

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,290
describes and the feeling people get in

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,060
open source communities also you have a

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,590
lot of individuals who are working on

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,600
their specific parts of projects but

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,100
ultimately everybody is on some kind of

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,120
a team or in some kind of a community

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,280
and even people i know in open source

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,209
you like to think that they are

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,950
antisocial you know or surly or whatever

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,600
they're always on some kind of a team

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,600
and functioning on some kind of a group

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,269
so buffy is the chosen one she's the

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,130
leader obviously of the buffy the

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,200
vampire slayer series and she's just a

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:27,260
high school student I've seen this a lot

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,360
in open source communities and even

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,850
though open source the essence of open

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,010
sources collaboration cooperation you

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,910
know and everybody has a voice

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,739
ultimately the most effective

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,290
communities tend to have some kind of a

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,709
strong leadership you know system either

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,010
a leader or a team board you know some

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:48,290
kind of a group and I've seen this quite

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,310
a bit in fact a community I wrote an

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,870
article about a couple

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,480
gears no I guess it was last summer and

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,360
they kind of had been rejuvenated and

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,069
part of it was stronger leadership and

00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,700
documentation which I'll also get to

00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:03,830
that's a big part of it but Buffy she

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,680
what she didn't volunteer and you often

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:10,280
see that too and open source communities

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,360
it's not necessarily somebody who had a

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,450
background in management or leadership

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,480
sometimes it's just a natural person who

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,669
is doing leadership you know things and

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,019
everybody took steps back and that

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:23,540
person left standing forward and they

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,820
are somehow running the show that she

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,540
ends up learning a lot on the job which

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,220
you also see in open source communities

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,010
so effective open source community

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,900
leaders and also have to adapt in their

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,680
communities you'll see that they do a

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,840
lot of mentoring and listening is a huge

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,580
thing in open source communities you

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,710
don't tell your communities what to do

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,380
you help them figure out how they want

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,389
to function and then the process they're

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,169
going to set up you know to get their

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:57,169
their goals accomplished having a sense

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:59,180
of humor is a huge part of open source I

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,630
think and people who don't have a sense

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:06,830
of humor and tend to not have leadership

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:09,620
roles or last long you have to have a

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,080
good sense of humor to last an open

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,550
source and to have fun I think most of

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,039
us are here because it is something fun

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,810
and we enjoy we you know very few people

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,680
get rich working in open source usually

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,990
it's a passion of some sort and

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,910
confidence is going to help I would say

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,410
not all open source leaders are actually

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,950
confident a lot of them just appear that

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,470
way and but actually you know it's more

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,900
of a I'll freak out when i get home but

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,110
i'm going to be okay in this IRC channel

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,880
right now and understanding what

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,169
motivates your community members also is

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,500
very important for leadership because

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,870
some people um want public recognition

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,030
whereas other people you know are trying

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,450
to pick up specific skills you know to

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,270
help them in a job you know and so I'm

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:59,030
their various motivations for different

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,080
community members and a lot of open

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,180
source projects end up having

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,370
you know specific programs for

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,669
recognition also I'm a boon to and

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,969
fedora for example and both have systems

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:14,000
for recognizing contributions and being

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:16,620
transparent obviously is very important

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,050
and being inclusive and open source and

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,840
then training future leaders is a big

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,460
part of open source communities because

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,080
generally you don't have the same leader

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,120
in a project forever you know unless

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,030
it's a benevolent dictator type person

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,560
but and most open source projects are

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,860
you know have some kind of a turnaround

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,349
we we recently had a switch and Fedora

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,969
leadership and that was a nice process

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,949
where Robin was ready to pass the torch

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,479
you know and and somebody had already

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,879
been on the project for a while so it's

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:50,250
been a smooth transition so the next

00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,259
part is documentation and as a

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,180
journalist obviously I can't emphasize

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,469
that strongly enough but I think that

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,270
you'll see that not a lot of the most

00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:59,810
successful open source projects they

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,340
also have some excellent documentation

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,629
maybe it's not going to destroy the

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,490
earth if you don't but it could totally

00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:09,900
hurt your project you know not having

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,699
documentation um so some documentation

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,240
tips are you know good read me or

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,589
introduction I've seen this as recently

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,879
as a couple weeks ago when I was looking

00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,830
at a project and I wanted to know more

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,150
about the project and it didn't actually

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,740
have an introduction you know it was

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,779
just you dive right in so if you don't

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,300
know the background of the project you

00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,750
know that that's going to hurt the path

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,069
to entry for newcomers to your community

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,009
having documentation online and with the

00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,389
download some screenshots and examples

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,639
of code and use so that you can

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,339
visualize it it's I definitely work best

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,629
with visuals not just text links and

00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,909
references you know to find out more

00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,379
information because you know most

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,569
projects are also connected to other

00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,509
projects and so having you know easy

00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:54,150
access to the other projects is helpful

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:57,000
and help for the new users and users in

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,279
mind are very closely related and having

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,650
just changelogs that's a huge pet peeve

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,900
of mine it's much more functional to

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,460
have a documentation that reads that you

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,520
can actually read through it it's going

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,569
to help new people get up to speed and

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,919
even people within the community we're

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,180
not going to have to thumb through you

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,680
know figure out your little bits of

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,150
information if you have a nice organized

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,310
doc you

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,330
that was an introduction you know and

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,120
that walks you through the whole process

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,320
and it's going to be much easier for the

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:27,230
newcomers and then for ongoing

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:28,550
membership willow is from the beginning

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,920
for those of you haven't seen the series

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,410
she is a very mousy character at the

00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,050
very beginning of the series very smart

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,520
young high school student and definitely

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,200
not a leader type personality she would

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,610
be the you know one standing in the back

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,070
and people wouldn't realize how smart

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,160
she is necessarily until they get to

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,410
know her but she I picked this quote

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,090
from her in in the series because I

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,430
think it also describes open source very

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,140
well if you think of an intern for

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,710
example who might be on an open source

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,780
project ideally if if you have an intern

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,040
you know you're going to keep them you

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,810
know that's I think most people would

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,270
like to have them stay on if they're

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,800
good intern and this is what you see

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,960
with willow you know she ends up really

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,960
enjoying her high school experience

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,870
working with the Scooby and the gang or

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,180
whatever you know which is the Buffy's

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,280
little group of crime fighters and then

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,620
instead of going away for college she

00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,030
decides to stay locally and really

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,850
devote herself to this team because it's

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,710
a good fight and I think we see that an

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,390
open source where people have interned

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,450
you know and then even after going to

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,070
college or going on to a different job

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,770
perhaps they still contribute to the

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:40,790
open source project in willows case and

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,870
having mentors and was fabulous and she

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,000
went rogue at some point that's what

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,160
this image that's not a good episode I

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,150
mean it's good but it's it was traumatic

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,340
luckily Minter's were able to bring her

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,170
back in but she does become a leader

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,700
she's able to pick up bits of

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,270
information you know and skills from

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:02,420
different mentors so here's some

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,550
mentoring myths and I do have some

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,560
references at the end of the slides and

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,540
these slides will be online also and

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,030
mentoring myth number one is that you

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,920
have to find one perfect mentor and I've

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,870
had quite a few mentors over the years I

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
continue to find new mentors and I you

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,980
know like I've said I've been doing this

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,600
for quite a few years now and there I

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,550
don't think there is such a thing as one

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,680
perfect mentor anyway and the second

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,630
myth is that it's a formal long-term

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,050
relationship I personally have never had

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,720
a four

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,580
mentoring relationship or even somebody

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,330
that I formerly called my mentor you

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,670
know but I do have specific a couple of

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,709
specific managers and a couple of

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,019
editors have been strong interests me

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,610
and several journalists a couple

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,769
community managers and so these are

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,769
people that I've really been able to get

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:50,600
at you know pick information from and

00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:54,019
then actually go to a questions or

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,630
advice over the years mentoring isn't

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,610
just for junior people I have a master's

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,010
degree in journalism but I still pick up

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,600
new editing mentors all the time you

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,310
know and I might not agree with

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,899
everything you know but it's very

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,000
helpful for me to see how other people

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:11,480
are doing things and what works for them

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,860
and so I'm still always learning I think

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,660
if you know if we're not always learning

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,350
at some point you'd get bored and you

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,700
know switch jobs or whatever a bit and

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,899
mentoring isn't something you do just

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,550
throw the goodness of your hearts like i

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,560
said if you're mentoring interns for

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,000
example ultimately you're getting stuff

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,709
out of that too you know maybe you're

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,089
improving your documentation because

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,760
they're pointing out holes you have in

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,020
it or you know you're actually training

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:39,529
somebody who's going to be on your team

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:41,870
and a contributor in the future in an

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,570
open source if you look through any of

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,100
the job listings you know for linux and

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,320
open source jobs programming jobs you

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,790
see a lot of calls for rockstar

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,320
developer and or and the coding ninja or

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,660
whatever and i cringe when i read these

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,240
because to me i really don't want to

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,709
work with rockstar personalities I don't

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,079
want to have to you know fight people's

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:05,120
egos on a project I rather work with

00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,790
people who may I like working with

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,380
strong personalities you know but I want

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,380
to work with people who are good at

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,720
working with groups and you know sharing

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,620
responsibility and sharing credit for

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,740
projects also mmm angel is Buffy's love

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,180
interest early on and I'm sorry to tell

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,680
you she kills him at some point but I

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,040
don't want to spoil it for you but you

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,050
should have seen it by now

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,570
and I was really happy because he annoys

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,490
me and I was never I've never been able

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,500
to get into his spin-off series because

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,300
he's so annoying that's how much I don't

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,440
like the rock star developer personality

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,329
i guess um so yeah rock stars tend to be

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,860
expensive high maintenance unpredictable

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:48,579
attention-seeking and they get credit

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,709
for work that other people do and so if

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:52,300
you're ever doing a job listing you are

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,800
tempted to put rock star on there I

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,870
would rethink it unless you have a giant

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,639
budget and you really want somebody

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,980
who's you know out there getting all the

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,839
attention and open source communities

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,579
tend to be more like a band is how I

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,819
picture them and I used to fedora

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,740
community as an example I I don't really

00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,329
notice you know rock star personalities

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,579
in the Fedora community maybe if you're

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:15,040
deeper in there are some of those but I

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:17,100
really think Fedora is a good example of

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,139
a community that you know shares

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,600
responsibilities and and credit at the

00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,100
end you know and even when r l 7 was

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,250
released really recently I saw the

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,040
several that mean developers on it you

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,510
know our leaders on the project and

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,480
giving shoutouts to fedora he now the

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,389
floor community because Fedora is a good

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,350
example of a community sharing in their

00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:43,690
successes also and then also an open

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,399
source communities and generally and

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,260
it's wonderful if you're also

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,720
contributing to other projects you know

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,190
and you see that in bands also you know

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:58,000
where your musicians look over court on

00:13:51,190 --> 00:14:00,279
other albums spike is supposed to be a

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,699
villain I guess at some point early on

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:06,399
and Buffy he's he might be my favorite

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:10,510
character he and willow her role clothes

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,160
and but spike he is a good example of a

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,889
former community member open source

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,839
community member and sometimes when you

00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:21,149
see community members leave an open

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:25,689
source project you also see them leave

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:27,399
very not good terms you know I if you're

00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,319
lucky they you know are just moving on

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,610
to a different project sometimes you see

00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,680
them leave and they'll be very verbal

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,060
about why this was a bad community not

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,760
just for them but why it's dysfunctional

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,440
and I think that's what happened with

00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,610
Spike he

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,380
is a nice human and he is driven out of

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,180
a very unfriendly community to become a

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:51,340
vampire and they welcomed him into their

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:53,830
community so I think the spike shows us

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,290
some nice examples of how you can lose

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,630
community members and not valuing

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,630
contributions is a great way to lose

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,520
community members and I think open

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,290
source communities narrow are better

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,780
about recognizing contributions that in

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:12,790
the past we're taking for granted

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:14,650
documentation for example and you know

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,270
fixing bugs you know that's actually a

00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,710
huge contribution you know anyone who

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,300
said to deal with a little tiny pesky

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,020
bug the one person who can fix it that's

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,390
a big contribution don't help community

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,860
members improve you know that's another

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,810
great way to lose community member if

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,610
they're just getting criticism for how

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,500
bad they are as opposed to getting you

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,880
know and this could have been improved

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,770
by doing this this is this and some

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,410
mentoring along the way and you're going

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,780
to stare at community members off not

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,630
recognizing efforts and a lot of stuff

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,130
goes on that isn't even noticed and so

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,830
it's very good if you're able to pick up

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,350
and you know give props to people in

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,960
your community for their efforts even if

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,020
they aren't huge successes and they need

00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,690
to be polished fostering a hostile

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,300
environment you know allowing trolls you

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,710
know or dysfunctional community members

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,590
to stay in the community that's a good

00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,450
way to scare off people and do give them

00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,530
all these reasons to move on to other

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,150
projects because there are other

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,190
projects that will be happy to have your

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:16,690
community members if you're not going to

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:20,260
you know work to keep them closely tied

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,030
to all of this is glory and she is the

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,740
big bad in one season she's the most

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,710
wonderful villain ever she's horrible

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,250
and awesome and she's a great example of

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,650
a toxic personality in the community I

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,060
did it it's I think almost every

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,550
community has some kind of toxic

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,290
personality and you know he's doing

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,720
something to cause rifts within the

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:46,320
community and this is a great quote that

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,320
really kind of sums up her personality

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,940
and there's a wonderful presentation I

00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,850
watched the video this week actually

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,980
online it's Donny birkholz from red monk

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,560
has given the talked several times and

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,510
so you can find various YouTube videos

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,570
for it in his talk is are

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:09,000
ruining your project and so he talked

00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:11,730
about his experience on the gentoo

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,740
project and how they were able to track

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:18,090
a drop off in commits to an increase in

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,760
complaints about a couple of specific

00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,440
community members and so this is a

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,570
wonderful talk i highly recommend that

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,940
you see it because he points out that

00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,740
not only that were these couple of

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,810
people scaring away you know people in

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,430
the community and chasing them off but

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,990
then it takes a while for a community to

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,390
recover because they've already

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,130
established a reputation at that point

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,330
you know for being hostile even if it

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,430
was just the one or two annoying people

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,860
so talk toxic personalities there's um i

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,420
have a link to an article here at that

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,000
and also that but some of the highlights

00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,010
from the article was that they do

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,410
distract from the goal and they become

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:59,190
just a distraction on the project they

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:01,650
mostly drain participants glory actually

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,510
sucked the brain energy out of people

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,790
and just like me them brain dead and and

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,010
that's kind of what toxic personalities

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,630
can do to community and they cause a lot

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,310
of needless conflict you know it's just

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,600
not something anyone wants to have to

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,150
deal with is constantly putting out this

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,880
you know one person who's causing some

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,980
kind of conflict and they can slow down

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,380
the progress on any kind of a project

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,850
and they chase off community members you

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,040
can have you can lose quite a few

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,100
community members over one you know bad

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,060
personality on the team and the article

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,340
and that I lead to in here at the end

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,770
what one way they talked about I'm

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,930
actually it was it was also a talk at

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,840
the end it's a some people at Google

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,450
gave a talk on these toxic personalities

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,830
they call them poison personalities and

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,270
you know one of the suggestions they had

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,710
is learning to just ignore these

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,480
personalities i personally don't think

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,910
you should ignore a toxic personality on

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,200
the community ever if you're i don't

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,790
think you immediately jump to kicking

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,740
them off you know but i do think it's

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,230
something that you work on addressing

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,240
and you know giving them a chance to

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,309
and change their understand what

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,809
behavior is causing conflict and then

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,120
change it but i don't think that

00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:15,330
ignoring a toxic person is ever going to

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,669
help your community so Anya is another

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,710
one my favorite characters and if you

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:21,179
haven't seen the show she the first

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,450
image here is when she appears as a

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:26,910
vengeance demon and so she is she would

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,440
be an example of perhaps somebody who

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,540
enters the community as a toxic

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,790
personality but actually it's just a bad

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,980
communicator and once they have better

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,419
communication skills they're able to

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,669
stay and be functional part of the

00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:43,650
community and even maybe endearing and

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,669
communications within communities open

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,340
source communities can be very tricky

00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,780
because often we don't even meet the

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,000
people that we're talking to online and

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,710
working with right and I mean I have

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,770
community their team members that are

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,090
located all over the world or or if

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,900
you're traveling you know you're just

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,040
communicating in IRC or via email and if

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,010
you're dealing with people from

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,390
different countries you know maybe their

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,880
native language isn't the same language

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,110
you know that the communication is very

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,179
different like I said I'm from the

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:18,059
Midwest and people they aren't direct

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:20,730
and they have to they're just it's weird

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,410
they did they're very flowery and the

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,260
way they say stuff so that if you're not

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,059
from the Midwest you might not know what

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,309
they're even actually saying they might

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,410
be saying I really hate this and instead

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:34,710
it came out as oh yeah that's a really

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:38,250
you know nice effort or whatever and so

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,260
that's you know one of the common things

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,730
you'll see I when I worked at lenox new

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,559
media for example you know we're in the

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,490
Kansas office in new Kansas office and

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:49,220
the parent company was in Munich and

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,260
luckily we all liked each other you know

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,700
because otherwise and we were able to

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,169
laugh about the communication

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,570
differences you know just the cultural

00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:00,120
differences and we even would play jokes

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,250
on each other you know and Americans are

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,919
known for having guns everywhere you

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,340
know and whereas Germans you know would

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,169
stick in nude statues as art in the

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,850
magazine just to freak us out a note and

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:14,100
then we'd realize it was a joke they

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,929
weren't really trying to you know but

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,809
and Americans seem to be more uptight

00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,280
about nudity and okay with guns so I'm

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,200
anyway those are some of the cultural

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,080
differences and so Anya really struggles

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,090
with that in the Buffy series where her

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,450
conflict is often just because she

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:32,070
doesn't communicate like everybody else

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:34,860
and despite having a communications

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,110
background and I can I can really relate

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,750
to Anya because I communicate great in

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:44,270
writing and it's it's in person that I

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,500
tend to have my fallout and hmm so I

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:50,760
collected some tips for communication

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:54,659
and for online and in person and having

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,960
one conversation at a time I have that

00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,700
problem when I'm you know in in person

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,049
you know in if I'm not just looking at

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,580
that one person and other people are

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,980
trying to talk it's very hard for me to

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,169
even you know to focus and have a

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,679
conversation so looking people in the

00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:12,150
eye is is a great way to do it in person

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,270
but even online i'm having challenges

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,190
with that in my RC you know and where

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,250
you're supposed to be keeping track of

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,770
the community and then your work IRC and

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,059
then you know see it's exhausting and i

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,799
don't know how to fix that yet for

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,409
myself because I haven't really had to

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,090
work on IRC before you know going to

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,039
redhead I've avoided I've you know I

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,150
knew about it and people kept telling me

00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,429
I needed to be there and I kept saying

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,950
no that's not going to be good for me

00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:41,010
and I'm still I have to figure out how

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,690
to do that in fact I've had I've had one

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,240
colleague call me a couple times and say

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,460
did you not see the questions on IRC no

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,580
i didn't i was working i don't know how

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,409
you do this you know writing things down

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,539
i have to write everything down I can't

00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:56,909
just type it if I need to remember it I

00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,400
need to write it down and that helps me

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:02,190
remember whatever I've agreed to or

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,929
talked about with somebody reading a

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,640
responding to an entire email I'm really

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,289
bad about that if it's a long email and

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,090
I'll do a speed read and get a couple

00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:10,679
things out and then I've actually missed

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,539
major things and I'll ask stupid

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,870
questions later and it was long email

00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:18,690
that I did a speed read on and creating

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,190
response schedules went one tip I

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,299
haven't done that yet I think that's

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:25,710
going to be very good for me probably

00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:28,289
with email and assuming best intentions

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,730
my very first job and even before I

00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,640
started sysadmin but it was at Miller

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,200
Freeman which was the company that

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,789
published this admin when I worked in

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,070
fulfillment I remember my very first day

00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,620
on the job the HR person who was giving

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,970
me a tour I just remember it stood out

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,230
she said the culture here is that we

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,230
always assume people have the best

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,779
intentions and that has really helped me

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,520
my entire career and I wish everybody

00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:54,570
would go into every conflict like that

00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,029
even in IRC or well especially in IRC I

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,770
think that email and in person you know

00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:01,020
you see a lot of conflicts online where

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,630
people assume somebody meant something a

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,600
certain way and that might may not be it

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,860
at all or the way they said it yeah you

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,940
know maybe that's what they meant but

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,130
then when we had time to think about it

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,770
that's not what they really meant to say

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,840
so assuming best intentions the very

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,120
beginning is going to help in any kind

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,820
of a communication difference and then

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,120
closing the loop and I have to do this

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,279
after our conference calls if we've

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,830
agreed to do anything I Bri Pete back or

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,360
you know in even if we've had them the

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,669
conference call with etherpad it's all

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,960
so complicated but you know I'll be okay

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,460
these are the takeaways right this is

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,470
what we've agreed on this is you know

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,120
who's doing what and here's the deadline

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,370
he now and putting that all in writing

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:47,090
helps me close the loop and make sure

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:51,510
that we're all on the same page um

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:53,070
Xander is the generalist so he's a high

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,590
school friend of Buffy's in the whole

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,289
gang and he ends up not going on to

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,309
college he's kind of you know right

00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,010
after high school he doesn't go to

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:03,149
college and he kind of tries out some

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,340
different things to figure out what he

00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:07,169
wants to do and so he picks up a bunch

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,029
of different skills you know but he

00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:10,830
doesn't really specialize in any one

00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:14,250
thing he's not a witch like willow and

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,779
he's not the Slayer you know and he's

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,460
not a route you know former vengeance

00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:19,080
demon or a librarian or whatever he's

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,260
just still trying to figure it out he's

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,299
been a bartender and handyman and

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,610
whatever and so am i this bits quote was

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,289
really very beautiful the Buffy series

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,149
it was very beautiful episode he's

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,520
comforting Buffy's sister who doesn't

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:34,110
feel like she's any of her contributions

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,929
or recognized or appreciated you know

00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,990
and and this is it's a very beautiful

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,320
theme because

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,610
he is saying you know that generalists

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,220
aren't out and open they don't get seen

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:48,070
you know they don't people don't know

00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,720
what they're doing you know and it

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,690
reminds me of I went to Cabo a couple

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,220
summers ago with six nurses and I

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,870
remember we were all on the beach and

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,570
some you know cute boy came up and was

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,100
talking to one of them and and she's

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,500
like yeah we're all nurses except for

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,059
her we don't know what she does that was

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,679
me you know and because I'd said I'm

00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,210
associate publisher of you know linux

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,650
pro at the time and they're like what

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,820
and what does the publisher do whoa

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,740
anything that anyone else isn't doing

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,550
was what I was supposed to do and so

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,510
that's a generalist for you generalists

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,740
are actually very good to have on your

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,559
team particularly if you have a small

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,179
team and it works very well when i

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:27,100
joined linux new media we were opening

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:30,640
the first well the only north american

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,550
office and and like I said our parent

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,290
office was in Munich and but because I

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,580
had a bunch of weird different skill set

00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,080
that works very well since we're gonna

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,840
have a very tiny team there was two of

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,420
us the editor in chief and me and I'm i

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,870
had a managing editor background but I

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,610
also could you know build a website a

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:53,110
simple website on my webmaster but um

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:56,700
and I could design a magazine I could

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:59,679
manage an office you know edit right and

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,790
you know but and I i dapped a while to

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,580
change I worked very well under pressure

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,080
that worked out well for us I was able

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,900
to pick up new skills quickly I enjoyed

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,450
that and you know and I love the variety

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,870
and learning on the job those are also

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:15,610
some challenges to it like I said it's

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:18,190
very hard to show what you're doing if

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,530
you're doing a whole bunch of you know

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:23,710
little things as opposed to if I'm just

00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:27,730
managing a website and updating it you

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,350
know I that's harder to show if you know

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,940
if the news just shows up every day on

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,800
their well I actually wrote it and

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,450
posted it you know but it's not the same

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,640
as rolling out a whole website you know

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:41,679
and learning on the job as it can also

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,270
you know be hard because if you're busy

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,530
trying to pick up skills maybe you

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,760
aren't producing at the same time or

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,980
whatever you're supposed to be doing and

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,020
so it can certainly take longer to

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,720
perform jobs like I said I can design a

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,240
magazine

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,490
you know from the beginning and I'm not

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,600
gonna be fast out of the ho and it's

00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,880
probably not going to be technically

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,400
perfect as if I were a regular designer

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,770
but if our regular designer was short on

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,360
time and needed me to do some stuff that

00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:09,080
she could just polish at the end that's

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,340
where the skill came in handy but what's

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,049
right on the resume if you're a

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,669
generalist can also be very tricky which

00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,010
is why I custom write my resume for any

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,480
position I was applying for because if I

00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,520
was applying for and you know community

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,809
management position those would be the

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,929
experiences I would want to make sure I

00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:25,100
highlighted as opposed to you know being

00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:27,169
an editor and that would be the same

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,030
thing if you can do some programming and

00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:31,520
then some you know community management

00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,289
or whatever you would have different

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,570
versions of your resume and cover letter

00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:40,309
and the t-shaped generalist is something

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,970
that I hadn't really heard about before

00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:47,000
until recently and this is something

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,919
that employers tend to like more than

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,669
just a generalist somebody who has some

00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:55,309
a couple of drinks but then experience

00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:56,750
so you know you've you can do a bunch of

00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:59,120
these things you have the skill set that

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:06,730
you're really strong in you know python

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:08,510
or them you know fixing bugs or whatever

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,679
finding bugs that no one else has ever

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:18,140
seen it's what I'm good at but that

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:20,840
doesn't look good on my resume um if you

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:24,110
seen buffy remember this episode hush

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,200
might be the best episode of all and it

00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:29,919
had see I think the 17 minutes of

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,740
dialogue in a 44-minute long episode and

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,020
the gentleman were the villains that

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,570
came in and they stole everybody's

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,400
voices and so the whole episode was

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,110
pretty silent you know in people writing

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,950
on little boards and doing some very

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:47,480
funny hand gestures to communicate and

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,280
so it was really creepy episode you know

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,760
but it had some moments of humor too but

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,870
that episode and the gentleman made me

00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,460
think of harassment in our community and

00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,720
you know I hear some people who will say

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,690
they're tired of hearing about it you

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,800
know and that's great we all are because

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,020
we're tired of it happening

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,370
you know and it still happens having

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,930
been in this field a long time I can

00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,430
tell you that it is better you know I

00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,160
haven't had anybody tell me to read the

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,890
 manual and more than a decade

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,760
and that's nice instead now they're

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,100
talking about why don't you write a

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,960
better man you want you know or as I

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,480
told somebody well if it was intuitive

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,950
you know and your user interface was

00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,250
more friendly I wouldn't have to go read

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:30,710
the manual so speaking up is not always

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,430
possible with harassment and this

00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:39,770
episode you know nicely Illustrated that

00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:41,540
I I had I one time in particular that

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,120
where I was harassed online by some

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,190
4chan people and I you know I was able

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,570
to you know sleuth out which channel

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,640
they were on and where they were

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,130
plotting how to harass me and you know

00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,110
sharing my email address and and but

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,390
then I also saw that they were eagerly

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,920
awaiting my public response you know

00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,210
because it was in response to a blog i

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,730
had written and so they were inundated

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:04,490
with you know these really nasty quotes

00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,780
you know and then what started off you

00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,970
know what get in the kitchen to make me

00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,920
a sandwich it always starts that way but

00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,750
then it then it got really graphic and

00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,980
and the emails were they were very

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:18,650
upsetting you know but um I I handled it

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,510
in a way that I felt comfortable with I

00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:22,700
shut down all the comments on all of our

00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:25,190
sites in English worldwide so they all

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,010
were they had to be him you know

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,330
previewed and approved after that and

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,500
all the bloggers actually were very

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,910
happy about it I was the only female

00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,820
bloggers at the time but the guys were

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,350
all like thank you you know and to this

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,090
day I think they still have that where

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,680
you have to approve comments because I

00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,720
also feel like we were setting a tone

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,310
you know for our site and I wanted to be

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,310
a friendly you know place where people

00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,900
could leave intelligent comments and

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,070
those would stay up and then see how

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,600
much comments would not get approved and

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,750
but yeah with harassment people just

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,920
always can't talk about it and you know

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:02,120
workplace sexual harassment that's very

00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,040
tricky thing for people to to discuss so

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,990
when you're thinking you know well our

00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,160
team's a great team or our communities a

00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,560
great community I've never seen

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,450
harassment or I've never heard about it

00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,190
keep in mind that it still might be

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,650
going on and so if somebody else is

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,420
talking about it and you know saying

00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,680
I never hear about it it's not saying

00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,950
anything at all because you might not

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,660
hear about it and still be going on and

00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,510
talking about if you're harassed by

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,520
somebody at work for example if this

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,980
person's well-liked you have the

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,250
potential of losing allies at your job

00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,290
you know and hurting yourself when it

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,420
comes to being promoted or even staying

00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,340
on a team you know and often it's the

00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,290
person who reports it the ends up having

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,940
the fallout as opposed to person who

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:51,810
actually is doing the harassing online

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:53,400
harassment is even worse it and you

00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,590
would think I mean people I see it all

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,330
the time just ignore you know ignore it

00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,560
well that's okay to say unless these

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,300
people are saying of some really

00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,870
disturbing things I mean you get threads

00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,980
you know and unless you've had those and

00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,450
you just don't realize you feel

00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,920
differently when it's directed at you

00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,480
and you have somebody threatening to

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,330
come to your home and do horrible things

00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,320
to you whether or not you think they

00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,880
know where you live or they'd actually

00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,150
follow through is still very disturbing

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,070
and generally these people online aren't

00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,410
using their real names and I don't know

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,940
if they ever do and whereas they are you

00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,950
know my name is out there you know my

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,180
phone number my email and you know

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,830
because generally people aren't doing

00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:33,930
this to me but then you have these them

00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:35,580
online harasser xand again you you know

00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,530
people just don't always talk about it

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,800
and I'm seeing this gone and some

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:45,360
communities online right now the online

00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,560
harassment and like I said it's getting

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,920
better but we still have a long way to

00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:52,200
go when it comes to harassment but I

00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,700
didn't want to end on that because I

00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,020
that was her originally to send it nice

00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,640
like wow that's a bummer and because

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,770
this was not supposed to be like that at

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,290
all and buff he's a really wonderful

00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:04,890
show and so I do end with another

00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:07,200
villain but Adam for those of you who

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:10,050
have seen this series and is a great

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,710
example of close source development Adam

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:17,070
is created you know in in back rooms of

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:19,649
a lab and very only a couple people know

00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,000
that he's being built you know and he's

00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,490
supposed to be the most perfect whatever

00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,419
and so when they go to fight him they

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,860
don't even know what they're dealing

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:27,750
with they don't even know how he was

00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,320
built or what all you know bilities he

00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,540
has though

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,860
I thought he was a nice example and then

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,090
when I looked for quotes I found the one

00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,960
where he says I seem to have a design

00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:38,100
flaw and I said god that's perfect and

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,220
so that was the last one I had and that

00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,570
if anybody had other examples of you

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,890
know because when I'm when I'm seeing

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,910
shows like this or I wrote an article

00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:50,670
one morning and if your if your dog was

00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:52,440
a linux you know or if your linux was a

00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,490
dog which breed would it be and I wrote

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,900
that in my head one morning having

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,670
coffee and so if you're like me and

00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,100
watching Buffy thinking oh that reminds

00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,810
me of I would love to hear any other

00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:07,800
suggestions you have of characters I

00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:08,970
left out any ideas nope well for those

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,860
of you who haven't seen buffy i

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,430
encourage you to it's still on netflix

00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:17,210
and and it's awesome so and thank you

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,210
for coming to my talk

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,920
you

00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,810
your customers rely on your website or

00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,210
application if it's slower

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:03,150
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,950
and costs you money keeping your

00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,470
business critical systems humming along

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:10,780
requires insight into what they're doing

00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,730
your system metrics tells stories

00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,740
stories that can reveal performance

00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,080
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,640
other problems but how do you keep an

00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,280
eye on all of your systems performance

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,340
metrics in real-time and record this

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,080
data for later analysis enter longview

00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,090
the new way to see what's really going

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,250
on under the hood the long view

00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:32,320
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:34,780
of all your systems providing you with a

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,140
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,720
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,490
load and network usage click a specific

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,890
system to access its individual

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,400
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:49,810
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,490
comprehensive network data including

00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,800
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,359
available on the network tab and disk

00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,280
rights and free space on the disk

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,130
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,650
displays usage statistics for individual

00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:04,840
processes the system info tab shows

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,060
listening services active connections

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,220
and available updates adding long view

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,900
to a system is easy just click the

00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,060
button copy the one line installation

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,490
command then run the command on your

00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,200
linux system to complete the process the

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,390
agent will begin collecting data and

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,230
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,780
start rolling

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,150
use longview to gain visibility into

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:29,890
your servers so when your website or app

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,890
