00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:28,650
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,869
videos possible alright everybody thank

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,730
you for coming to the hands on arms our

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,399
speakers jason plum he is a core

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,989
developer for arch linux arm senior

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,160
software engineer Devon IT obviously my

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,320
introduction is pretty much already

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,930
covered there i'm going to go ahead and

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,730
go over some things at this talk that

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,379
cover real-world usage and

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,570
implementations and some of the things

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,520
you may have seen it may not realize or

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,559
running arm and then the things that

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,140
we're looking at using it for down the

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,600
road that consumers may not directly see

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:07,049
but hackers and people interested may

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,340
actually see a little about me naturally

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,810
i'm one of those curious people when I

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,909
see something and I don't understand

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,680
natural just by looking at it how it

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,470
works the first thing I want to do is I

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,890
want to tear it apart now why does that

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,930
matter because of that I'm not afraid of

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,369
a soldering iron which means I don't

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,259
have a problem accidentally breaking

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,090
something if I can then fix its

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:33,060
electronics later on okay again how does

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,810
that matter well one day I'm sitting

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,799
there in my windows IT admin job

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,409
currently working on a little perl

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,920
script to run against our Oracle server

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,409
running on Windows to manage some mfc

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,659
applications back-end database and I'm

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,200
flipping around and I see an article on

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,270
lifehacker about using a pogoplug this

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,939
device I hadn't heard about and a USB

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,920
key to serve out all the media you have

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,399
in your house through mini DLNA and

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,969
samba now the reason I thought this was

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,580
interesting is that at my house I had

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,120
two TVs and three blu-ray players that

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,830
all had either samba or DLNA and thus if

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,330
I had one access point where I can

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,430
get all of my media throughout my house

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,950
it would be great I can store all line

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,450
hardware in one location and it would

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,520
just be there instead of me having to

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,500
deal with all this because at the time I

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,930
just had my laptop I didn't have a

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,830
desktop that I just left their lives in

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,600
apartment and it was kind of a problem

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,240
so I went and I looked at this but I

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,800
found this article a little late when I

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,240
found the article there was a new

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,340
version of the pogoplug coming out

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,680
called the pogoplug pro and this one had

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,780
Wi-Fi in it which was great because my

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,810
apartment on top of that I was not

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,310
allowed to wire and it had no wires

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,170
pretty sure my girlfriend wouldn't have

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,270
liked it so I went out I bought this

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,830
device as soon as it came out I'm like

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,820
yeah he's going to have y flag took all

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,400
my stuff up to it I didn't know buying

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:10,800
this device would ruin my spare time for

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:13,380
years to come now it turns out that this

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,940
particular device when the manufacturer

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,459
made it they decided to change out the

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,110
chip on the inside instead of having the

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,300
standard and stock that we've seen for

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,280
many years which is a marvel kirkwood

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,769
one point to the same thing that's in a

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,739
Shiva plug that's in early versions of

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,680
the Guru plug as well as a doc star and

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,430
a couple of consumer Nass devices like

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,200
the nsl you two or the slug they decided

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,800
to put a chip in there from a company

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,870
called plx now this happened to have a

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,489
dual issue processor it happen to have a

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,260
natural SATA connection but they were

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:53,519
only using USB but you can't run the

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,769
colonel from this sock on that sock so

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,450
before just sticking in the USB key and

00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,610
ignoring all of the warnings and doing

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,040
it anyways I decided that's a weird

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,620
warning I'm going to look so i crack it

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,739
open and turned out sure enough here's a

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,130
PCIe connected Wi-Fi and a completely

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,320
dif aachen why is there a sate important

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,630
so I look around I realized this is not

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,500
going to work at all so I got involved

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,209
with what was then at the time plug apps

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,900
right about the time it was preparing to

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,120
change from plug box to that

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,160
now at the time we didn't have the

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,540
colonel sources because cloud engines

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,490
hadn't released it so I didn't have

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,320
Colonel sources I didn't have any

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,850
drivers I didn't have any of this fun

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,110
stuff that I can actually go and open

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:44,220
the box really up but I could use a

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,780
Schrute so I managed to do this route

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,460
get that all configured and document it

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,169
well enough and a couple of wiki pages

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:55,680
later it's my fault now it's my job to

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,419
maintain this and deal with it and that

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,370
is the beginning of where I we got

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,510
involved with what is now arch linux arm

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,870
and eventually became a core developer

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:09,300
now the result of all that and wasting

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,550
all of my free time ok not all of it but

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,310
a lot of it for many years and probably

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,440
many years to come is that I now have a

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,139
full-time job in free and open source

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,550
software and honestly I can tell you is

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,900
the happiest time in my career ever I

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,660
really enjoyed it and if you can manage

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,330
to figure it out and working with Linux

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,580
and other open source projects is really

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,099
something you would like to do pursue it

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,930
take the step and don't be afraid to not

00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:39,090
have a piece of paper that says I don't

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,240
know because if you're in this field you

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,930
know who knows and who doesn't the paper

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,930
doesn't tell you anything

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,370
now I've getting separate talks and

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,770
every single one of them has some pun in

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,110
the name I do apologize for example

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:03,550
we're dealing with hands-on arms the

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:07,120
last one was the evolution revolution of

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,070
arms and the one before that was some

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,100
take on a pie what I call a slice of pie

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,740
I think they're usually pretty accurate

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,100
so I do apologize for messing with your

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,540
schedule and puns that might be bad so

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,270
let's take an example from the beginning

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,060
of what people might know about this one

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,040
and its variations listed is one of the

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,500
first ones that people really saw on the

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,840
market as available as a small linux

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,880
server they could really get into and

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,060
dig around it that happens to be running

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,370
an ARM chip the Shiva plug is from

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,710
global scale it was then rebranded in

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,470
multiple forms pogoplug used it for the

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,990
very first pogoplug tonita plug used it

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,250
for their first two nieto plug all they

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,870
did was go okay I'm going to take this

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,370
port off or I'm going to add more memory

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,910
and I'm going to just reduce the amount

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,200
of inboard storage and then if you've

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,350
been following anything with penetration

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,940
testing you have the pony plug basically

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,490
they took the exact same thing we've

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,560
been seeing for years took the Linux

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,470
that was there added some penetration

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,690
testing and security tool kits you now

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,160
have a drop in box that's low power that

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:19,270
if you modify kid work with a battery

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,190
and then you get to the now just jumping

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,200
straight ahead places that we're now

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,410
aware that these are at that they're

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,080
interesting places at home you have them

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,770
in small nass devices like the pogoplug

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,810
like the Buffalo makes a couple of small

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,370
hard drives that have the cloud ready

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,560
and then there's also Western Digital's

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,460
my home and have people of variations as

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,200
well as instances like the airport

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,790
express that has the indoor inbound

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,270
storage that's actually running an arm

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:52,000
sock but there's also ones that are

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,180
available for small home in office such

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,910
as qnap NASA's that's one of the ones

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,919
you get 48 these costs four or five six

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,880
thousand dollars and get you high raid

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,100
performance but in the end

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,830
they're actually running an arm sock on

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,440
the inside until you hit the medium size

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,080
business and need a 10 12 13 thousand

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,450
dollar unit and you have big business

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,360
who are now experimenting with doing

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:20,210
high density low power clustering with

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,180
arm servers the key there being if you

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,640
don't need high compute for their needs

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,620
you need to have fast I oh and be able

00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,020
to get to and from ram but answer simple

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,530
questions which how much of the web is a

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,599
simple question just repeat it a lot

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,640
then you can easily do this and take the

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,160
load that you have with one box and

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,060
catching a million hits and split into

00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,970
10 to take tenth of the power that catch

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,700
a hundred thousand each then you have

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,670
the Denslow power clustering in the real

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,700
enterprise-class that you get with the

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,740
project moonshot that both HP and a

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,140
similar project but differently name

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,750
from dell are exploring the high end of

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,070
the arm seven ships on a server scale as

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,760
well as the arm v8 ships for actual

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,210
implementation by companies like

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,140
Microsoft Google Facebook anybody that

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,120
has to do high density high-performance

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,980
memory but not necessarily compute

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,320
intensive applications in consumers we

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,700
all know our phones have them by now if

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,710
you don't you're probably running MIPS

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,740
and you might be running like an S 600

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,380
or something but it's also now in

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,090
laptops there's a couple markets that we

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,980
don't see here in the US but the ones

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,620
that we do see are the Chromebooks from

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,690
samsung and google you have a Chromebook

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,140
one Chromebook too and that even has two

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,660
variations now some people say these are

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,610
underpowered I tend to disagree if

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,130
you're trying to watch for youtube

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:56,330
videos beyond clout Google+ Facebook

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:59,300
Twitter and say 15 pages of tumblr that

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,110
auto feed you might want to learn how to

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,930
use a browser but and then you also have

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,060
them in TVs these are the places where

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,530
you do see them where people in the

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,600
technical world do you see them and

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,000
where the consumer may see them but not

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,790
understand that the ARM chips are not

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,010
actually

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,130
these are implementations commercially

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,320
done and supported where this is the

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,090
target and this is where an interesting

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,980
piece of hardware comes in if you want

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,230
to see the internals because it's not

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,540
the same thing as every laptop you buy

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:35,460
off the shelf of Microsoft now I am

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,330
running through this a little faster

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,730
than I expected but let me slow myself

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,710
down here for a minute what kind of

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,080
projects would you be interested in

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,850
doing I have a couple of them with me

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,700
today and I have a couple examples of

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,020
what's actually been done as well as a

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,560
couple that unfortunately didn't quite

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,050
make it here but where and why would you

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,270
pick a specific item for your project

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,040
and where you're going to get the board

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,990
or the housing and everything it's

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,240
already done if you want to do your own

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,300
home Nass but the features that are

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,450
available on the market today don't

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,940
match what you want to do you want to

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,310
have a linux-based one this has rate and

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,290
you want have a decent enclosure but

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,860
everything you look at has raid but it's

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,570
an x FS and it most is raid one you can

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,520
take most of those boxes that cost

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,190
anywhere from fifty to two hundred

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,900
dollars and change it out so that you're

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,360
running a full linux distribution

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,900
instead of a targeted embedded reduced

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,140
set and you can run engine X you can run

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,470
apache my sequel postgrads anything in

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,850
the linux tack can be run on arm that's

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,490
the case where you actually want to take

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,850
a commercial product opener up and get

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,170
full access to those so for example we

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,180
have a few of those which is the

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,740
pogoplug very popular for that purpose

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,170
as well as some of those i sell nass

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,060
devices like the NSA 320 I have back on

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,190
my table it's perfect example because

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,650
they've designed it specifically to take

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,230
three and a half inch hard drives two of

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,380
them up to four terabytes at that plug

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,910
them right in and have it done and 512

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,550
megs of ram you get to play with gigabit

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:18,870
ethernet three USB ports and all that's

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:22,740
bigger brother you even get USB 3 sure

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,880
you pay 150 dollars for that version and

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,750
a hundred dollars for the one I have on

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,470
my table but if you choose to use that

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,270
you

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,940
still use the stock by simply rebooting

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,750
into that and you get twonky and some

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,570
basic services Samba NFS and I believe

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,460
they have AFP working on that choose to

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,620
run linux on that and you have

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,980
everything that's available i happen to

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,470
use one of them for Amash ssh and VPN

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,790
gateway for which on that i leave a

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,770
screen session running that's always

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,200
running my wechat i never have to pay

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:58,710
for a VPS it cost me about forty cents a

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,390
month big difference then leaving my

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,280
desktop on which cost me about 40 bucks

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:08,790
a lot i really need to stop doing that

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:10,740
and then you have things for developer

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,690
board uses like big ol ball and black

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,940
everybody knows the Raspberry Pi and

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,440
many of the Olmecs boards that actually

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,660
have on display at my table but not that

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,390
many people know about in those cases

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,930
you have uses where you want to use them

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:26,910
for a robotics project or a UAV I know

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,070
of a group that's actually creating a

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,500
UAV specifically made for penetration

00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,500
testing that runs on the BeagleBone

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,780
black unfortunately it didn't make it

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,070
here today or I would have it flying

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:43,410
around above your heads for the heck of

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:45,300
it but such is and then when you get to

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,560
the point that you are beyond working

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,020
with the developer board you actually

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,670
want to make a commercial product or you

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,320
just want to take that leap and build a

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,660
board specifically to your own design

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,990
there are custom design houses that will

00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,350
work with you and make these boards that

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,850
match exactly to what you need omx for

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,950
example isn't completely open source

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,960
hardware provider but they do also board

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,300
design and integration services should

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,940
you ever choose to do that another one

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,950
is boundary devices out of america and

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:19,010
they do a lot of work with the imx6

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:21,180
series versus the all winter series now

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,550
examples of custom designs that have

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,080
obviously been done already is there's a

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,170
company in japan called open blocks

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,570
plaque home is what they do and this is

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,570
actually an industrial designed arm

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,310
server this is set up for a very wide

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:39,000
scale scale of temperatures for

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,190
operation humidity's everything it's got

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,980
a power supply that very much resembles

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,880
a brick from a lap

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,980
but they need to make sure that they

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,130
have a properly grounded isolated and

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,990
handled power supply the heatsink on

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:55,830
this guy is a full wraparound and is

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,200
designed to operate between 20 and 120

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,090
degrees obviously it's a fairly wide

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,710
scale and my max actually might be a

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,890
little low depending on if I'm supposed

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:08,460
to be in Celsius or not this has four

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,410
gigabit ethernet an industrial slc SSD

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,700
so you can write the daylights out of

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,600
this thing and it will live for a very

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,250
long time one gig of ram on board you

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,280
can expand it out two three even with a

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,730
sodium and it can actually go ahead and

00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,670
take an eSATA expansion to a seder raid

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,430
if you wanted to there's many other

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,720
designs up there I have several that are

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,670
actually done and I can give you an

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,160
example because the company that I now

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:38,010
work for hired me because of this custom

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,450
design this is actually a thin client

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,010
that most people would see and go oh

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,530
well there's an android version of that

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,550
that is done to make a media consumption

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:49,800
stick yes very true in this case we've

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,990
taken it created a thin client based

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,810
entirely on Linux with all the

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,100
acceleration stack and gets us

00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,170
certification with all the major thin

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,830
client applications out there for remote

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:04,550
access so we have Citrix vmware rdp the

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,550
entire stack

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:16,450
so maybe a couple of examples of what we

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,550
actually do I have a couple of them here

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,280
with me today I have a couple that I can

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,950
easily tell you about and one of those

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,920
in the example who here is heard of the

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:29,020
pie brew anybody hear about that one

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,250
yeah anybody interested in beer and

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,360
works with linux okay see and more have

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,950
you heard of that you did don't know

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:41,470
about it the raspberry pi was used in a

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:45,010
temperature and motor control system to

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:48,040
actually manage microbrew they basically

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,650
took an existing scale of a larger

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,040
implementation done from a relatively

00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:56,710
small brewery shrunk all of that down to

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,540
the needs of a small groups so you would

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,240
have maybe a couple or even just a

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,490
single instance doing the brew and they

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,560
have all of the hardware available as

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,750
open source hardware so you can go out

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,250
you can get the designs you can hand

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,680
make the boards you can have them boards

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,810
made for you is completely up to you and

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,670
they have every component listed so you

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,320
can do it all from scratch by yourself

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,850
and say I did that they have that and

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,579
they have also done the software so that

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,620
you can use on this I believe it may

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,960
have some notes and Python in there as

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,790
well so you have a web interface to be

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,680
able to track all of this and actively

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,250
monitor and react to when this stuff

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,530
happens that's a good example of

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,210
something using a pie with the developer

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,640
board to do something that they can

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,100
actually use as a commercial product but

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,670
has chosen to produce it completely open

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,590
for the community to use now in house

00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,180
today we do actually have the example

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:57,460
that we have from our booth which is a

00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:01,090
live scan of the FM frequencies that are

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,260
here in the building so for example all

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,550
the radio stations that are in the

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,780
immediate area we did find out that the

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:13,210
what was the channel that we're on for

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:17,920
the comms in here FRS channel 8 that was

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:19,090
what in the 496 megahertz yeah we did

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,290
find that and it's actually interesting

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,670
to kind of watch it because you know

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,730
what happens and when people were about

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,049
to get down with our talks

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,679
because all of a sudden that band jizz

00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:29,750
goes nuts now for that we're using a

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,940
BeagleBone black we're making use of the

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,790
LCD 7-inch cape this one happens to also

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,100
have a 7-inch resistive touchscreen

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,640
overlapped on top of that and we're

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:43,309
attaching that over USB to a rtls dr

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,850
stick it's a DP v tuner design for

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:49,360
Europe and Asia that can both do FM

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:53,480
tuning as well as DV bait and DV a

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,280
tuning for digital video the chip inside

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,960
it can be over in than the firmware

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,210
program so that you can use as a

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,980
software-defined radio which is what

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,440
we're doing in our particular case and

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,790
should you choose to play with it you

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,860
can actually scroll back and forth

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:10,610
through its available spectrum which is

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,850
27 megahertz through about 1.7 gigahertz

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,260
and we have it set up so we do have

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,400
gained and you can do some channel jumps

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,980
so if you want to go playing with things

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,210
and have a look at it please come by and

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,179
see it another example that we have is

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,980
should you say have a bunch of older

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:29,660
machines during a house or just a couple

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,270
of servers that you don't necessarily

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,880
want to keep a hard drive in you have

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,760
the ability to use pogoplug in this

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,160
particular case to actually do a pxe

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,940
boot to anything of course that would

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,010
want to talk to that so if Ben would

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,650
like to have a shot at this one it's

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:52,130
pretty straightforward in this case we

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:54,710
have a wet 10 year old laptop that has

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,910
the pixi capability and we have a

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,950
pogoplug running DNS mask with tftp and

00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,559
dhcp so that it can hand out that

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:10,010
configuration over to this laptop and

00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:12,830
low daddy bein live boot image as we

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:17,419
wait for the vga to come on there we go

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:19,610
and obviously you can see that it does

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,410
function and obviously we've cheated in

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,020
this case because we have laptop with a

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:27,679
pogoplug and we have three foot cable

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,360
but should you need to do this you don't

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,000
need to have a server running in your

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,179
basement that's eating six seven hundred

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,620
watts unless you need to have a server

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:39,170
with that much computer

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,210
horsepower you can use a plug or you can

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,590
use a raspberry pi or you can use a

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,820
BeagleBone black you can use many of

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,550
these devs boards these commercial

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,950
products and repurpose them or in the

00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,380
case of the open blocks use it as it was

00:20:48,950 --> 00:21:01,790
designed and be able to do items like

00:20:51,380 --> 00:21:03,920
this it's not a strict PC implementation

00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,590
it is using pxe but it's using paint

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,820
seen above the IKC program which has a

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:15,050
capability in avoiding in HTTP an image

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:18,620
over HTTP so this is actually apache web

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:26,090
server using IPC another program called

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:27,290
E&S mask that functions as the right and

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,660
for the sake of the video i'll repeat

00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:32,500
that quickly this he wanted to note that

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,320
this particular implementation is using

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,910
both pure pixie and also loading an eye

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,740
pixie program which capable of getting

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,590
more transports to be able to load the

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,740
images from so in his case he is DNS

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:48,890
mask serving DHCP and tftp to serve out

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,510
the initial pxe boot which is I pixie

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,850
and then I pixie turns around and

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:57,250
contacts his apache server to pull down

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,250
the live image of Debian

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,890
now like I said we also have a UAV

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,330
controller and I tried to get some of

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,160
the documentation from the guys doing

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,810
this unfortunately they said they're not

00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,850
ready to release the documentation but I

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,320
would have loved to have shown off so i

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,470
do apologize i don't have that

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,750
particular example now there are many

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,200
other things and items that we could

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,370
actually go ahead and cover however

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,140
getting that list together could be

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,670
ridiculously comprehensive and the one

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,710
thing I don't want to put any of you

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:48,380
through it is me going and reading off a

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:50,810
slide very monotone so we'll just go

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,780
ahead and go to the kiss theory here and

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:55,250
we'll go ahead wrap this base up and go

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,720
to any questions or comments that you

00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,190
guys may have in discussion we may want

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,560
to have any questions that I can answer

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,720
for you in a format like this be that in

00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,730
projects you might be interested in can

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,100
this piece of software or configuration

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,480
work in an arm instance and do I have

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:14,390
any suggestions for this type of

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:16,400
approach now as I said our TFT any

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,440
questions comments anything that you

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:25,190
could input to this feel free to ask me

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,650
anything at this time really nobody has

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:34,460
questions got one in the back do we have

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:36,920
Mike yes um I was just wondering with

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,530
that I pixie is there any way to have it

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,040
set up to where you can pick different

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:46,010
images that you might have absolutely in

00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,980
theory you could use I pixie to load for

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,140
example grub or anything like that and

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,720
now I'm not familiar as Ben is with I

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,580
pixie but yes I am aware that you can

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,870
actually set it up to bring it up and

00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,370
then you will have it you can provide it

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,000
with a list of configurations on which

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:04,850
one to go with so should you example

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,680
once use one of these with say a

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,420
computer lab in a high school and be

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,640
able to show people how these stacks

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:14,510
work and be able to introduce students

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,580
to multiple internet Linux installs and

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,340
how they work in the distro there in

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,540
then you could do this as an example and

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,540
it would work perfectly

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:36,200
nobody else Oh see now as I say it again

00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:43,490
and now there's six people yeah sure I

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:44,930
can cover some of the details could you

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,690
repeat it make sure they might got more

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:50,330
about the UNIX high-density servers sure

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,770
now I'll go ahead and cover project

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,700
moonshot because that actually has the

00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:58,130
most documentation at this point that

00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:02,059
originally was designed to work with a

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:03,950
chip call Cal Zeta I believe is the

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:08,290
company that made it and it was designed

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:13,809
to have dual quad core arm 7s with

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:15,770
believe a 15 s and four gigs of ram per

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,620
sock and then ever supposed to be two

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,380
socks each one having four gigs of RAM

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,920
attached on a slot and that slot would

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:28,059
be filled in similar to the old slot

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,050
load p3s about the same form factor

00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,910
probably a little bit larger but very

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:35,390
similar and then they had that hooked up

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,640
in a mesh across a backplane and they

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,980
have them stacked about a half inch

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,940
apart and then they have 16 of them back

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,470
and that's one module for which there

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,920
are multiple modules depending on the

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,750
size of the case that you had so in that

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,070
you had 32 socks with four cores each

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,250
you take that out and you attach i

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,040
believe it was four or even eight 10

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,320
gigabit backplane connections out to the

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,330
network and you can imagine the amount

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,390
of data that you can process on small

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:11,000
loads or say if you need to serve out a

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:14,480
whole lot of images you can fit a lot of

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,830
little images in 4 gigs and then you

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:24,260
take that and you have what 32 times 4

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:26,480
is 128 right so you've got 128 worker

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,940
instances working within 4 gigs of

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,590
memory apiece serving out small images

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:35,450
with 80 gigabits of backplane bandwidth

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,980
obviously this one little cluster is now

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:41,480
capable of out doing

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:42,919
probably half a rack of Intel Xeon just

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,860
because they manage to pack it all over

00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,280
the little phase now unfortunately there

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:52,309
were some issues with production

00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:55,580
requirement and of course the request of

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,020
the public for these kels ADA chips so

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,080
there were issues with that and right

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,730
now they are pursuing Intel Adams as an

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,559
example with a slight modification on

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,740
that because they can't put them two in

00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,900
a slot but now that the arm v8

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,880
architecture is available and chips are

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,250
starting to become available HP is

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,900
looking at that again and I can't go

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,220
into much detail because we're in talks

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,370
to the possibility of bringing arch

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,500
support to that but it is out there it

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,299
is coming as well and they will be in a

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,120
very similar fashion except this time

00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:29,000
they will have the full capacity of ddr3

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,980
there'll be 64 bit and the performance

00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,400
is about a hundred and fifty-seven

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,400
percent of a top-end course cortex a15

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,750
and you had questions I know I saw a

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:48,679
whole bunch of hands so just my mic

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:53,179
fellas going to have to find you what's

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:56,900
the most unusual unexpected of the Shelf

00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:59,240
consumer device that you've repurposed I

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:04,370
would have to say the she gauge

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:08,630
satellite it is a hard drive with a

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:11,150
small TI chip in it that is designed to

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,640
be set up with a Wi-Fi direct connection

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,530
for you to store your media for say a

00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,200
road trip you take the hard drive you

00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,000
charge it up and it's a Wi-Fi access

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,140
point that your kids connect their iPads

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,630
to and they can all watch their own

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,059
media off this hard drive well in the

00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,429
end it is running Linux and in the end

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:31,940
it is running an ARM chip that was an

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:33,650
interesting project so the hard drive is

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,290
basically a portable hard drive it's a

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,140
two-and-a-half-inch you know server

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,640
class hard drive and then they've put in

00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,290
dampeners to make it a little less of a

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,770
problem if the jostles are you know kid

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,570
drops it and then they smooshed in in

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,970
that layer on the opposite side of the

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:53,170
board just a little bit of the

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,670
server necessities and then the battery

00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,710
now obviously we took what it was meant

00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:04,160
to do and now we have a walking talking

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:05,690
HTTP server that does kismet that's

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,110
probably one of the most interesting

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,940
ones off the bat the one that we didn't

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,700
like doing the most because it was a

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:26,300
complete pain of the bud was turning an

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:28,250
Apple TV into the same kind of thing so

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,100
you mentioned our arch linux but what

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,810
about other projects like open wrt and

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,340
that how do they all play together

00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,610
what's the different what's going on

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:41,120
there in the end we all work together on

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:45,590
trying to bring board support their the

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,750
way the arm the eco system really works

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,690
is you have arm limited itself which is

00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:53,630
a chord risk machines they actually

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,520
produce the IP that is the logic of how

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,100
the cores are actually work they do the

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,000
actual design of that but they don't

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:05,090
implement that marvel global scale and

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,730
Vidya etc actually license the IEP and

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,740
implement that in silicon they then have

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,920
the right so they choose to optimize

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,820
that those people then are the

00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,650
implementers who are then being sold to

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,230
the integrators who produce the boards

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,300
now every single sock is essentially the

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,740
same until you attach it to a board in

00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,770
some different way because all of the

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,990
pins can be muxed so you have for

00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,210
example the Kirkwood there are so many

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,640
variants of this home Nass or this

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,930
little server or variations of it but

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,980
the pins are set up in all different

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:41,270
ways so for that as an example we all

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,710
work together to make sure the pins are

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,570
in the right place the drivers are

00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,850
performing as best as we can and that's

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:50,990
at the Linux level the lint GNU Linux

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:53,030
kernel but when it also comes down to

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,310
looking into performances and ways to

00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:58,550
improve those we communicate together

00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:01,910
there is no reason that open wrt and

00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:04,370
arch linux or debian or gin too

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:06,650
work together to try and solve and

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,320
optimize performance issues on a small

00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,780
device that may have say a small memory

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,660
bandwidth but has a very high disk

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,090
throughput at that point you would

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,620
obviously want to tweak Maria to be to

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,600
not be as memory intensive and be

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,820
willing to go to the disk more often if

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,710
you had something that has a USB

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,390
Attached hard drive but had good memory

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,490
throughput you'd obviously want to know

00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,040
that your community is aware to use more

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:33,350
memory and less disk things like that

00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:37,280
are the ways that we work together so

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:41,240
while I develop for arch my users rd

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:46,340
bein gentoo slackware open wrt and of

00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:48,350
course arch hay bales I know there were

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,860
more hands either I've already answered

00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:57,440
your question or it's not as interesting

00:31:51,860 --> 00:32:02,150
anymore anybody go now know the one oh

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,800
boy could could you walk through talk

00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,180
about the pixie with that laptop but for

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,680
some of these embedded devices what's

00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:12,320
how do you actually get the base

00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,900
firmware on them to actually start

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,480
developing with you know working with

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,960
them right so for example a commercial

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,050
product like the pogoplug the first

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,630
thing you do is find out how much of

00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:29,290
their sources have they put out with the

00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:33,320
GPL by requirement or by that own desire

00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,970
the second thing is to crack case that's

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,680
why I say I'm not afraid of a soldering

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,410
iron because should I accidentally knock

00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,700
a wire loose or the power adapter I know

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,860
that I can go back in there and I can

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,690
manage to fix it now most of these

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,310
devices is highly unlikely char actually

00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,820
going to break component off and trying

00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:52,340
to open the case but for example Ben was

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,230
actually having an issue wherein he

00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,880
wasn't getting the laptop he was trying

00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,090
to use for his presentation to properly

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,610
talk to this device but I happen to have

00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:04,400
my serial adapter for me with it and

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,590
while his setup had static IP addresses

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,180
and a switch unfortunately there was

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,410
some rounding configuration issues that

00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,760
were actually calling a problem so I

00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:15,320
popped open the case and there is a

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,270
series of four pin headers on

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,590
here and on the Kirkwood in particular

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:26,150
it's a 3.3 volt header you use a TTL USB

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:29,990
serial device for my fti if TDI or from

00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:32,770
for example just PL humor the name of

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:36,860
that company that makes that PL 2303

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,360
prolific that's it and you attach that

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,180
guy and it will basically give you a

00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,920
serial console many of these devices if

00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,780
you can find the pin headers whether

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,570
they've actually been exposed as a pen

00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,550
or simply a pad you can get on there and

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:54,200
you can attach a serial console and you

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:55,820
can see the boot so that's a number one

00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,010
first you get to watching it and then

00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,070
you look at what's available in the

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,500
bootloader you if necessary try and look

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,420
for jtag pins not that many devices have

00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,160
jtag pins exposed on the board because

00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,660
it's a production device at that point

00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,510
and they've gone through their debug

00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:15,440
cycles but a couple of them on occasion

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,970
do for example with the version 3 of

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,190
this guy that's the first thing I did

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,990
was hey does this thing happen to have a

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,350
serial header so I can watch it boot

00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:25,700
because all I saw as a pogoplug user was

00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:29,270
that it came online with the pogoplug

00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:31,400
service which in the end I now know that

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,310
means it booted up it managed to find

00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,490
the connection it got a dhcp address it

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:40,310
loaded the ipv6 tunnel module tunneled

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:43,160
out to their services and brought itself

00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,690
up hey my unique ID is this and then I

00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,530
was able to see it because I had linked

00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,330
to that unique ID to my account but what

00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,800
I did at that point was I went and I

00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,750
looked it was available in the boot

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,520
loader that came out of the device and

00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,750
what module was were loading what

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,450
version of the colonel and were they

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,480
using any proprietary drivers once I did

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,310
that I was able to say okay I need to

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,380
try and find the sources for the kernel

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,300
for this particular device and I need to

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,060
try and find the bootloader eventually

00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,120
if i can get this stock boot loader to

00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,470
load my kernel than i can work with that

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,420
that took some work but i did get the

00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,920
colonel pulled down i did manage to

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,650
modify it and rebuild it with a newer

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,960
glibc and then it was able to be run

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,970
full blown our clinic stat point which

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,860
also then brought support for debian and

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,210
slackware so

00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,040
the first thing you want to do when you

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,870
want to see how something works is go

00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,910
ahead and crack that case open see if

00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,560
you can find serial pins but remember

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:41,430
that only needs arm devices they're

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:45,570
likely to be either 3.3 volts 1.8 bolt

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:48,450
or just occasionally 5 volts most of

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:51,930
them are not 12 volt tolerant so please

00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:54,060
be careful hooking up a pc serial cable

00:35:51,930 --> 00:36:06,780
to a board you need to make sure it can

00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:09,330
take it so as a follow-up question what

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,440
kind of gear do you find you need in

00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:17,130
order to hack on these things my

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:21,510
favorite things are an ftdi adapter from

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:23,280
Jim that Sh he refers to as the FTX now

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,940
the reason for that is it's a little

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,890
tiny guy takes a micro USB and it has an

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,840
ftdi chip on it and it gives me all

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,390
kinds of expansions but in my case I

00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,700
only ever use the ground of transmit and

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,110
the receive because I only want to

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,150
listen to what the board is saying I

00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,370
don't want to give it voltage because I

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,320
don't know for a fact if they have the

00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,030
grounding done right I don't know if I'm

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,700
going to accidentally back feed power

00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:50,460
into the processor not things you want

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,110
to do other than that I also have a bus

00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,700
pirate there about 30 hours you can get

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:57,090
them from multiple sources either seed

00:36:53,700 --> 00:37:00,420
studio sparkfun things like that you can

00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:03,450
find the prolific chips there a nokia

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,130
see a 45 cables they're like three

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,840
dollars on ebay if you're willing to

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,720
wait the month that's going to take to

00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,120
get here from China I do want to warn

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,180
you about that though the chips that you

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,340
get from China with the pl 2303 seem to

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,670
have a problem with windows they will

00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,160
blue screen after about two hours so I

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,720
would if you're going to use that one I

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,470
would lean to not using it on windows

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,000
and get an ftdi chip now they make them

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,920
so they're already connected and nice

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,630
header they make them specifically for

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,700
the BeagleBone oil Raspberry Pi where

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,680
you've got a one foot cable with headers

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,440
that are specifically set up so that it

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,230
only has ground transmit and receive

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:48,060
Eve and then a standard USB plug other

00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:49,650
than that I use a bus pride for doing

00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,510
the scanning of anything at a signal

00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,310
rate to try and drive you know in the

00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,839
event that I don't have the right speed

00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,180
for the serial port maybe it's

00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,119
transmitting it something other than 115

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,950
200 I use a voltmeter to try and make

00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,750
sure that of course I give it the right

00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,829
voltage because 5 volt down a 3 volt

00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,530
line and vice versa not the best choice

00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:12,540
but that's really it you need a device

00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,240
that can talk to the comport like it's a

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,680
terminal and then you need a serial

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,359
device to be able to get you that

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,240
terminal and then you need to be able to

00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:23,700
know what and where the pins are so

00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,400
finding the pins is obviously your job

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,260
you're going to find four points or two

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,810
points in its round and so you can get

00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,609
that to work and then of course making

00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,260
sure the voltage is the voltmeter and

00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:36,300
then making sure the signaling rate if

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,400
you can't get it by watching it without

00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,780
CD but that's all you need to start and

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,200
technically you don't need half of that

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,480
start in this serial cable and then you

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,880
can be sure if you have the device

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:56,640
that's already supported then eighty

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,760
percent of the works done for you anyone

00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,760
else

00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:14,559
no okay well thanks for listening and I

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:16,509
hope you enjoyed your customers rely on

00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,759
your website or application if it's

00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:22,089
slower non-responsive it infuriates your

00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:23,920
users and costs you money keeping your

00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:27,410
business critical systems humming along

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,230
requires insight into what they're doing

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,240
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,490
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,650
resource limitations and other problems

00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,569
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,180
your systems performance metrics in

00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:44,030
real-time and record this data for later

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,010
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,020
see what's really going on under the

00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,150
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,160
visualize the status of all your systems

00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,890
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,010
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:00,470
memory swap processes load and network

00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:03,049
usage click a specific system to access

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:05,030
its individual dashboard then click and

00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:08,030
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,039
more detail comprehensive network data

00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,740
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,299
is available on the network tab and disk

00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,220
rights and free space on the disk

00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:19,069
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,589
displays usage statistics for individual

00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:23,780
processes the system info tab shows

00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:26,030
listening services active connections

00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,160
and available updates adding long view

00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,839
to a system is easy just click the

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,000
button copy the one line installation

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,430
command then run the command on your

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,140
linux system to complete the process the

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,299
agent will begin collecting data and

00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,170
sending it to longview then the graph

00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:42,720
start rolling

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:45,089
use longview to gain visibility into

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,829
your servers so when your website or app

00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:48,829
