the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,859
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,930
in 2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,449
possible good morning folks my name is

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,650
Dave Stokes I'm actually an oil Oracle

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,010
employee who's going to be talking

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,430
against big data for those you buy

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,489
lottery tickets might be your lucky day

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,870
as part of the rules for this talk if

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,210
you have a question please raise your

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,879
hand and the gentleman the back will

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,559
combine with a microphone if not i'll

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,739
try to repeat your question so what is

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,829
big data for those of you without gray

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,230
hair the computer industry moves in

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,899
cycles those who use gray here i can see

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,489
your grimacing already you'll hear

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,159
something it's a new buzzword and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,860
someone will come out and point out well

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,920
gee virtual instances of machines

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,420
running on hardware I mean IBM had that

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,009
one in the 70s without the Iowa 360g

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,229
putting your data out on another service

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:28,500
wasn't that compuserve so several years

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,270
ago big data popped up and of course

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,450
you've all probably been told that if

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,159
you don't have a big data project you're

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,780
you're an underachieving slimy piece of

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,009
trash and you really should be ashamed

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,909
yourself and she got and get big data

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,280
I've been hitting a lot of big data

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,040
conferences and each one of them I walk

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,149
out of them going what are they really

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,759
trying to accomplish so when Jeremy was

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,829
talking about submissions for this I

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,450
fear well I probably should have a talk

00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,189
that's not about my usual subject which

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,580
is MySQL I should probably talk about

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,920
big data and I asked

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,530
well what is big data so I did what

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,090
every good person in the u.s. does we'll

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,620
have a question I went up to google and

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:17,340
i typed in big data and I got 838

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,420
million hits by the way Google now just

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,280
gives you an estimate it doesn't give

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,910
you the exact hits anymore in the old

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,110
days used to do that so very well what's

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:33,360
that relative to how big is big so I

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,520
typed in world peace well there's more

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,080
people working on world big data than

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,900
world peace so that's kind of

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:45,360
understandable hopefully so I figure

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,590
well how about the cure for cancer not

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,970
even close so I popped open a beer and I

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,440
sat down well what are the other big

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,930
things that are plaguing our society

00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:01,830
that everyone knows about and everyone's

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:05,300
doing something about evidently big data

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,300
is bigger than everything else

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,170
absolutely stunning that even the

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,590
Kardashians don't have a candle to big

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:19,020
data so my next question being someone

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:25,230
who is educated at a liberal arts

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:27,750
Catholic College is big data good well

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,730
on May nineteenth this year in the Wall

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,910
Street Journal I found an article on

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,480
banking and big data and in the third

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,670
paragraph I saw something that made me

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,130
pop open my mouth and go what are they

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,019
thinking about and as you can see the

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,760
key element and success for any project

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,709
involving big data is accepting

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,410
embracing decision making with less than

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,489
ideal information how many of you would

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,350
feel comfortable telling your boss

00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:00,470
here's my recommendation that it's made

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,470
with less than ideal information

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,709
so figuring with banks and less than

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:14,810
ideal information what could go wrong

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:18,500
there so I dug into the literature on

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,910
big data I was lucky that I was at an

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,050
o'reilly conference and I was able to

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,750
snag their big book on big data and I

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,729
was looking for success stories well

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,800
they had won by the way all these slides

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,690
are in slideshare.net / Dave Stokes so

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,669
don't worry about trying to memorize

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,860
this or copy down or take photographs of

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,630
it you can read it all later and I have

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,889
annotated the things that I put out

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,690
there so this was a story about Walmart

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,639
Walmart is a very successful company

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,410
good or bad you have to admire that

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,180
they've basically gone from a little

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,630
five-and-dime store in the middle of

00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,690
nowhere Arkansas to a worldwide

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,509
conglomerate they were looking at their

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:04,880
data and they figured out that before a

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:07,750
big hurricane hit Florida that they need

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:16,310
to stock up on two things beer and

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:17,300
strawberry pop-tarts I I could I figured

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,849
out the beer and the strawberry

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,590
pop-tarts you figure well strawberry

00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,940
park tops pop tarts are good forever

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,080
they come in that foil you can throw

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,330
them the back of the closet the

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,210
hurricane doesn't wipe you out you still

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,090
got food and then I started really

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,340
thinking about it and occasionally you

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:39,860
see narked like this where the authors

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,750
are surprised at the the basically the

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,659
rednecks in Florida and their demands me

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,620
for a hurricane and I got thinking that

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:50,030
their problem wasn't that is that Rome

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,180
art didn't realize that they're rednecks

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,400
were different than the Florida rednecks

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,020
now in Arkansas you have tornadoes which

00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,669
are like hurricanes but they're much

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,440
shorter duration and usually not as

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:06,320
extensive and if you check in Arkansas

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,389
before big floods they still have the

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,560
amazing propensity that they want beer

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,560
and pop tarts

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,770
so here's a cute little cartoon yes sir

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:29,850
okay parable of beer and diapers Walmart

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,820
back in the early 90s had a kroger card

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,020
type of thing where they scan the

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,390
customer scan the card and then they

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,930
were able to process according to the

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:43,260
story they found a correlation between

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,270
young men like in their 20s and to

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,720
common items that they had in their

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,540
shopping cart on Friday afternoons beer

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,680
and diapers these weren't adult diapers

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,950
are actually diapers for children right

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,510
I don't feel you guys this yeah would

00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,940
say so if you go into a walmart

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,980
supercenter now look to see where the

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,690
diapers and the beer art if you'll

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,830
notice there in the back of the store

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,960
close together cool but that's a story

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,140
that's a better story than the one you

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,050
had I laughed incorporate that target

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,240
actually has a program where if you sign

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,890
up well whether thing announcing that

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,740
you're having a baby and you're gonna

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,940
have a baby shower that eight to ten ten

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,400
months later they start sending you

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,140
coupons for diapers and then they start

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,170
sending you coupons for formula and then

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,940
the 2t 3t stuff it hasn't been around

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,530
long enough so that when the kids at 16

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,530
they automatically start shipping Maalox

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,170
but a lot of the studies would you read

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,000
about open well big data if you read

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,290
them carefully with a jaundiced eye you

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,780
tend to spot other problems with them so

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,460
my next step after figuring out the

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,920
success stories were kind of amazing to

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,280
me is a lot to Wikipedia like all good

00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,520
data scientists do and start figuring

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,560
what is Wikipedia consider big data well

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,590
basically answer is big data is much

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,040
bigger than you have now so go out my

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,040
disk drives

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:19,669
so if you're going to go out and play

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:22,850
with big data what do you need well if

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:26,419
you go out to cloudera and start talking

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,740
about running a Hadoop cluster the first

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,400
thing you know they have two types of

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,860
nodes one is for holding data and the

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,169
others for organizing coalescing and

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,400
processing and all that and then when

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,839
you start looking at the recommendations

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,669
for that you realize that these are the

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,830
most expensive boxes that you can find

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,450
so if you go through and you look for

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,339
the things with the bonded ethernet sand

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,290
the hype quad-core processors are better

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:55,910
and all the member you can get you start

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:57,080
adding things up any figure well I'm

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,270
going to need at least a couple least

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,910
what is the average person doing with a

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,529
Hadoop cluster well according this study

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,690
the average to do cluster starts off

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:10,220
with around 200 boxes has anyone ever

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,000
hear sign a purchase order for over two

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,589
million dollars before when the stuff

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
finally showed up was a mountainous it

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,080
was just that you get a lot of stuff for

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,110
two million dollars a lot of packing

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,450
materials part of the y2k thing I bought

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,540
over 10 million dollars of computers for

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,110
a government contractor I didn't know

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,630
they'd all show up on the same day

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,100
I didn't know the trucker would drop

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,529
them off in front the building at six

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,149
thirty in the morning and I also didn't

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,880
realize it would take up all the parking

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,440
lot there is no place to park a great

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,190
way to win win friends and influence

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,600
enemies yeah I got a lot of stuff and

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,180
right before a rainstorm and had to

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,790
literally put computers and toilet

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,779
stalls just to keep them off the the

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:01,209
parking lot so if you go out by your 200

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,269
boxes you're going to have over two

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,140
hundred thousand dollars in servers

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,110
notice before you go out and buy the

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,540
racks and the cables and the cable ties

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,800
and the little screws and the

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,390
screwdriver kiss you never find the

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,769
screwdriver put things in the rack and

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,570
then you're going to need someone who

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,250
actually will babysit this and oh by the

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,440
way the cleaning staff needs an extra

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,570
body because you have this this thing in

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,079
there so if you're doing an average

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,600
crack of do plus ters like it's awfully

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,089
expensive oh by the way you probably

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,950
will just get a discount from Dell or

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:38,110
IBM or anyone else if you do buy 200

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:39,970
quantity of anything from them so after

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,800
you have your stuff what are you

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,079
supposed to do with it and then I ran

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,550
across this quote from the founder of

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,529
Amazon he never throws away anything we

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,890
have shows on A&E about people like that

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:56,890
but if you're a multi-billionaire as

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,170
seen as brilliant so I started talking

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,440
to some of my colleagues who are doing

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,029
Big Data projects and I said is this a

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,990
valid assumption that you're never ever

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:11,050
ever going to throw away everything and

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,550
they say well within reason the recent

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,430
IRS scandal if you've been following

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,230
that evidently someone running exchange

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,360
server never did back up and had only

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:24,610
one set of tapes they recycled and the

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,230
throw away disk drives I can see this we

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,360
never throw away anything being part of

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,149
the government more from now on but the

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,810
only trouble with that well before I go

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,310
someplace else this little quote for

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,810
some organizations facing hundreds of

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,370
gigabytes of data for the first time may

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,699
trigger a need to reconsider data

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:46,920
management options the options you want

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,920
or for stock and disk drive companies

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,650
if you have tens of hundreds of

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,420
terabytes before data size becomes a

00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,100
significant consideration that's kind of

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,100
a viagra commercial where they warn you

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,540
about the four hour time period that is

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,330
a lot of disk drives if you've never

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,770
managed a disk drive farm they'll tell

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,650
you the mean time between failure will

00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,540
be several hundred thousand hours well

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,560
those are the average drives and the one

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,200
they shipped you or the below-average

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,270
drives and you'll start having a pop out

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,630
at 100 hours a thousand hours 500 hours

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:25,350
it's really messy to have a several

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,850
terabytes of data so you're saving

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:32,250
everything and you end up with a digital

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,420
landfill now in some companies you're

00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,330
small enough where you're able to keep

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,880
every email so you have the stuff from

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,680
the softball league from 10 years ago

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,790
you have the things about who stole my

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,740
lunch how that the cafeteria but in a

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,360
lot of the world you can't keep all the

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,000
data if you're doing credit card

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,090
compliance PCI rules say you can't keep

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,910
all the information out there if you're

00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,740
running HIPAA if you're doing anything

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,390
in the medical world there are some

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,660
records you have to retain and others

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,130
you can't sarbanes-oxley you're supposed

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,400
to keep some records for at least 10

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:11,430
years and possibly as many as 50 so

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,630
those are stuff you got to keep but what

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,330
about the other stuff out there do you

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,740
really want to keep everything and the

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,200
big trouble is if you're going to manage

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,850
this for the rest of your life how are

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,140
you going to do it you're going to have

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,210
to have disk drives spinning all the

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,130
time because you write out to cd-rom

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,830
you're guaranteed one year of life on

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:32,190
average if you print it out you're going

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,900
to have a vault full of documentation if

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,160
you write it out to a tape you'll be

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,200
lucky if you can reread it in three

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,660
years so suddenly we're not throwing

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,100
everything away we're being told to keep

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,250
it and then the laws are telling us

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,250
different

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,800
for those of you under 40 you've

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,360
probably never seen these ads 10 megabit

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,770
hard drives used to be a bargain

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,600
thirty-five hundred dollars and the ad

00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,279
on the left was one of the first IBM

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,589
computers you could actually get into an

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,560
office before that they're kind of the

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:08,200
size of motor home so what are the

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,570
vendors telling us about big data well

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,120
the first message I include my company

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,470
is buy you need to buy because you need

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,220
big data being data is going to solve

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,620
all your problems well at hadoop world

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,940
last year IBM had a big presentation

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,610
they had their vp of big data and he

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,930
said I'm glad you're all here I hope

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,910
you've gone through the expo hall

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,589
there's 200 vendors there and this time

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,500
several much from now how those

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,760
companies will be out of business what

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,560
sounds right because of the startup

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,440
businesses tend to feel rather quickly

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,460
they said another year from now half of

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,510
the half that's left are going to be out

00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:51,580
of business sounds right that's the way

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,010
things tend to shake out and then this

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,780
next argument floored me so therefore

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,350
you should all by IBM because we've been

00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,350
around forever

00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,769
if you can't see the the caption in the

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,749
back it's a scientist with a rat before

00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:14,459
maze and it says are you sure you're

00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:15,720
just not teaching to the test so the

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,160
more I dug into big data the more I

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,079
found out it was the emperor's new

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,610
wardrobe there was a lot of stuff that

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,040
people were claiming to be there that I

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,629
really didn't see and the more I asked

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,199
the more I realized other people weren't

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:31,019
seeing it and it's what I call a science

00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,519
fair project people were told they

00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,319
needed to have big data so therefore

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,420
damn it we went out and had a science

00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:39,839
fair project and we do something with a

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,720
big data the first one that hit me was

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,999
that Avis spent billions of dollars to

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,179
figure out what customers really needed

00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:50,279
during an economic downturn and if you

00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,540
read between the lines basically they

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,069
were paying more attention to getting

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,639
their customers to come back and repeat

00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:59,429
rent from them I don't see why they need

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,259
to be data for that people have been

00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,980
doing that for thousands of years when

00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:09,299
neck economics go back go bad then the

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,679
big flashy one lady gaga decided that

00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,439
she wanted to have our own mailing list

00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,559
so she went out and had her people use

00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,179
big data to contact everyone that had

00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,889
her Twitter feed and was her friend on

00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,980
facebook to sign up for her mailing list

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:29,629
I'm so glad I used to do clusters to do

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:32,339
that next 1 800 flowers data mined and

00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:35,160
used to do and they studied all the

00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:38,249
records and they realized that people

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,549
tend to buy flowers on reappearing

00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:43,290
repeating time periods called years for

00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:46,739
things like birthdays and anniversaries

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,689
and holidays so by data mining they're

00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,189
able to figure out that if your

00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:52,439
birthday's on the same date every year

00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:56,730
maybe they you want to get a flowers

00:16:52,439 --> 00:17:00,509
that year the one that on the bottom of

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,970
their us cycling team if there's any

00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,399
cycle racing fans in there you have my

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,029
misery my commemoration I used to race

00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:10,860
bicycles half a lifetime 100 pounds ago

00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:12,089
before the last Olympics the team was

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,220
worried because there are five seconds

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,169
slower than everybody else

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,520
so they spent millions of dollars

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:20,370
looking at everyone's biometric

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,770
information having doctors looking at it

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,110
processing everything and dammit they

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,530
went to the the Olympics and they were

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,760
four seconds faster unfortunately that

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,630
got them a silver medal instead of a

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,340
gold now the trick with that is could

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,419
those athletes rather than having all

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,340
the probes stuck them in their various

00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,659
orifices and being watched by doctors if

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:45,450
they train harder because it picked up

00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:50,789
that other second anyone know what this

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:53,700
is a picture of there's a gentleman

00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:56,850
named George Westinghouse who was

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,650
studying the problems of railroads when

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,150
the big problems used to be that if you

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,130
had a train coming into a town you had

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,140
to slow down well how did you do that

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,630
well you put people called brakeman on

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,030
top of box cars and they walked up to

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,220
big metal wheels and slowly started

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,960
cranking the brakes on but you can only

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,669
do it so much per car before he had to

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,370
go to the next car and you had to go to

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,870
100 cars you had a hundred breaks that

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,340
had to be adjusted and reset and as you

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,409
slow down further you had to tighten

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,200
down on the brakes meanwhile the engines

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:28,860
slowing down big involved process lots

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,419
of labor very dangerous very costly the

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,360
train had to start slowing down miles

00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,370
before the town even appeared in the

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,770
distance just to make sure you didn't

00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,000
overshoot where you wanted to go so

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,929
Westinghouse use something called

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,130
compressed air to apply brakes

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:47,039
Westinghouse is also a guy who backed

00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,890
Nikola Tesla for his electronic

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,530
experiments many years later it became a

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,419
very rich man and he started investing

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,990
money and studying how people did things

00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,580
and

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,810
it's called the Hawthorne effect or the

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,890
Westinghouse effect what happened is he

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,800
was trying to make everything better

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,170
first workers so he figured well maybe

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,650
if I give them brighter surroundings in

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,240
the workshop they'll be more productive

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,430
so they increase the lighting in the

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:22,140
workshop and productivity went through

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:23,850
the roof hey that's great well could we

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,350
do something else to fiddle with their

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,360
environment to make everything better so

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,900
they made more adjustments productivity

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,860
went through the roof and eventually

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,780
they get to the point really realized

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,430
gee we do anything and they're so

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,780
paranoid about what we're doing they

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,510
start working harder because they know

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,740
we're up to something so they switched

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,710
everything back to the original

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,100
configuration you know bad lighting look

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:49,680
no air and all that and guess what

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,420
productivity shot through the roof shows

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,800
that the paranoia of a worker is more

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:57,360
powerful than just about anything else

00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,470
in American business therefore I think

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,620
we should have this posted on the

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,620
outside of every business in the country

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:12,640
so back to Big Data do we really need

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:15,280
big data is there something new out

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,620
there that needs us to quantify big data

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,810
is there something so astounding and

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,160
fresh and new that we really have to

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:27,880
track it with all these extraordinary

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:30,250
methods well yes and no if you're a DBA

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,550
until fairly recently if you were doing

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,070
a record that contained genders of a

00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:40,090
subject you would probably do the binary

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,340
option male or female I have to DBS up

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,990
here and they're kind of yelling at me

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,990
well if you had a really advanced DBA

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,800
that give you a third option they put in

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,420
a null in the database world null means

00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,340
you don't have any data you don't have

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,930
anything recorded for that and it's a

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,480
separate status and it's a pain in the

00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:02,410
ass for processing data but it does

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,790
represent what's supposed to do well how

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,950
many for your businesses this is good

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,330
enough go see a raise of hands how many

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,150
for your businesses can get by with me

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:14,200
up male female and unknown well guess

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:18,840
what state of California has 17 official

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:23,680
gender statuses facebook has 58 and

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,530
growing the funny thing about the one is

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,360
in California someone I know who works

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,370
for a municipality out there had to

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,730
change all his data from the binary male

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,890
female to the 17 and then he had to

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,200
report how that broke down by male

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,200
female to the state of California

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:49,260
so if you see dbas having problems and

00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,750
looking like this it's not always the

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,220
database it's sometimes the knees being

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:59,280
forced on them now this is a picture of

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,550
what a Frenchman in 1900 thought life in

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,410
Paris were looked like in the year 2000

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:08,700
and as you can see he got it exactly

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:11,220
right the level with head scarfs and

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,740
buffle bustles and the men in leather

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,740
cats is extraordinary realistic

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,899
so in the past what do they think about

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,000
big data well there's a gentleman who

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:28,480
decided that giving the way things were

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,260
growing that the Yale library alone

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,690
would need 200 million volumes of just

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:39,250
to hold all the data in the world well I

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:41,580
checked there are only 185 million short

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,580
right now

00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:50,340
so this big data newish well on 61 a

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,110
gentleman predicted that as our

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,700
population continues to grow we'll have

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,860
more and more in scientific advances and

00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,360
with that scientific advancement we'll

00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:02,730
have more and more data well the birth

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,710
rate has declined but we still gathering

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,930
more and more data despite the birth

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:13,530
rate sinking so it's not tied to prefer

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:16,830
to Arthur Miller wrote this nice little

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,480
quote too many information handlers seem

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:24,240
to measure a man by the number of bits

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,980
of storage this dossier will occupy for

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,070
those who don't know Arthur Miller he

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,800
was the prototypical alpha geek of his

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,640
time period and he was also married to

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:40,320
Marilyn Monroe so he's an expert on at

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:44,070
least one thing so we realized that big

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,940
data isn't all that new someone not that

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:50,430
far ago in my lifetime said there may be

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,580
a few thousand petabytes of data all

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:56,899
told

00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:00,769
a few thousand well Facebook has close

00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:04,090
to a few thousand petabytes so the

00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:04,090
scaling is is kind of off

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,630
and then about two three years ago we

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,400
started seeing people coming up saying

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,580
gee we're getting all this stuff but

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,960
does it really do us any good you know

00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:21,940
what happens to the data out there on

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:25,720
you is bad could explain why I'm getting

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:31,240
so many emails in my inbox for breast

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:33,130
reduction surgery and my wife does not

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:38,730
appreciate the things on prostate

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,730
reduction medications it's kind of nasty

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,930
so maybe we're not really looking at a

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:48,220
big data problem maybe our problem is

00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,570
we're too hyper active maybe we're not

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,220
looking at what we really want to study

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,920
what do we really want to do what do we

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,900
really want to know and as I go around

00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,400
the world and I talked to big business

00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,860
leaders and folks doing Big Data

00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,480
projects and I ask them the questions

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,640
what do you really want to know when do

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,210
you really want to know it how do you

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,290
quantify what you what you want often

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,240
they say well we don't know we don't

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,580
know and we're trying to trip over it

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,940
and find it out and others are saying

00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,200
well we're doing big data because all

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,410
the ads say we should be doing a big

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,410
data

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:24,799
so you gather all that data and you hand

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:30,139
it off to someone like this who thinks 4

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,429
out of 10 is a majority I bet you half

00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:35,659
the people in Congress couldn't pass

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:39,799
that and tell you what's going on wrong

00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:42,110
there one of my favorite correlations is

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,110
people who like single-sex public

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:51,710
schools are more likely to do so if they

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:53,509
enjoy hot pockets you know correlation

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,830
and causality or not always directly

00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:57,409
linked but there's something in hot

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:03,139
pockets that make people want to not be

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:04,940
around members of the other sex this is

00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:06,619
a correlation between fresh lemons

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,039
imported the u.s. from Mexico and the

00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:09,039
death rate

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:20,149
yeah I mean it's it's staggering how

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,799
well that we're doing now that we don't

00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:25,159
I guess it must be a scurvy problem that

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,510
we're having trouble unfortunately

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,470
people are looking information like this

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:32,630
and making decisions there's one that I

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,399
can't mention that they decided they did

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,950
some data mining and decided they were

00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,179
going to do a big investment in painting

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,909
some of their cars blue because they

00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:42,440
sent up that their cars that were blue

00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,389
colored only sold on Tuesday and

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,100
therefore they're going to ramp up and

00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:48,889
make special deals on their imported

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,240
cars are going to be painted blue well

00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:51,649
they finally did a second study and

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,120
realize the only reason the blue cars

00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:56,649
are selling more on Tuesdays all the

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,649
other colors were selling out on Monday

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:05,269
here's another one rate of ice cream

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,309
sold versus the rate of murders so i

00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:11,179
guess if we somehow got that in there

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:14,419
with the limes we were in trouble best

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:16,070
one yet the suckiness of M night

00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:20,000
Shyamalan movies to the decline and

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,289
newspaper readership so his movies would

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,360
be much better if we all had a

00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:32,210
subscription to a newspaper this is

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:35,019
better the murders in the US vs Internet

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,019
Explorer releases

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,860
or tech support

00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,139
so

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,429
how many of you are actually thinking of

00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,870
having a big data project at work

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,190
because your boss wants you to have one

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,169
or you think that you need to get into

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,980
it or something looks interesting to you

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:55,990
any okay how many of you got into the

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,519
Big Data business played around that and

00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,289
found absolutely nothing useful for your

00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,139
business or something only kind of

00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:03,490
temporary and how many you're just

00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,750
saying gee they keep talking about Big

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,360
Data maybe I should learn something

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,809
about it maybe I should run Hadoop and

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,269
yeah so if you really wanted to do a big

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:16,330
data project and you're working in a

00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:17,470
fortune 400 company god bless you you

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,940
have to go up by a hundred thousand

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:23,649
boxes hopefully you'll be retirement age

00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,899
by the time things really come up for

00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:27,820
review and by the way getting a hundred

00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:30,129
thousand boxes running in any

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,480
architecture and getting them stable

00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:34,600
before you start implementing takes a

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,909
lot of effort and a lot of crew third

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,269
recommendation stock and disk drive

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,269
companies

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:48,320
the other reason if you're going to do

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:50,480
big data sometimes you just need it the

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,570
check mark for your boss on his yearly

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,840
review oh yeah we went women in big data

00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,800
if you do that that's good now for a

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,970
very small number of us you have the

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,130
money you have the budget you have the

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,720
staff or the return on investment we're

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,700
going through this huge investment in

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,250
minutely looking at your data is going

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,350
to pay off in the engineering fields

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,060
they've been using finite element

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:17,500
analysis for decades to refine the

00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:20,840
quality of parts that's why a Chevy

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:24,020
sedan now weighs about 1,200 pounds

00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,870
lighter than a stew there are big bang

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,370
Bang's games to me being there but

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,840
they're not easy they're expensive and

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,840
they take a lot of work

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,260
so

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:41,110
I feel like I'm throwing up this this

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,790
signpost in front of you but I just

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,710
wanted to have a quick talk on big data

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,630
and some of the trends and some of the

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,190
things I'm seeing and i also want to use

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,650
this to gather information from you all

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,080
what are you guys hearing on big data

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,080
what are you guys realistically thinking

00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,760
about is anyone else like me saying the

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:06,640
emperor has no clothes so when I'm okay

00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:09,070
with it at the same time hey I'm Nick am

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,870
a PhD student at Clemson and so my

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,490
research involves moving large

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,710
quantities of data so I like people that

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,600
have a lot of big data because they're

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,640
my customers I don't necessarily care

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:23,830
what they do with it I will move from A

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,090
to B the funny thing is you'll be

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,980
collecting resumes from the rest of us

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:31,450
at the end of the talk what about in

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,090
scientific research I mean isn't that

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,530
kind of where who dude started from and

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,860
in things like you know search for

00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:41,200
planets and other solar system

00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:43,510
scientific research in some aspects

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,570
especially the medical field where they

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,570
do

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,160
genetic sequencing stuff not so much

00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,809
that it's just that they have a process

00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,910
they've had for a couple hundred years

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,460
where you make a study you publish your

00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,800
results someone else looks at comes back

00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,750
and repeats them or doesn't repeat them

00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,820
and they publish their results so over a

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,880
period of time you get a body of science

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,309
it comes out and says yeah if you if we

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,860
poke an infant with a sharp object in

00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:13,190
the right buttock they will cry stimulus

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,750
response great move on maybe next time

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,090
we'll job with something not as sharp or

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,670
something colder they have a methodology

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:23,059
a lot of the trouble with the global

00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:24,500
warming methodology you see is someone

00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:25,910
role in a data model and they won't give

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,280
up the model and will give up your data

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,590
is it right or wrong well there's no way

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,400
to test it a lot of the social

00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:36,920
engineering data that you see is just

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,870
pure garbage when you analyze it it's

00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,300
kind of saying well tall people tend to

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,309
play basketball short people tend to

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,490
ride horses so therefore a tall person

00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:49,330
can't ride a horse that's a lot of the

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,330
problems I see there

00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,700
um I would say one of the observations i

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,440
make about your point is and things i've

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,070
seen with a work I've done and watch

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,590
other people do is I guess the concept

00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,120
of big data say maybe 10 15 20 years ago

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,440
remember didn't use those words but what

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,360
you were trying to do with just data

00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,130
analytics and general collective thing

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,110
there have been some really significant

00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,330
accomplishments but I think we're kind

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,340
of that next generation where you know

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,830
what the new version of big mean I think

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,930
you've correctly pointed out that there

00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:28,290
is like a threshold of absurdity where

00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:31,140
you've you've gained all the low-hanging

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,270
fruit or meaningful information that you

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,000
can get and then now you're just just

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,440
simply by storing orders of magnitude

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,600
more data the same things you don't

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,360
necessarily gain any new analytical

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,530
insight just automatically the senate's

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:49,170
motivation I worked for a column or

00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:51,630
database company for a while and the

00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:55,080
sweet spot on the data there was 26

00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,000
billion rows very few of us work for

00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,800
companies where they have records of 26

00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,380
billion anything

00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,420
but in one case we had an airline that

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,630
was looking through their records trying

00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,920
to figure out baggage loss issues when

00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,440
were there more likely to happen what

00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,380
airports what employees and they're able

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,810
to find out by time periods in

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,580
correlation over years it you know Ralph

00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,970
at DFW Airport was a guy who was

00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,020
stealing the camera bags off the belt

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,340
could they have solved that faster and

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:28,020
easier by having a camera or a

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:30,390
supervisor watching Ralph yeah the big

00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,560
trouble is this company spent lots of

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,890
money with the business I was employed

00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:38,330
by which I appreciate it but I think the

00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,330
return on investment wasn't worth it

00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,310
brothels in here today is he

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,019
any other questions or comments or

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,640
so to be honest her on my side on the

00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,800
vendor side I'm appreciating the

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,730
interest in big data because it's part

00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,020
of what drives our business that said

00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,899
you had a use case when you talked about

00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:16,500
gender and the use case talks about dbas

00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:18,270
one of the arguments against keeping

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,850
everything in a relational database is

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:23,250
because you need that overhead with a

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,870
standard unstructured data base like you

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,480
know Cassandra Hadoop or something like

00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:29,520
that your scenario doesn't require db8

00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,110
developer just adds the additional

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,419
elements to the gender list and that's

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,370
it so there's a lot less overhead

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,679
involved and that's what seems to be

00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,330
attractive to a lot of at least from an

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,149
enterprise perspective up this is why

00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:44,129
this database is better now they know a

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,480
lot of our things but that's one of the

00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,940
I arias that I'm hearing is that

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,919
self-managed inning I don't need to hire

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,090
this very expensive DBA to manage yeah I

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,470
don't need a sapote of very expensive

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:57,570
DBA but I have to hire Pete two PhDs in

00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:02,130
statistical research which are a lot

00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:03,510
more into that yeah well originally when

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,650
COBOL came around there all the

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,200
programmers are going to go away because

00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,240
it was a common object or a common

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,700
business oriented language so therefore

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,700
any businessman can write down and type

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:18,450
and select from this data go to this

00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:21,330
data giving that I think you might see

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,620
the dv8 I'll change slightly instead of

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,750
just being relational data it's going to

00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,920
be all data also see you're going to see

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,280
a whole bunch of branches of data

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,980
scientists

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,930
maybe epidemiologists leaping into there

00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,850
so she were gonna save money but not

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,520
having the pain in the ass dba's anymore

00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:41,230
but suddenly you have a whole new crop

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,230
of pains in the butt

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,700
well thank you all for coming out if you

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,130
have any questions I'm over in the

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,220
Oracle booth around the corner and thank

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,220
you

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,820
your customers rely on your website or

00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,190
application if it's slower

00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,130
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,960
and costs you money keeping your

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:43,480
business critical systems humming along

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,760
requires insight into what they're doing

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,740
your system metrics tells stories

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,720
stories that can reveal performance

00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,060
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,619
other problems but how do you keep an

00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,290
eye on all of your systems performance

00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:59,290
metrics in real-time and record this

00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:01,060
data for later analysis enter longview

00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,100
the new way to see what's really going

00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,260
on under the hood the long view

00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,300
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,760
of all your systems providing you with a

00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:13,150
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,730
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,470
load and network usage click a specific

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,869
system to access its individual

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,410
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:24,790
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:26,470
comprehensive network data including

00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,780
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,340
available on the network tab and disk

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,260
rights and free space on the disk

00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,109
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,630
displays usage statistics for individual

00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:39,820
processes the system info tab shows

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,070
listening services active connections

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,200
and available updates adding long view

00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,880
to a system is easy just click the

00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,040
button copy the one line installation

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,470
command then run the command on your

00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,180
linux system to complete the process the

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,369
agent will begin collecting data and

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,170
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:58,780
start rolling
