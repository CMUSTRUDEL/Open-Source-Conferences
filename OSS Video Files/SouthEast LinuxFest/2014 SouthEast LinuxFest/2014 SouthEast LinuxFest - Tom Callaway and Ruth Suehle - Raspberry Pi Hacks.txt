the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,250

or the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,939
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:35,520
in 2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:37,230
possible hi so Ruth and I worked for red

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,030
hat we're in the open sourcing standards

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,649
group which is part of the cta's office

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:47,219
and we wrote a book called raspberry pi

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,989
hacks we like raspberry pi we had a lot

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,670
of fun with it we were some of the first

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,989
people to actually have the first

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,149
revision of the raspberry pi hardware

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,550
and one of the things that we commonly

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,020
kept coming across was the fact that

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,170
lots of people eventually had a

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,570
raspberry pi but had no idea what to do

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,159
with it aside from either trying to get

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,850
a whole bunch of them and make a cluster

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,260
or turn it into a media center and so we

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,180
decided that we would come up with a

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,290
whole bunch of ideas on what you could

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,049
do with the Raspberry Pi that were

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:23,720
neither of those things and have done

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,710
something with it yeah that's about

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,540
although it's been steadily increasing

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,180
so we've been talking about the piper

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,479
two ish years now and in the beginning

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,770
it was all like about day one that in my

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,409
drawer ever since and the number is

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,170
steadily increasing and i think at

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,759
penguicon when we gave this talk almost

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,190
everybody had built something really

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,570
awesome

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,040
and I kind of just want to let the rest

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,980
of the room give the talk it's getting

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,750
weird but yeah so I used to make that

00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,310
joke that everybody's was XBMC and then

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,110
we thought of an Upton who created it

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,280
give a keynote at Linux cotton he said

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,600
the same thing that they're about two

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,640
million raspberry PI's out there now

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,410
about a million of the maroon somebody's

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,850
drawer and another half familiar XBMC

00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,110
and then the last half somebody's

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,870
actually built something they actually

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,100
just hit 23 million mark really yes so

00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,660
yeah we'll get that let's talk about the

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,899
history of the pot before we say all

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,900
that so Evan was a chip architect at

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,730
broadcom and and then was working at

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,430
Cambridge University and he realized

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,140
that the students coming in were let's

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,080
say not the quality that the students of

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,210
the past had been and so kids who grew

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,040
up in the 80s and even into the 90s

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,750
we're building their own computers and

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,700
then had to program them to make them do

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,950
anything at all but then the kids who

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,840
get to college now or like I can open

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,640
Firefox would go to a website I'm

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,140
practically a programmer and so they

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,520
were spending a lot of time in the

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,410
beginning of their computer science

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,510
education teaching the very basic stuff

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,010
that kids used to come in with and so

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,080
that was the entire inspiration for the

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,970
Raspberry Pi was to give them something

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,140
to get in the hands of kids cheaply and

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,850
younger so that they would get to

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,840
college with a little more experience so

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,670
that's why it's called the pie the pie

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,489
is for Python although obviously you can

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,470
do whatever you want with it the first

00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,790
run was for 10,000 boards because they

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,400
assume that was all that they could ever

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,600
possibly sell and they sold a hundred

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,220
thousand on the first day crash the

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,630
websites at both sites that were selling

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,820
them and like he said now we're at three

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,470
million boards so who knows what this is

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:20,630
any funny

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:23,930
who said it what is it BAM BBC micro

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:26,330
this was the source of inspiration for

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,849
the pot the BBC micro came out in

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,560
December of 1981 and there was a model a

00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,510
and a model be just like the Raspberry

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,010
Pi is it had a two megahertz processor

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:39,260
and you could choose 16 or 32 k of RAM

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,480
nobody's ever need that much RAM ever an

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,400
app where you can see was intended for

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,720
education it was the whole concept and

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,930
this was what inspired him to create the

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,370
pie and so there is the friendly

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,200
neighborhood pie and all the things that

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,760
you get with it are you guys pretty

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,440
familiar like most of you said you have

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,900
once you know these visits and we can

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,130
get to the more fun parts of this so

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:05,390
what's the difference between that one

00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:07,370
and this one well that's one of the

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,380
differences absolutely yeah yeah so this

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,599
is one of the newer board the easiest

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,920
way to tell when you have about 4,000 of

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
these not floating around your house and

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,560
you can't remember how long it's been

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,320
there and you don't have to plug it in

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,539
and find out is the mounting hole not

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,650
mounting holes that are there and handy

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,640
looking at you that's how I can tell

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,210
which one of those when I pull it out of

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,810
the box or you can actually plug it in

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,630
and do this and so the result if you get

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,280
two through six it's a model be with 256

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,260
on the ramp if it's seven through nine

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,570
it's the model a with 256 and then the

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,850
letter is d e and F are the bottle p

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,140
with 512 so if you really do pulled out

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,090
of the box you're like I don't know what

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,860
do I got here this is how you can find

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,180
out and all these slides are online you

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,530
don't have to scribble or take pictures

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,010
or any of that lacking us I'll tell you

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,419
where to find them so now you got you

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,740
get to go by parks because it's the best

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,380
part you get to go shopping and find

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,000
things that build with and so a friend

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,150
just asked me a couple of days ago she

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,680
wants to send a pie to her nieces and

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,270
nephews

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,520
she want to know what should I send with

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,780
it because they're in China and you

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,400
think that made it easier to get parts

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,169
but apparently it wherever they are much

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,910
harder to get parts she said what should

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,289
I send them and I said figure out what

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,789
they're going to do with it and then buy

00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,990
parts I think a lot of the kids you can

00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,280
buy a lot of these beginning with high

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,610
kids and what you get is an overpriced

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,660
pie and a lot of LEDs so figure out what

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,539
you want to do and then you can go

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,800
shopping adafruit has all of the things

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,600
in the world because of magical

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
wonderland what I wish Radio Shack was

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,509
that I could just drive across the

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,220
street and go to Radio Shack and why all

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,470
the things but it is not it is a diff

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,880
route and it's online sparkfun is

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,500
getting a lot more raspberry pi stuff

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,410
and so if you want the tiny parts and

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,639
little components that's really handy

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,599
and then you know all these all looks

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,740
like the kind of depends on what you

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,759
want to build so just start poking

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,770
around figure out what it is you want

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,240
what it is you need and then you'll find

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,680
the parts and just never bought a

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,509
Raspberry Pi on it was like this or

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,639
fifty dollars it's unreasonable alright

00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:02,979
so let's get started the first thing

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:11,169
that you need is the right SD card words

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:13,870
um so I so estimate well so SD cards are

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,520
generally crap and they count on the

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,409
fact that they're crap because they're

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,659
cheap they are cheap little pieces of

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,220
flash memory shelter inside a cheap

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,840
little plastic case at the lowest

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,190
possible bid whatever is cheaper

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,599
tomorrow will be what is inside it

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,889
tomorrow they will not change the case

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,150
they will not change the revision there

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,470
is no way for you to tell what the

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,389
difference is between the SD card that

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,860
you bought at CVS and Walgreens they're

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,389
not the same even the packaging the

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,699
label everything looks the same so

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:40,000
you're playing crapshoot with SD cards

00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,590
anyways so the best thing you can do is

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,389
look for a manufacturer that is less

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,030
crap than the rest of them and so

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,340
there's a list on a Linux tour ealing

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,349
sod org is an embedded linux website and

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,330
they have a ton of high quality material

00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,289
about the Raspberry Pi they're the most

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,909
valuable thing we're talking about right

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,620
now is this list of SD cards where

00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:58,419
people have said I bought this SD card

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,159
it worked really well or I bought this

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:05,849
SD card and a burn my house down so some

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,849
of the faster

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,920
when SD cards go bad they go really bad

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,960
so there used to be a class 10 bug

00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,700
they're probably still is a class 10 bug

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,300
depending on their cards again I did

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,100
reference how crap they are so some

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,960
people have reported failures with using

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,390
the micro SD cards with an adapter to

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,070
get them to the full size to be honest

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,960
that's all we ever use and it's all

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,060
everybody else sells as the part of the

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,500
kits so it works just fine don't worry

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,060
about it it's not the adapters fault it

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,480
is the crap SD you put inside the

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,900
adapter that's to blame and they will

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,790
burn out over time so don't invest a ton

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,890
of money in a super big super expensive

00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,730
SD card only to be her twin three months

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:52,530
later it doesn't do anything pretty much

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,850
any phrase that you need help with and

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,350
raspberry pi you're going to end up on

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,120
this a Linux website which is a

00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,100
fantastic wiki full of all sorts of

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,750
Raspberry Pi hopeful information and

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,580
this particular one goes to their list

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,960
of SD cards where people have reported I

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,850
tried the Kingston 16 gig class 6 card

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,290
and it didn't work in your spot and so

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,400
you can actually go check and figure out

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,800
if that's where your problems coming

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:19,169
from horny don't be helpful in report as

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,000
well so display options so the pie has

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,620
to display outs it has an analog

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,890
composite video which is the yellow port

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,210
and then it has hdmi it supports hdmi 13

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,400
and 14 which is pretty much all you

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,530
would need some of the 15 stuff is you

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,729
know for you know things like 4k TVs and

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,690
whatnot and obviously it's not going to

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,190
support that because it didn't exist

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,539
when it was built it has a dsi connector

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,180
for display out but there's no actual

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,710
supported displays right now so you

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,660
can't just take apart a phone or a

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,740
tablet and then say oh the standard

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,940
connector is here let me just shove it

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,110
in the pie and have things work the

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,730
foamer doesn't know how to drive out to

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,100
those devices the raspberry pi

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,330
foundation is working on a screen for

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,890
the Raspberry Pi that the firmware will

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,070
understand but they haven't quite done

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,360
that that has been working yes but they

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,210
said that about the camera to eventually

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,770
camera did show up there's no vga out on

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,120
the pie so if you were hoping to use an

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,230
old VGA monitor you're going to be out

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,220
of luck unless you buy some sort of

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,960
converter and there's plenty of

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,180
Raspberry Pi sites that have converters

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,870
to vga from the various sports it

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,250
supports but I think

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,960
boring and also big and heavy and I

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,910
don't like to carry them around so fun

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,470
alternative this project is worth

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,850
reading the blog post even if you don't

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,470
have an old Kendall that you want to

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,120
potentially destroy in an attempt to

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,279
turn it to a monitor for raspberry pi

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,600
what I love about it is this guy helps

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,490
you as you're reading it I mean he

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,520
doesn't like you are probably too stupid

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,860
to do it and if you don't understand the

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,710
simple command line option then I don't

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,770
know why you're here look it's worth

00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,120
just reading this but he did and he says

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,110
you probably want to have to kendalls

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,400
cuz you're going to destroy the first

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,480
one and they figure out what you did

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,120
wrong and then you can do it on the

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
second one but you got the old kindle

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,060
working in the screen and now that i

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,620
have a new kindle i might need to try to

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,650
win this to my own although i only have

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,320
one so i can only i'm going to screw up

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,910
the other option or one of many other

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,420
fun options is this thing you know this

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,830
is what is it yeah this is the motorola

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,360
atrix laptop this is a

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,950
five-hundred-dollar accessory for a

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,580
foeman about three years ago and now

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,740
it's 40 bucks on ebay so if you're

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,660
married to me you get to give me forty

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,810
dollar out of date technology for my

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,339
birthday and it's awesome and so

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,360
basically you have a raspberry pi laptop

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,500
it's got the screen it's got the

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,589
keyboard you're good to go the only

00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,300
trick with this is that it requires a

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,279
unicorn of a connector that nobody in

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,350
the world sells the only way to get them

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,940
and the best way to get them is to just

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,410
get on ebay and for two dollars you get

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,000
a giant pack of them and so then when

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,560
you lose one you get to pull out of

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,580
nothing but you also to it it's a eight

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,410
male hdmi to micro male hdmi connector

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,000
is the unicorn we're looking for and so

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,800
we even we needed one in California we

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,940
went to frys I was promised to fry sold

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,150
everything in the world and that was a

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,040
lie and so this guy in our talk was like

00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,360
here I have 1 i've already hollowed it

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,310
out to it fits in the weird little

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,600
connection so this is super fun and easy

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,430
when you need the unicorn connector when

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,660
i got my hands on the pie the first

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,130
thing I thought was when you put a

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,930
touchscreen on this and you know build

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,430
projects around that and of course I saw

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,779
the dsi connector and I thought sweet i

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,100
can just take a part of tablet and put a

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,440
dsi but where he talked about how that

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,930
doesn't actually work so the next thing

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,459
we we started to look at was to try and

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,959
find something that would be USB

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:24,190
connected because the pie has those USB

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,930
ports that makes sense to try to use

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,610
them and

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,750
a fair amount of touch screens that are

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,190
out there that are driven over USB

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,680
unfortunately all of them are

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,960
displaylink and what displaylink is is

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,990
displaylink is basically a separate

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,580
video card device to the the hardware so

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,200
it's not actually using the video on the

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,459
board the Raspberry Pi it's actually

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,360
driving it through something that's

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,649
built into the screen itself and a lot

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,610
of the links distributions that are out

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,750
there for the raspberry pi don't

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,970
actually have support for displaying

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,560
devices compiled in so for your

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,180
convenience the drivers that you would

00:11:52,560 --> 00:12:04,860
want if you were using one specifically

00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:11,459
the mimo 720 sounds working told you it

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:14,450
worked sort of no sound by just wanted

00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,450
to jump in there he had a point tonight

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,750
internet full of them everything is the

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,700
thing on the internet it's kind of scary

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,839
but you'd its symphonies on now the

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,860
downside to this approach is that it

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,510
works great once you get the kernel

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,500
compiled and configured properly but

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,060
you're not going to get any acceleration

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,670
out of the video because you're running

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,709
on a very weak graphics chipset that's

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,510
running over displaylink over USB so

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,830
it's going to be really really dog slow

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,000
for any sort of graphics operations

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,650
you're not going to get the video

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,250
playback like we were just demoing

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,750
inadvertently there so in other systems

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,040
like openelec aren't going to work with

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,750
it without rebuilding the colonel

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,370
raspbmc is not going to work out of the

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:54,000
box on one of those things it won't work

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,589
at all so the other option is to is to

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,180
get a touchscreen device that isn't

00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:58,950
displaylink that's actually you know

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,720
dedicated USB connector and it has a

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,209
proper HDMI connector to connect to the

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,770
main video out on the board and this is

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,690
a mediocre touchscreen every picks up on

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,020
Amazon which is handy of something goes

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,670
wrong

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:14,370
in the connections on the referee fire

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:16,800
somewhere inside your costume so

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,630
building kernels unfortunately all the

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,180
code for the raspberry pi is not yet

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,220
upstream some of it is but when we first

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,050
wrote the talk none of it was they have

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,280
a github fork of the Linux kernel that

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,260
they keep reasonably current and they

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,630
track upstream colonel revisions pretty

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,310
well and then they make add their

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,410
changes to it at their specific drivers

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,430
they need the changes to the arm code

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,020
based on orders that both the

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,430
architecture and the hardware and there

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,590
is a process to try and merge all of

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,610
these back into the upstream but for

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,930
those of you who wanted to start and

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,310
build your own kernel in raspberry pi

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,960
you need to check out one of these

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,520
branches from their github and the

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,230
commands for doing that are on the

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,010
screen the first command you would want

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:56,850
to run is make mr. proper not Ruth mr.

00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:02,850
Probert is an interactive talk you know

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:04,410
why is it yeah so make mr. proper is a

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,990
super-duper version of made clean

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:13,110
because internationally mr. clean is

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:14,130
called mr. Prager you've got your SD

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,630
card you figured out what you're going

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,150
to do now you need to distro for the job

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,590
as red-hot Fedora people we have

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,330
something of an inclination towards

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,830
pedorra it's what we tend to use in our

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,270
projects however we also tell you that

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,650
you should use this is true that is

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,480
appropriate to what you were building

00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:30,180
and so if you would like to use XBMC

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,700
under 5 you should use raspbmc that is

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,490
one step and you're done you should use

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,130
that that is what is designed for if you

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,150
are a hardcore hardware tinker and you

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,760
want to get into that you should check

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,280
out occidentalis which if a de fruits

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,470
raspbian based distribution they call it

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,060
for education but that's a lot like when

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,960
you start reading the words they say if

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,190
you don't know what you're doing you

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,240
shouldn't be using this distro and I'm

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,000
like well then maybe it's not for

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,280
education is it and then there are many

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,230
many other options and this is a teeny

00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,820
tiny fraction of the long long list of

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,110
distros that have been made for the pie

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,760
and so if

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,350
these doesn't suit you you're welcome to

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,579
go off and make your own sister which

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,740
occasionally somebody tells us they're

00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:11,459
going to do it I don't know why we mock

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,839
those people endlessly but of course we

00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,550
are that's obligated to tell you that

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,350
fight or is awesome and you should use

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,019
it and my favorite pipe or a feature

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,850
will always be the as soon as I looked

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,140
at the list what I know is that if you

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,670
want to go headless and you never want

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,529
to have to drive around and monitor like

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,089
my life involves figuring out ways not

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,399
to take a monitor up and down the three

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,959
stories in my house and so if you always

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,120
want to go headless you add a little

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,339
file to your SD card before you boot it

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,870
up in the pie and pie Dora will blink

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,760
out the IP address through the LEDs and

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,680
read it to you through the speakers a

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,740
delighted label British accent it's very

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,560
lovely there's also an option called

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,990
noobs and so if if you are using it to

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,640
teach a kid about linux or if you just

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,649
want to screw around and see what comes

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,240
up news is a good place to start stands

00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:55,829
for new out of box software and this is

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
what you see when you boot up the pie

00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,250
for the first time and so you get to

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,260
pick which distro you want to run it

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,610
does that then you start typing some

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,200
stuff you've completely borked it it's

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,399
not working anymore you hold down shift

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,690
it boot you get the menu again and

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,279
you're gonna coo over without talking to

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:15,060
flash your cardigan super handy I got

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,399
this slide no that was a good summary

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,300
weakish me right on no inevitably was

00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,620
sooner or later we get suppression

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,149
answer somebody goes can I put android

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,070
on it yes you can it's a dumb idea it

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,930
runs really slowly it's hard to compile

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,970
and you should just go to this R as

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,769
droid wiki page download their ancient

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,940
image proof to yourself it's terrible

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,940
and slow and then never ever do it again

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,190
now you need to get a distro onto your

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,660
card whether or not you like the door

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,279
this is easiest way in the world to do

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,870
it the fedora arm installer you just

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,490
click your SD card took a distro click

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,079
do it and it's done you don't have to go

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,529
to the command line you don't have to do

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,670
anything but of course you can you can

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,310
go to the command line if you're on a

00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,569
Mac there's a little option called RPI

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,500
SD card builder if you're on Windows

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:58,149
don't know we're here so or if you would

00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,740
like to skip everything that we just

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,360
said you just didn't Adafruit buy

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,940
yourself a card preloaded with noobs and

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,290
you're good to go then you skip the

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,240
problems with SD cards and picking a

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,650
distro you just bought neste card if

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,030
you're like me you have a drawer full of

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,260
them because every time you go on

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:16,140
vacation you're like purred my SD card

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,209
you go by through warfare camera power

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,339
so how many of you in here with a

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:24,370
raspberry pi have seen it do something

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:26,079
weird something unexplained like you

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,600
start typing and it doesn't type and

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,210
then the old oaks doesn't give you that

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,610
Tiki like a hundred times power is why

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,700
it did that the Raspberry Pi wants five

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,679
volts at one amps and no less no more

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,030
you give it more or less it starts to

00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,169
get unhappy now it has reasonable

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,010
tolerances with an arrangement will

00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,940
continue to run but things get weird now

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,169
the first thing you want to do is you

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,510
want to make sure that you have a clean

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,809
5 volt 1 amp feed coming into your eyes

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:57,280
berry pie now most of us hopefully have

00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:59,860
android phones and micro USB connector

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,510
for power charging and maybe even you

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,890
plugged it into your laptop and said hey

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,390
I'm just going to run my pie off of my

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,429
laptop and you say hey this seems to

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,130
work and then you get weird random odd

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,740
behavior most likely because you're not

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,620
getting clean 5 volt 1 amp off of that

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,840
cord a lot of the phone chargers that

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,830
are out there serve very well to charge

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,750
your phone because your phone does not

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,070
need 5 volts at one amp in order to

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,750
charge its battery it will happily

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,000
trickle charge in a much longer window

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,830
of time but if you do give it 5 volts at

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,450
1am say will charge a lot faster but

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,409
that would be more expensive so why

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,640
would they do that though just though

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,830
the cheap plug in there and you're good

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,990
to go so if you want to have a reliable

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,090
Raspberry Pi go out to Adafruit or your

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,480
favorite electronic site and find a 5

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,010
volt 1 amp power cord plug set up and

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
you will automatically be in a better

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,430
position now the second complexity about

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,580
power on the Raspberry Pi

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:52,540
is that the ports USB ports on the

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Raspberry Pi are low power USB ports 95

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,560
to ninety-nine percent of your devices

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,260
that you have with USB connectors are

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,520
high power USB devices there is a

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,440
difference in the standard and

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,300
specification so when you plug in an

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,100
high powered device to a port that's

00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,840
only providing low power it will do the

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,370
best that they can and some of the high

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,890
power devices can actually run at the

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,390
low power standard but what happens far

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,280
more often is you go to plug your

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,480
keyboard in with fancy features that you

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,310
don't care about but came with the

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
keyboard anyways because you can't just

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,110
buy a simple keyboard anymore it also

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,780
has to make toast or you plug in and

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,580
Wi-Fi dongle it will detect the driver

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,580
will load and then the device will go

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,900
well I'm done and stop working Linux is

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,620
like hey i lured a device driver I don't

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,330
know why things aren't working

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,860
everything was good to me and it's

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,870
because of the power gap between the

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,300
devices the way to work around this is

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,160
to put a powered USB hub between your

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,690
device and the pie so that you can

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,120
guarantee that you have that high power

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,260
and by powered I mean not you plug it

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,930
back into the pie to feed power to it

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,760
but rather that you yes but rather

00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:58,510
you've actually plugged it physically

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,950
into the wall with a with a brick so put

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,810
a hub put a power brick on your shopping

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,400
list do this before you start any sort

00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:10,920
of project and your life will be much

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,920
much much happier no

00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:17,510
two hours super handy for your portable

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,770
projects but I have noticed that in fact

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,450
this is one of them they started selling

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,480
for were these with a 1 amp output and

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:27,410
it's you may have outfit that day which

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,940
point the iPads on the android tablets

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,679
needs a 2 amp and so that's why they do

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:36,309
that c6 did we mention c6 we should

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,309
mention see sex

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,660
don't buy the cheapest ones from China

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,190
that you possibly can because sometimes

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,690
they will back power and will run power

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,640
back over and there's no protection

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,760
built in the pie for it to be expecting

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,380
power in fact there are USB hubs that

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,540
are built specifically for the Raspberry

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,190
Pi there's even one that's built with

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,020
just the right amount of back power

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,490
across it so that you can power it off

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,830
the hub and not need a separate source

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:15,130
if you're really concerned there's

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:18,640
several but yeah so don't buy something

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,710
that looks like it came in a freebie bin

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,090
somewhere I mean anything you buy that

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,440
has a name brand that you reasonably

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,500
were recognized is not going to be a bad

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,170
one belkin linksys any USB hub from a

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,290
vendor that doesn't appear to only exist

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,820
in a website somewhere so seasick if

00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,930
you've ever opened up your pie to be oh

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,930
yes sorry

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:52,630
power strip and five bricks I mean again

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,400
what you need is you need five volts at

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,710
one amp running to each PI across a

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,450
micro USB connector how you deliver that

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,220
you know what them you have you have to

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,720
start with a micro USB connector but if

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,190
you're clever and you want to wire all

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,190
of those into a single power supply and

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,750
then step down the power to each those

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,100
level on each one of those cords I've

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,910
seen people who have built clusters who

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,020
have taken like a PC power supply and

00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,370
run it through circuit boards to step

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,900
down the power to the just the right

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,130
amount for the pie so that they have one

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,840
power supply that's powering the whole

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,280
cluster a lot of the websites that talk

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,840
about doing clustered Raspberry Pi talk

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,800
about how they have power supplies and a

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,350
couple of those people are actually

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,360
selling power supplies specifically for

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,130
that purpose so they have a one power

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,200
supply that has a whole bunch of clean 5

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,380
volt 1 amp micro USB cords coming off of

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,380
it

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:49,360
well the pie has no feelings but but but

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,540
but but but it will it will emit the

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,310
magic smoke and refuse to work it's an

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,840
option I mean it's a one-time show it's

00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:00,220
kind of like when Daffy Duck says this

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,780
is a great show but only one time I'm

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,120
sorry and the question was will it hurt

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,710
the the pie to put two amps and while

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,270
the pie has no feelings there will be a

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,220
one time and once I will be performance

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,950
of magic smoke yeah the pie is tolerant

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,530
within within point one amps of the one

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,360
amp recommended so it will run for

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,520
varying degrees of running at point nine

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,990
and one point one but anything more than

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:25,390
that it will just go and die so your pie

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,310
came with this really cool thumb holder

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:31,210
right by the power it's my favorite

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:32,740
feature that's fuggin accepting the

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,840
first time you do that that capacitor

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,580
ring fob and so when you need to replace

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,110
it this is what your google to solder

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,090
back on and the black scribe goes for

00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,010
the outside your pie will probably still

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,450
run without it but should you decide

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,090
that you would like that capacitor in

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,500
your life this is how you get it back

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,420
now what your pie does not have despite

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,810
its many cool features is an on-off

00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,030
switch this is a fixable problem you

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,830
solder to little header pins in right

00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,300
behind the magic thumb holder right

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,530
there in those two little holes you

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,530
short them out you have an on/off switch

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,000
so you wanna you want to test your

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,990
voltage plug in all of your peripherals

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,940
all the stuff that you're going to use

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,070
in your project set your multimeter 220

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,750
volts you touch the red one to can you

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,040
guys see yet the little teepee one is

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,560
labeled on the side you're going to need

00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,570
your old person glasses sometimes to see

00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,060
the labels on here but such a red lead

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,120
to TP one and the black one to TP two

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,800
and you need to be seeing 4.8 and if

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,370
you're not seeing 4.8 you have found the

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,990
problem with your setup you really want

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,820
to see 5 but if you see poor boy Nate

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,710
didn't you're in or ballpark at least

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,570
you at least know that that's not

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,060
perhaps the biggest problem you have you

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,740
may have done something else wrong you

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,510
can also test there used to be I think

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,039
three Pollock uses but now they're down

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,049
to one

00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,359
views on the backside of that little

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:49,830
teepee to label and you can test that

00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,809
too but instead of plugging in all your

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,119
peripherals take everything out and then

00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:56,580
touch one lead 2 tp2 and the other 2 f 3

00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,899
which is on the back on the SD card side

00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,399
and that'll tell you the voltage coming

00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:00,989
from the fuse you switch to the other

00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:02,159
side tells you the voltage coming in and

00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:03,960
so if you're having power problems

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,989
that's how you test and find out what's

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,299
going on they also gave you a

00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,979
handy-dandy little strip of LEDs in a

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,840
corner to tell you what's going wrong

00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:15,059
with your power problems usually or with

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,590
one of the files on your SD card and so

00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,509
most of the cases have my handy-dandy

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,919
little hole here so that you can see

00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:20,879
what's going on with the LEDs and if

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,989
you're building your own case you should

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:23,759
probably leave yourself a way to see

00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,929
your LEDs and what's going on unless you

00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,340
know that you've done all the right

00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:27,720
things on your SD card and all your

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,399
power is right nothing bad is going to

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,570
happen then I guess you can just paint

00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:31,619
right over them you don't need I want to

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,080
meet those people that have that

00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:37,349
scenario nothing ever goes wrong with my

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,119
projects ever ever ever and so this is

00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,039
what the lights will tell you there are

00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,450
slightly different codes for the lights

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,070
on the older pi so if that one's been

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,349
sitting in a desk drawer for a really

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,759
long time if you go to that clinic set

00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:49,229
or excited I talked about earlier it

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:54,899
will tell you what the lights mean for

00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:56,700
older pies gpio which is the my favorite

00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,940
part of the pie is general-purpose

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,440
input/output pins this is a pin that

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,590
some of them have special powers a

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,419
couple of them are serial console pins

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:09,239
some of them are pulse width modulation

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,649
pins some of them are power pins all of

00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,149
these are software customizable so you

00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,979
can go into Linux and say this pin is

00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:15,359
now this this pin is now that leave the

00:26:13,979 --> 00:26:16,679
power pins alone nobody wants that

00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,789
surprise when you've converted into a

00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,109
general purpose pin and you don't know

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:24,989
why you're not getting five volts out of

00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:29,700
it you can put data in you can send data

00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:32,009
out there are there is 15 volt pin most

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,080
of them are 3.3 all the general-purpose

00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:36,659
i/o pins are expecting 3.3 volts across

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,249
them and not 5 volt so don't program any

00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,629
Arduino projects that are expecting 5

00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:42,139
volts across the pins because the pi

00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:44,429
will then again omit the magic smoke

00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:47,340
there is no voltage protection coming

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:49,019
back in you can run your power across

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,190
the GPIO and there's lots of people that

00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,340
have discussed doing this I don't

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,749
recommend it because the mini the micro

00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,300
USB port that the power normally comes

00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:58,700
in has voltage protection to

00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,170
I am prevent you know crazy scenarios

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,400
from you know emitting the magic smoke

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:06,080
the GPIO has no such protection so but

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,000
it's also important remember that when

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,380
they Reeve a revised the Raspberry Pi to

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,780
update and add more memory they went

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,400
ahead and renumber all the pins again so

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:17,030
there's two numberings of pins that are

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,220
out there the old and the new and so I i

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,290
think our favorite hack is really the

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,220
one that helps you understand what pin

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:28,040
is what number they are not labeled for

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,050
your convenience so this guy you may be

00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,270
interested in his name is dr. Simon monk

00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,060
and not only did he make a raspberry pi

00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,460
cluster but he makes it just which is he

00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,720
calls the raspberry leaf and it you

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,490
printed out on a piece of paper you

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,870
later over there now you have cheap and

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,720
they're both super handy and you can

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,220
even Adafruit now sells the little metal

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,700
ones that you can lie on there so that

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,320
it's more permanent best project ever

00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,910
now let's say that you want to run

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,200
something on the pie and the good news

00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,730
is is that at this point the

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,170
distributions that are out there for the

00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,280
Raspberry Pi have a lot of the software

00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,080
that you probably want to run already

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,790
precompiled pre optimized for the

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,890
Raspberry Pi but let's just say that you

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,170
have something new you can compile your

00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,590
thing on the pie and then you can go to

00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:10,640
war and come back and it might be done

00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,690
it's going to take a while the bigger

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,670
the code the longer it's going to take

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,290
the pie is not a speed demon by any

00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,720
means and you really see how slow it is

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,760
when you go to compile things on it so

00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,940
you want to compile a kernel don't do it

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,230
on the PI build a cross compiler

00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,000
cross-compiling used to be sort of a

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,710
black art where you would have to get a

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,020
virgin a bucket full of frogs and the

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,180
right moon and have it all come together

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:36,280
perfectly so that you could you know get

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:41,180
across compiler that actually worked but

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:44,570
yeah well the virgin ran away so cross

00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:46,280
to angie is now available for you to

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,900
have this all simplified so across 21 g

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,850
is basically a front-end it looks very

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,200
much like the end curses front-end to

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,760
building the willing kernel itself and

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,500
it walks you through the options you

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,150
tell it what optimizations you want what

00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,560
kind of target you're building for what

00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,480
languages you want to build support for

00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,370
what additional libraries you want to

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,890
build to add on to the environment and

00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,730
then you can hit enter on that and it

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,900
will go through and pull down the

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,880
sources and build everything the way

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,870
that you want it we actually have a

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,070
whole chapter in the book to talk

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,450
about how to build a cross compiler

00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,240
that's perfectly optimized for the

00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,190
Raspberry Pi environment so now that I

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,020
told you how to do things you're going

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,660
to do look at the things that other

00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,309
people felt like a super fun most of

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,590
them involve a case and that is a really

00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:26,480
great first project because as someone

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,550
who has a lot of naked pies flowing

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,230
around the house it feels worse than a

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:35,150
lego when you step on those GPI okay

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,559
cases are good so you have a lot of

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,870
options you can make one out of all

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,730
sorts of materials you can 3d print one

00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,500
which is probably the best cases that we

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,000
have had are the ones that came off of

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,590
the 3d printer and then you can even

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,690
make it look whatever you like whatever

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,190
you want to look like you can buy one

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,250
there are lots of cases out there some

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,690
of them are really bad we bought some i

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,220
think i'll pay 80 fruit so if you find

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,980
one that's a black bottom and a clear

00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,020
lid it break when you try to put things

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,210
together it breaks off these pieces that

00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,160
hold the SD card in which is a terrible

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:07,010
feature in a cave and so then you end up

00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,780
super gluing a steamer than your pie at

00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:12,320
the problem then you end up super glued

00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,270
to a pie and it's awkward or at one time

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,890
a guy i said this in a guy raises hand

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,450
and he said I have the best case and he

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,950
holds it up and he had the cardboard box

00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,950
that it comes in and he did exacto it

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:24,020
out around all over for like all right

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,929
well of the easiest case to me but my

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,170
favorites are made out of lego because I

00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:33,080
like Legos there are lots of great

00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,820
artists cases this is what if you just

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,050
Google like a raspberry pi pace you're

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,960
going to be in the rabbit hole all the

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:43,370
way through lunch it's super fun there's

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,530
another one I like this one this ad says

00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,030
that he notes in his photos that the

00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,490
Raspberry Pi command center is fully

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,210
OSHA iso9001 ask me I Triple E and

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,210
sarbanes-oxley compliance

00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:59,570
there is also a kit to build this

00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:01,009
particular Lego case and I could give

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,929
you the whole dissertation it will be

00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,789
happy to later at the fedora booth about

00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,590
the appropriate price per brick that you

00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,359
should be paying for legos this does not

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,919
have an appropriate price perfect for a

00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,059
she also you have to order from the UK

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,659
and so your shipping is going to be

00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,859
insane you can build with my goes the

00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,239
only good feature here is you get the

00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,739
little round thing and the to bring both

00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:20,179
you get a leave you think it out of Lego

00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:26,139
store they call the bin so it's there

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:26,139
for steal your kids like us yeah

00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:32,509
designed by a girlf capture all right

00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:34,099
great Girl Scout sorry as many of you

00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,649
said the first thing that you did was

00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:39,349
turn it into a little htpc but XBMC on

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:40,700
there that's what raspbmc does literally

00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:42,349
all you have to do is flash the card to

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,869
grab me up see plug it in and do a

00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:47,149
little bit of setup it's SuperDuper easy

00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,710
and then you have a Raspberry Pi project

00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:50,869
and you get to sit back and watch TV and

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,970
it took you about 10 minutes if you do

00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:54,769
this and you think hey there's a USB

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,489
port coming off the back of my TV and

00:31:54,769 --> 00:32:02,529
you have weird behavior issues remember

00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:05,419
what I said about power just just beware

00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:07,759
my seven-year-old set it up it's not

00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:09,590
easy but I love this guy this is one of

00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,899
the comments on the raspbmc page it

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,039
basically said I can go up some stuff I

00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:16,029
don't know what I'm doing but now i'm

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,029
watching TV yeah

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,700
this is learn from my errors sort of

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,860
lessons but it is also a lesson in how

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,480
the pie is pretty resilient and we'll do

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,790
some of the stupid things but you

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,290
suggest that it means you so we got

00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,910
together when we first got a bunch of

00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,230
our raspberry PI's and started thinking

00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,429
what should we build and we bought a

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,690
bunch of crap online it would bought a

00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,920
bunch of crab at radioshack i would

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,660
start plugging things together and I'm

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,400
like all right I'm going to take apart

00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,809
an old gameboy and I'm going to shove a

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,950
pie in there with a tiny screen and I'm

00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,570
gonna have a little raspberry pi Game

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,400
Boy and actually just about a week or

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,290
two ago there was a project going around

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,940
online where someone had had a much more

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,400
successful in point with this and I did

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,910
so my biggest problem in fitting it all

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,920
in there is that giant RCA connector

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:58,929
that is in the way if your case the red

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,820
the Game Boy case is about that big and

00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:02,679
that connector comes out like that far

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,410
so it's a fixable problem but i'm too

00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:06,850
lazy at vixen point of this story is we

00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,559
got this set up in the florida office

00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,080
you can see our lovely awesome carpet at

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,000
the top of it and this is not how you

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,679
should connect thanks to the GPIO but I

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,080
was incredibly impatient and I under

00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:21,400
connectors we have no time for soldering

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,890
and so the picture that i really wish i

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,809
had is me looking directly down on the

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:29,320
top apply making sure the teeny tiny out

00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:30,700
here posting anything else also at the

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,620
time so this is a little too and a half

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,690
inch TFT screen that we bought off beta

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,040
fruit and at the time there was no

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,390
documentation with it there was not even

00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,559
a datasheet there was absolutely nothing

00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,230
it was just like here you go how about

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,460
teeny-tiny blogger now there is and that

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:49,200
monitor requires 12 volts of power but

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,200
as you can see is not happening

00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,289
yeah it appears to be really tolerant of

00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:58,630
5 volts but if you had it so I call this

00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:01,720
my 5 boy if you had a pee you get-a

00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,070
pitboy and this is another guy's project

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,840
he saw the Raspberry Pi in slot

00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,270
halloween costume which i did too except

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,510
he wanted to put it on his arm and so he

00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:12,940
built the pip-boy from fallout used some

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,010
version of polymorph to make the casing

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,570
around it except it all shorted out

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,280
about an hour before the party so he

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,990
walked around with a dead pit boy on his

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,490
arm but he has a great blog about it if

00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,260
you just Google Raspberry Pi pip-boy you

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,179
can read all about the build I think if

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,619
he's still rebuilding up for like two

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:30,909
years so I'm a gamer and one of the

00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:35,020
things i wanted to do with the pie was

00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:36,520
to emulate video games across it to pre

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,950
empty inevitable question yes it does

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:43,419
play minecraft no i don't care but the

00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:46,060
the pie is capable of emulating pretty

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:48,520
much up to a playstation one with some

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,580
degree of success and so nintendo super

00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,099
nintendo game boy game boy advance

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:56,710
genesis atari all these games even the

00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:58,420
main stack will run on the Raspberry Pi

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,580
and in fact the main emulator is what we

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,410
have on the costume so that people could

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,089
walk up and play old school arcade games

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,560
on Soundwave we felt that was more

00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:07,750
fitting than running position one games

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,339
on sound wave if you're playing in

00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,760
advanced mode I start running back and

00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,869
forth while you attempt to play Frogger

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,770
that's what I do to kids who decide to

00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:19,330
punch the robot but I shown here playing

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,400
Super Metroid and again any of the games

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,050
in that family are going to run really

00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,339
well on the PI the emulator is already

00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,630
well optimized for it you don't have to

00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,859
do any of the work most of it is just

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,720
going out downloading the emulator

00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:30,460
putting it in play there's a couple

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
different sites out there for pre-built

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,369
projects that will suck in all the known

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,599
emulators put it all into a nice menu

00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,520
structure for you and then you just have

00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,839
to feed get roms I don't know where you

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,470
would get roms it's not like you can

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,020
google that so don't ask if you like

00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,400
your games itty bitty this is an option

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,070
that's a cigarette lighter for sale

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,670
because they

00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:51,200
bananas for scale what I love about this

00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,610
project other than the fact that it is

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,140
itty bitty and I might not have been

00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:57,080
enough vision to play on a screen that

00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,610
tiny is that on sprites mods calm you

00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,780
can see all of the directions for

00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:05,900
building this yourself they look like

00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:07,610
this which is everything you need to

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,630
know but I love that he's just like you

00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,980
know what I'm gonna scribbled on the

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,280
back of the napkin I'm going to stand in

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,720
you want to know that it's on you buddy

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,840
adafruit also now suffice they call it

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,760
the cut cave which is a 120 dollar kit I

00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,020
think to effectively do the same thing

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,340
but you already have the little cabinet

00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,470
made and the buttons and everything you

00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,780
don't have to put it all down the cup k

00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:29,510
is actually slightly bigger the sprites

00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,420
mod he actually had to cut the pie in

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:38,090
half to get it to fit in that size

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:39,260
format yeah so yeah yeah you just have

00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:45,230
to go and find her arms and all of that

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,970
but you know I think it's actually the

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:54,470
same size screen were showing off for

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:56,270
the is it yeah it's it's a TFT it's not

00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,560
a we've only seen one in person ones

00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,470
because somebody brought us who are

00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:04,310
talking probably yeah he back he begged

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:06,980
me for roms for like 20 minutes so this

00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:08,690
is my favorite version so we were in

00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,190
what we called the best bar in the world

00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,510
it's as far as Paris is totally geek

00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,040
theme there's money in Falcon on the

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,210
wall even heard that whole story it also

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,700
is available at the fedora beers later

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,080
or anywhere you find me but they had

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,980
these i call it the pizza hut table

00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,660
because that's where i remember seeing

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,190
that when i was a kid it's the the tape

00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,330
that cause like coffee table and has the

00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,220
games and it flips back and forth the

00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,810
player 1 player 2 and this was the

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,840
moment I realized that every good idea i

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,760
have somebody who's already

00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,230
because if you just apparently everybody

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,460
else tells the people at table to put

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,290
that's what I google first Raspberry Pi

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,610
peapod gave me tingle and there are a

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,180
bunch of them this is one of them that

00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:43,320
on instructables i like them ikea and a

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,270
pie and you're gonna go oh so the the

00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,640
second part of that everything i can

00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,950
think of has already been made came if

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,450
we work at Red Hat and we have several

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,860
mailing list there's an all company

00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,740
mailing list and then local ones breach

00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,230
office and a friend emailed our local

00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,240
office mailing list and said hey

00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,590
wondering if anybody has a Geiger

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,590
counter I could borrow for the weekend

00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:12,900
that was the whole message and so I

00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:15,090
messaged him on IRC and said what do and

00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,950
he said he did not say what he was doing

00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:21,270
he said great could you build me a

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:26,100
Raspberry Pi Geiger counter apparently I

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:27,630
could yeah the back story behind why

00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,610
there is a Raspberry Pi Geiger counters

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,070
kasia kind of interesting Fukushima

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,390
Japan the government was telling the

00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,980
locals that live nearby that there was

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,870
nothing to worry about and one of the

00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,310
local hackers of the nearby makerspace

00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,080
was like I do not trust you I do not

00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,280
believe you and so he got a Raspberry Pi

00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,750
and he built himself a Geiger counter

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,070
out of it and posted the parts online

00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,540
and encouraged everyone around him to

00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,860
build them and hand them out to the

00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,320
local so they could actually know what

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,610
the radiation level was near their house

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,990
yeah the if you would like to know why

00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,730
he was looking for a Geiger counter his

00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,970
uncle had brought him a railroad spike

00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:01,560
from oshima and he wanted to know what

00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:02,640
was coming off of it if you actually do

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,830
decide that you like to use the

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,810
Raspberry Pi for an educational purpose

00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:08,520
for say a child instead of building

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:12,000
robot costumes which is an entirely

00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,990
valid choice there is a fantastic book i

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,560
love called super Scratch programming

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,150
adventure and obviously you can use it

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,920
with scratch on your larger linux

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,660
machine but most of the Raspberry Pi

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,910
jestro's cub was scratched already

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,260
installed my kid kind of freaks out now

00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,570
she finds a computer that does nardi

00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,760
have scratch on it so the way this book

00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,840
is designed is a comic book on the left

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,940
and if you're not familiar with scratch

00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,530
the little cat up there is the mascot of

00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,330
scratch and so he's what you see you can

00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,070
make the catwalk dance talk to spin in

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,750
circles whatever and so you have this

00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,490
comic book and the cat is in peril

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,870
something happens to the cat and then on

00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,460
the right you have all the steps to go

00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,500
through in scratch to solve it and what

00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,420
scratch does for you is make the bits of

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,920
code into puzzle pieces and so when you

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,660
visit puzzle pieces together your code

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,250
works and at the end of the book you

00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,810
have a video game that you built and you

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,220
get to play and that's really satisfying

00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,420
as a kid like I didn't just go through

00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,590
this book and learn some crap and now I

00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,940
have to figure out what to do with it I

00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:05,220
actually have something that I can do

00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,750
this is another good educational tool

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,120
it's called google coder is a google

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,760
apps project and so you install google

00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,010
coder on the pie and then you access it

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,680
from your laptop or whatever with chrome

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,360
and this is what you see and so gadget

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,190
oh it is sort of like an asteroids game

00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,770
iball the pair of eyeballs that follow

00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,170
your mouse around the screen hello coder

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,090
I don't remember it as much of nothing

00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,080
and the much market for you get to start

00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:35,220
on your own and so it helps you learn

00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:37,200
HTML nodejs CSS and some basic

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,970
JavaScript I think and so you have

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,830
options you can this is the gadget or

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,750
the asteroids game this is the basic out

00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,370
of eight until you just go edit it maybe

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,110
I want size five rocks and set of size

00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,290
two rocks and things like that and you

00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,270
see how editing those very

00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,860
rules changes the result and then you

00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,240
can go in and you can actually edit all

00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,440
the code directly so this is what you

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,480
get if you just want to start from

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,160
scratch and you write it in any feed on

00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,510
the right and you get to play with the

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,030
ones that they've built and then figure

00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,730
it out on the ground or just kind of and

00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,710
this is this is just a great example of

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:08,680
people using these out in the wild this

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,780
is a solar-powered Raspberry Pi lab at a

00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,300
school in Ghana they don't have power

00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,720
but they have Sun they have lots lots of

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,370
fun and and so there's a composition

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,020
called power potential that's working on

00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:23,770
putting these in a bunch of other

00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:25,960
schools there they serve with three

00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,580
schools a total and now they're going to

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,570
do three schools in each of the 30

00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,570
regions in Tanzania

00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:40,420
federer stored up a lot of solar power

00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:43,720
first but if you happen to live in in

00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:47,859
Ghana or Tanzania less of a problem lots

00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:50,920
more Sun and way less rain unless

00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:52,749
educational pursuits perhaps you wanted

00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,480
the costume instead of teaching your

00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:58,089
child something and so this guy decided

00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:03,069
to build himself a fun little he goes

00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:04,359
with the pile Orion oh we're not getting

00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:05,859
the found out but you can see what you

00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:08,140
got the whole flexp paws forgot the

00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:10,509
whole big guy I do not think that it

00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:14,170
actually results in time travel but I

00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:15,490
can't swear what your is this I don't

00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,569
that guy doesn't look like you at all

00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:25,029
you're doing a really good job with the

00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:26,589
costumes lightning well if you're

00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:30,749
wearing too willing to wear a little

00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:33,059
necklace of uranium ore or mr. fusion

00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:35,200
there are also lots of home automation

00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:36,640
projects turning on and off your lights

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,170
and doing things like the AT&T

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,369
commercial with the people on the front

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,019
porch you were like my stupid kids

00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:42,880
didn't turn off the lights but I like

00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:45,000
this one because they put a star trek

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,830
helper

00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,450
microphone meant a lot of me of my house

00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:59,580
I might as well be living in the 24th

00:42:48,450 --> 00:43:04,500
century right this guy has not yet

00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:07,050
completed his project talking about this

00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,540
play to years so his problem is he knew

00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,390
how to build the chevrons at all and has

00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,010
this he has a life-sized Star Gate or is

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,420
he refers to a functioning Stargate I

00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,530
think the finger quotes have never been

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,650
more appropriate than in the phrase

00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,600
functioning started but he wanted to use

00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,130
raspberry PI's to make the lights and

00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,100
the sounds and all of that and perhaps

00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,630
the functioning part but he doesn't know

00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,190
anything about a pie or programming or

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,570
how to get started so if you are willing

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,940
to be the bottle piece and the

00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,320
functioning Stargate puzzled Stargate

00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,850
project he has all this funding all

00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,590
these companies funding it I'm like how

00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,360
team not find somebody just to make some

00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:41,040
white fling this can't be that hard he's

00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:48,960
also looking for weapons-grade naquadah

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:51,360
so if you have any of that if you are

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,400
previously an Arduino person looking to

00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,780
adventure into the pie and you're like I

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,390
got this Esther were full of arduino

00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,160
shields there's a not app there's a

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:02,520
piece of hardware for that this is

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,890
called the Alamo for your pie ha ha ha

00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,260
there are a couple of mutts cleverly

00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:09,870
named ones things like Arduino for your

00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,910
pie but the end result is the same it

00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,100
lies on top and then you add to our

00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:20,420
video field and that is what you decide

00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:20,420
to do oh this is a my favorite Roger

00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:38,680
stir it like coffee maker the next step

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,779
I feel they're missing is somehow the

00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,099
rabbit I'm going to pick up the clapping

00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:43,420
and bring it to me because i'm not sure

00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:46,900
what the point of starting it remotely

00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:53,680
by us i offered the bullet trebuchet for

00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:56,499
it but she was not interested people are

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,819
onto something here you know i'm going

00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:59,559
to finish I'm gonna finish my

00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:05,529
functioning TARDIS before it finishes

00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:08,019
Stargate this is a project that I

00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:09,339
entirely intended to bring and then my

00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:10,809
husband I drove separately and he left

00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,609
her house you can yell at him later but

00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,869
rendezvous Bay with Han because he

00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,930
actually built it back in the back

00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:20,470
corner but he's like movie what come on

00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:21,849
here but if you have neighbors or seen

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,499
online people with the super cool of

00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:25,239
Christmas lights displays that you know

00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:27,910
play Wizards of winter and then go all

00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:29,349
crazy keep your head four strands of

00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,819
lights on with this you just need a lot

00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:32,380
more relays if you would like to have an

00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:34,509
epic wizards in winter or the one that

00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,200
did what does the fox say with all the

00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:40,239
pumpkins going if you saw that video

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,200
there's also a project called pi FM that

00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,650
i don't think i have in the slides

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,499
anymore but pi FM is a project where you

00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:49,390
turn your pie into an FM radio and with

00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:53,309
some transmitter to be clear them trains

00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,309
that are sorry when i say it radio radio

00:45:53,910 --> 00:46:00,150
with a questionably legal 50 centimeter

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,339
piece of wire attached to the GPIO

00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,200
transmit at least far enough of the

00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:08,680
people drivin by your house to hear what

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,029
you're sending out and so playa to

00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,230
christmas lights you are the most

00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:13,230
annoying neighbor on the block

00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:22,969
do not do not wire this into your cell

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:25,239
phone tower please this is the best

00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:28,039
Valentine ever it is a life-size

00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:29,960
reasonably functioning are two it is

00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:31,940
bilingual in Japanese in English it

00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,670
records messages and placement back for

00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,579
you it walks talks dances I don't know

00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,049
it does everything and I think that it's

00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:40,430
the best film however because he made a

00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:46,099
first girlfriend and now she's his wife

00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:47,779
so I really are too was a success this

00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:51,529
is one of those more practical projects

00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:54,349
their goal is to result in an obviously

00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:57,950
unbanned autonomous a little vote to go

00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:59,509
across the ocean and collect see data my

00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:09,289
favorite part is they're waterproof

00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:14,059
housing but but real serious hackers

00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:18,109
don't don't even need Tupperware

00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:19,849
water yeah so to be fair that's not an

00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:21,410
untreated Raspberry Pi in a bucket of

00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:22,880
water with a terrible terrible cell

00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,450
phone camera video I apologize so many

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,890
times but rather this is a Raspberry Pi

00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,569
that's been coated with a paint called

00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,839
never wet that you can buy from home

00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:35,450
depot rust-oleum sells it and basically

00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:36,739
you paint this pi up with your never wet

00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,450
you put your two coats with a different

00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:40,309
kind of paint on it and then you can

00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,739
submerse it completely in water and it

00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:44,690
will run happily now on the website it

00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:46,430
says things like you know in the faq

00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:50,650
question one can i do this to

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,650
electronics and it says no it eyes

00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:57,160
it does tell you that it only lasts a

00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,080
certain unknown amount of time so we

00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,150
have got tested is how long it would

00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,680
take for this to no longer function and

00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,850
so if you would like to send your boat

00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,560
across the ocean you should probably

00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,630
stick at the top where I ran it for 20

00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,130
minutes with no ill effect but I've

00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,420
never built a project needed to last

00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,420
more than 20 minutes I know right

00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,950
cameras are SuperDuper handy and as Tom

00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,930
mentioned for a long time there was this

00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,910
little black bar on the pie that did

00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:24,100
absolutely nothing except take up space

00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,020
but then they decided to make an easy

00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:45,280
pick to camera to go into the little

00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:47,590
connector sorry she's just go as well

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,270
and this is a really great project for

00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,700
kids to start with because the scripts

00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:54,040
to make all of this happen are basically

00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:57,160
a line and you can control so many

00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:00,010
things this version is the pi noir no I

00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:04,900
are the infrared version and it comes

00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:06,340
with a little blue filter and so this is

00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,170
a project called in for Graham they're

00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,720
actually using not infra red button for

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,920
blue because the result is it tough and

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,930
lots of interesting things about the

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,030
photosynthesis happening in an area and

00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,829
so this is a picture of luggage so the

00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,359
same place take it with it

00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,789
with a regular camera and so they're

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,289
using it to survey sections of land to

00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:27,999
find out about the health of the region

00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:29,349
using the little pie cameras and this is

00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,309
another ravi project he's not going to

00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:31,599
waive any more this time they needed

00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:33,910
last time but the guy in the back corner

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,599
there this is his picture from low Earth

00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:42,039
orbit photography rigs in a super cool

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,390
housing called a styrofoam cooler part

00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,890
of which helps to keep within the FAA

00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,779
regulations but then the results as you

00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,549
get a cool pictures like this or you can

00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:50,229
send you know LEGO minifigs up there and

00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:52,479
take pictures of them hanging out wave

00:49:50,229 --> 00:49:53,739
higher than you ever get to fly stupid

00:49:52,479 --> 00:49:57,180
minifigs getting to fly up into space

00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:59,589
but the results are really awesome and

00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:02,769
we have lots more ideas we can tell you

00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:04,690
about pi projects all day but will shoot

00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:18,880
you have some resources and take your

00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:22,150
questions well I think Thea is not much

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,650
for mr. you're overclocking the pie to

00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,940
be frank when you're when you overclock

00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,380
any chip beyond what it's rated for

00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,930
you're going to get weird operations out

00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,150
of the GPU and the firmware is actually

00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:34,229
running across the GPU on the Raspberry

00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:36,489
Pi so you're you're heating up the

00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:37,719
temperature of the thing that is

00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:39,130
controlling the firmware which is

00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:41,109
writing out to the disk so it is

00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,839
entirely unsurprising that the SD card

00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:46,059
would then write garbage at random as a

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,279
result which is why you know I only

00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:50,019
overclocked in cases where I don't

00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:52,630
really plan on using that project for a

00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:54,670
long periods of time and there's a

00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,109
little bit of tolerance and in fact the

00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,059
most recent versions of the firmer I

00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:59,890
will overclock within the safe ranges

00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:01,359
automatically so really think hard

00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,680
before you overclock outside of the

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,549
dynamic ranging that it's doing by

00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,549
default question two

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,519
well so it's USB to port it's a low

00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,230
power USB to port so your performance

00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,829
isn't going to be that much better than

00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,180
it would be across the SD card it's

00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:27,410
minuscule II better I mean if you're

00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,670
doing micro benchmarks are going to see

00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,410
a slight performance improvement across

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,150
USB 2 but you're not going to get USB 3

00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,039
speeds you're not going to get anything

00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,180
like that honestly if you want the

00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:36,410
fastest throughput you're going to want

00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,789
to go over a network mount that's going

00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,349
to be your fastest throughput as opposed

00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:40,789
to going over USB so doing a network

00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:43,549
mount across a good connection because

00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:44,720
you've got the 100 megabit connection if

00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:45,920
you can factor eight that you're going

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,089
to get much better than you would get if

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:58,400
you were directly connecting a sort of

00:51:47,089 --> 00:52:00,710
storage no there are people who have

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,089
done some really elaborate hacks to

00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:04,190
enable pixie booting basically they've

00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:06,829
written a custom OS that does nothing

00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:08,480
but tell via the boots the colonel in a

00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:09,619
minimum state to tell it to listen to

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,630
pixie boot on something and so you

00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:13,759
didn't change reading off of that but if

00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,539
you're at that point just run off the SD

00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:16,539
card I mean come on

00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:30,700
yep I don't know that has dropped off my

00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,700
head go to easily excited organ has that

00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,430
follow your slide

00:52:44,930 --> 00:53:06,650
village any other questions that people

00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:08,970
who don't want shirts questions so no

00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,859
the the biggest problem with doing a

00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,710
real time operating on the pie is that

00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:15,420
it has no real time clock there is no

00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,220
RTC on the pie so you're not going to

00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,849
get real time operations now there are a

00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,890
lot of add-on devices to add RTC's and

00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:25,309
there's a lot of projects online and

00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:27,960
talk about how to add the RTC chip to

00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:29,849
the pie either in your existing circuit

00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,140
board to do something else a lot of the

00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:32,640
things like the ala mode and other

00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,940
devices that actually layer onto the

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,069
GPIO will add the RTC in so that you can

00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,780
get that RTC but if you're looking for

00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:41,250
pure real time operations you're going

00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,750
to want to go to a more dedicated

00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,369
embedded board that has that set up

00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,970
already pre-configured the pie is not a

00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:46,970
good fit for that

00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:01,400
um yeah and there's a lot of out on

00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:03,859
boards that do it exactly that that will

00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,680
they'll layer in they'll jump in to the

00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:08,329
pie across the GPIO pins they'll usually

00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,309
have a custom image that you run to take

00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:11,869
advantage of the extra features they'll

00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:13,640
usually bring in external power at a

00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:15,049
higher rate you'll see their boards that

00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,119
are out there for robotics use on the

00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:18,380
pie that ad relay switches and stepper

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,940
motor controls and things like that

00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,990
depending on the project you're looking

00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,549
for there's a lot of people that are

00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:24,589
selling custom out on boards that will

00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:27,500
extend the pie out to do additional

00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:29,240
things now if you're really really

00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,440
wanting to go in a specific area you

00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,000
might want to research whether a pie

00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,349
would be a better fit versus an Arduino

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,700
to set up for the project that you're

00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:36,680
looking at but there's a lot of people

00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,880
that are using it exactly there you're

00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,030
describing if they wanted to get a

00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,760
higher voltage of power into the mix or

00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:46,640
expand out to a set of additional gpio

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,380
pins add real time support to the board

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,780
add motor control all sorts of things

00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,880
like that well in different apply might

00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:55,430
not be the right board there are 400

all this stuff that we're doing with it

00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,099
anyway because it's cool but there are

your system metrics tell stories stories

00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:16,070
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,990

memory swap processes load and network

00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:44,390
usage click a specific system to access

00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:46,369
its individual dashboard then click and

00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:49,369
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:51,380
more detail comprehensive network data

including inbound and outbound traffic

00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:56,060
is available on the network tab and disk

00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:58,220
rights and free space on a disk stabbed

00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,410
while the process explorer displays

00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,930
usage statistics for individual

00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:05,119
processes the system info tab shows

00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:07,369
listening services active connections

00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,500
and available updates adding long view

00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:11,180
to a system is easy just click the

00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,340
button copy the one line installation

00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,770
command then run the command on your

00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,480
linux system to complete the process the

00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:19,670
agent will begin collecting data and

00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,530
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:24,080
start rolling

00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:26,450
use longview to gain visibility into

00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:30,160
your servers so when your website or app

00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:30,160
heats up it stays up

00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,820
