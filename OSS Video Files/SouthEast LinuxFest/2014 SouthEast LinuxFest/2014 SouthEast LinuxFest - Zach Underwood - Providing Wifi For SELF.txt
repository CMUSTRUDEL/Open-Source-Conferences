the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,250
the 2014 southeast linux fest in

org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,769
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,920
in 2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,150
possible alright well ladies and

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,460
gentlemen let me introduce Zach

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,210
Underwood he's got a whole bunch of

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,399
letters behind his name like rhce and

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:40,680
various others I don't see a plus though

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:43,129
no he's a sysadmin with global vision a

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,410
wireless isp he's here to talk about

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:50,340
setting up the wireless access here at

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,600
self well thank you for the intro before

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,559
I get started I do want to give one

00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:03,030
thinks both you'd stand up yeah stand up

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:07,439
bo bo Santos was my linux teacher while

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,180
I was at college and he's mentored me to

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,490
steer me towards this path so I just

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,049
wanted to give that shout out and and I

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,470
did not warn him so that was a bit of

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:22,020
surprise for him my background try to go

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,610
into my current company I was basically

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,590
the average sysadmin when it came to

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,590
wireless hey I'll go buy this linksys

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,140
router I'll plug it in and hey it kind

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,020
of works then I went for it for a

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,000
wireless isp where I do everything from

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,200
climb cell phone towers to install

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,790
antennas to program routers for bgp so

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,680
this is a little bit about my background

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:49,590
imn rhce for version 6 my company sets

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,780
up and maintains large-scale Wi-Fi

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,890
systems for cities the landmark or the

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,960
CBRE / Furman company

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,290
management company buildings so these

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,030
are high rises 20 30 stories where we

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,820
provide Wi-Fi throughout the building we

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,830
also do quite a few outdoor

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,720
installations with cities where we will

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,380
put up access points on Main streets and

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,330
then feed those acts points using

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,940
wireless technology so that we don't

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,560
have to run as many cables and if I am

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,920
talking too fast someone please say

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:29,800
something because I'll get that way they

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,190
we have done pickens south carolina we

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,830
also have put in bids to do Easley South

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,690
Carolina Liberty South Carolina and

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,310
Anderson County Anderson city the

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,380
question was what cities have we

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:46,900
provided Wi-Fi to and our Pickens

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:51,010
network can see about a thousand unique

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,230
users a week concurrently it's only

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,700
about a hundred but being at these

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,950
access point to mounted at street level

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,900
we get a lot of as people are driving

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,480
down Main Street their cell phones auto

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,700
connect whether they know it or not and

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,459
so we do have your eye we do have your

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:12,579
mac address a little Wi-Fi intro and

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:16,390
some misconceptions about Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:20,260
a two-way conversation it is not like FM

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,540
and AM radio it is not one way so that

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,880
means that your client the client device

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,790
has to be strong enough to talk back to

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,450
the access point the best analog I can

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,209
give would be if say I'm an access point

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,000
and one of y'all or a client I'm

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,280
standing up here with a PA system you're

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,269
back there whispering we cannot have a

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,239
two-way conversation doing that so when

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:49,660
you spec out antennas for a wireless

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,000
system you have to you cannot go oh this

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,470
has a huge antenna it's going to give me

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,150
great range

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,920
that's not going to doing any good if

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,500
your clients can talk back to the access

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:06,370
point signal versus noise this gets in

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,250
any of y'all hands good so y'all know

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,890
about signal vs. noise ratios for those

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,840
who are not hands signal is basically

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,630
the signal that it receives from the

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,880
access point or the client depending on

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,000
which direction you're going the noise

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,790
is how much other frequency in the area

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,750
is being used the best analog I can come

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,660
up with would be the equivalent of noise

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,680
would be like a car outside playing loud

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,920
music I I'm the signal there I have to

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,100
speak louder to overcome the car stereo

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,830
outside in order for y'all to hear me so

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,470
if you could lower the noise like turn

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,490
the car off the or closed in the door

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,590
then you can then the requirement for

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,020
the signal level goes down so the

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,810
quieter you can get the environment NORs

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:03,550
wise at RF wise the better the

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:07,600
performance a B and G or different

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,370
wireless standards I everything all of

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,440
that is considered legacy and if you're

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,150
still running an access point that is

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,930
one of those three standards please turn

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,860
it off it is a waste of spectrum spend

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,710
50 60 bucks and get a wireless n so for

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,880
the same amount of spectrum you can get

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,530
double triple the performance and then

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,060
we're up to what we have currently which

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:37,060
is Wireless N and wireless AC AC is

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,970
really new devices just started shipping

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,750
in the past year client devices that i

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,030
know of our high-end android phones like

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:51,060
the galaxy s

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:53,250
for and the nexus 5 macbook pros but i

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,810
don't think macbook the MacBook Airs

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,950
have it I think it's just the pros and

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:05,340
also saw a Samsung device here that had

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:06,900
wireless AC 2 wireless n is and the

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,270
majority of the devices that connect to

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,740
the network i would say looking at

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,900
statistics about ninety-eight percent of

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:21,180
those devices connect to the network or

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:24,090
wireless in ok 2.4 vs 5 gigahertz 2.4

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,940
has a lot more noise that noise can come

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,990
anywhere from microwaves to cell phones

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:35,550
to these wireless mics we really hope

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:37,680
this ain't 2.4 what one of the hardest

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,730
things that can be to troubleshoot a 2.4

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,560
network is you can get a call in from

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:47,640
users going hey starting at about eleven

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,500
o'clock Wi-Fi just sucks and then you

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,410
start investigating it you start getting

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,610
a spectrum analyzer and then you start

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:59,340
seeing spikes and the noise it's around

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:02,130
eleven thirty people go to lunch during

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,200
1130 microwaves people will return

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,140
certain microwaves when they are

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,380
activated produce the same frequency as

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,190
wireless 2.4 so that they can cause a

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,190
lot of interference

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:20,570
2.4 because its legacy has better

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,630
support among clients every wife every

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:27,620
wireless client is 2.4 not every

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,890
wireless client is 5 5 gigahertz is

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,590
better and most over all aspects with

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:36,410
one exception it's got more spectrum and

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:41,420
better speed and it's cleaner spectrum

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:44,840
because it's negative is its penetration

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,900
through materials is not as great as 2.4

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,540
so it takes a lot more access points to

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,180
cover five that can be a blessing and a

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,030
curse yes it costs more money but it

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,190
gets more access points so the more

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,110
access points the more bandwidth that

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:05,030
you can push because the more clients

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:09,010
can associate in 2.4 there's only three

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,990
overlapping channels it's 16 16 and 11

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:15,230
and that does leave a small buffer

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:19,250
between them and I can actually show you

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:23,210
what those look like and it's my

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:26,270
favorite program called insider and what

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,900
you essentially see here is the 16 and

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,190
11 channels and that you can see there's

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,660
a nice little buffer between eight and

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:40,280
nine and whoever is running that whoever

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:42,380
runs their access point biz ops mifi

00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,110
whoever runs their access points on on

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,820
non centered channels screws everyone

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,820
because what happened

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,139
what happens see what happens when I

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,480
highlighted this and it turned to all of

00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:06,959
these red what is happening by this one

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,930
guy my the verizon my files are

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,910
notorious for doing this what happens is

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:17,550
that that channels now squashing and

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,220
causing problems on two of my channels

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,319
where if it just moved over one more

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,660
channel 21 it's only going to be

00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:27,449
interfering on one channel which I can

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,290
tolerate one channel but screwing with

00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:33,990
two that's bad and if you recognize if

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,730
you see your SSID on here and because

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,399
you're running a hotspot please turn it

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:45,569
off do the entire conference some good

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:47,600
don't be don't be selfish any questions

00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:49,660
so far

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,660
I

00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm biz op and

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,420
yeah more than likely what I suspect is

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,280
actually what I'm just about to talk

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:17,790
about is the difference between channel

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:23,250
sizes okay so I'll skip the below 20 vs

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:27,750
40 megahertz most devices and 2.4 can

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,040
only connect on 20 megahertz so that

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,600
means that use 20 megahertz of spectrum

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:37,860
to speak back to the AP and then there's

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,130
40 megahertz the same thing the more

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:45,500
megahertz the more theoretical bandwidth

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:49,550
you can shove in that pipe newer devices

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,680
some of them do support 40 megahertz on

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,380
2.4 gigahertz however when you use a 40

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,400
megahertz channel your channel size is

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:02,300
double that of the original spec so

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,650
instead of taking instead of overlap it

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,270
when you use 40 megahertz channels

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,240
there's only two non-overlapping

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:13,920
channels I think there I think it's like

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:17,460
three and nine so you lose number

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:22,240
channels but you can gain per formats

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:25,660
the next is the 5 gigahertz and DFS DFS

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,020
if you do not abide by this rule you can

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:32,220
end up in serious trouble with the FCC

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:35,380
DFS is a mechanism for radar detection

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,420
the Doppler radar running at the

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,480
charlotte airport here is using 5

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,440
gigahertz to detect with known as wind

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,900
shear basically turbulence at low level

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,600
near the ground and this this Doppler

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,120
radar can map that interference to give

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,500
pilot two heads up of when they're

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,590
landing if you run your equipment

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,990
illegally meaning you hack the firmware

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,180
you use non-standard firmware and you

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,210
run it illegally you can interfere with

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,700
this radar and FCC is very sensitive

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,700
about this radar there was a whisk down

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,040
in Florida that ran their radios

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,480
illegally they got a

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,520
hundred-thousand-dollar fine because

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,400
they were running their equipment

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,520
illegally and they and they nearly

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,250
called an aircraft to crash because the

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,220
pilot could not get accurate data for

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,540
their wind shear so you have to know

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,120
where if you're going to be running with

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,660
5 gigahertz outdoors you have to know

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,210
where these radars are listed Charlotte

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,970
is the closest one that's short on the

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:47,460
land to the ones I know and anything

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,170
within 70 miles can be affected by this

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,530
basically what happens is if the radio

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,870
detects if the if the radio to Texas

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,590
radar it shuts down for 10 minutes and

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,990
listens if it detects it again

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,000
it has one or two options shut down

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,480
until until you physically reboot the

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,720
device or pick a new frequency from a

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,730
pre-populated list the you a PS that we

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,380
use for this conference are all made by

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,900
ubiquity the the product line is called

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,720
unify and this particular product is

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:30,120
unify AC and I can actually show you one

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:33,330
right here this is a this is the

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,850
production AC we actually run five of

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:40,500
these for the three ballrooms they have

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:47,220
to they have two gigabit ethernet

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:49,640
adapters on them they run in 2.4 they

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,140
run in two point four and five gigahertz

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:58,550
they are p 0 e compliant afm

00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:00,570
specifically and they cost 300 bucks now

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,330
you can think that's kind of expensive

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:08,340
we talked about an AP of this caliper

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:12,750
that is not a cisco wireless AC AP you

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:17,280
could be looking at 1500 minimum now we

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:20,730
get to the uap this is this is their

00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,360
first entry into the client radio the

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,360
indoor radio

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:36,470
uap is unified access point unify is the

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:39,620
brand name for ubiquity this is 2.4

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:43,640
gigahertz only and it retails for 70

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,790
bucks but all of ubiquitous radios are

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,070
POA only power over ethernet so there is

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,370
no wall there's no wall adapter what it

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,110
is is apoe injector which then you run

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,810
ethernet to the access point so it's one

00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,320
cable you run to the access point this

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:04,590
happens to use a proprietary Ethernet a

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,810
proprietary a power injector

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,420
the software this is the software that

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,490
you have to use to manage the access

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,270
points the access points do not have a

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,210
web interface too but they do have ssh

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:21,940
they run busybox so you can't ssh into

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,400
them but your options are severely

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,030
limited if you do that to try to

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,000
configure the access point using ssh it

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,970
is free it is not open source it is

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,890
java-based don't don't hold that against

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:42,820
me and it is it is own it is needed to

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:45,100
configure control statistics and captive

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,550
portal all you don't know what captive

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,550
portal is

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,570
yes exactly hey I'll repeat that captive

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,790
portal is when you connect to the public

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,560
network and you see that a terms and

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,000
conditions page but basically I says I

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,340
have full rights to kick you off the

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
network and there's a lot will connect

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,490
button at the bottom and until you hit

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,820
that connect button you do you cannot

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,380
pass any traffic pass the access point

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,450
soon as you hit that connect button then

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,170
you are fully on the network that is

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,170
captive portal

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,800
yes by default it ships with a pre

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,500
pretty much a generic captive portal all

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,459
the captive portal really is is about

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,649
six lines of post and get requests so

00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:52,110
you can copy those and put them on any

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:57,209
HTML page that you won't always happens

00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:00,740
to use HTML and CSS and actually it i'm

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,740
going to show you the software

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,530
can everyone see that or do I need to

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,530
zoom in

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:13,140
all right I'm it's the

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:17,340
let's go much more navigate so this is

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,260
the a software itself here's a little

00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,210
statistics which it shows up better on

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,580
when you actually have proper real

00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:27,140
estate so this basically just shows a

00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:32,100
nice pretty grass for distribution of

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:34,830
clients as far as which a PSR on how

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:39,110
many clients how much traffic load and

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:41,370
those also wet SSID who connected on

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,310
this is just a summary of all the access

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:49,410
points how many clients are connected

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:52,050
what's their names over here again it's

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,120
summary of their config so you can see

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,810
the power levels that I'm running what

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:02,130
frequency they're running what network

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:06,180
and even the performance I don't know

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,860
what the colors mean so I don't know so

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,080
you can see the distribution of clients

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,640
and actually that top one I'm really

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,270
surprised of how many 5 gigahertz that

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,320
is and then you can also see all the

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:22,200
users and bonus if you can spot your own

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,660
post name here's some of the users that

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,520
are connected from here you can see the

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:32,400
signal strength how much data they've

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:34,650
transmitted wireless-ac the purple means

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,970
5 gigahertz and then the number inside

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:42,060
of the frequency the blue is 2.4 and

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:46,650
then also with the guest network in

00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:50,190
particular you can block so if there's a

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,840
if one of you users is is playing some

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,310
funny business on the network you can

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,870
block them from the network and that

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,890
actually blocks it at the access point

00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,890
level yes

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,320
it does it by MAC address and yes there

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:08,750
are ways to get around that but your

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:11,200
average user does not know that yes I do

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,200
not know

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,580
question them back

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,929
also one of the main things I like about

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:31,679
this is its central control I can make

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:35,370
all my settings done right here so i can

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,419
define all my networks including the

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:46,399
veal am the type of network the type of

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:49,769
security I can also do speed limiting by

00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:52,950
client device so these are done in it's

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:56,039
called groups user groups which the user

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,139
groups are based on which SSID that

00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,470
they're connected to so you can see that

00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:04,080
the speeds that I have set as the

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,760
maximum speeds for up and down are for

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,559
the different networks and this is done

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,559
again on the AP level

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,710
you can do for SS IDs and they can all

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:21,540
be they can be individually veal and or

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,030
you can just leave them all on the

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:28,190
native VLAN which there's not a whole is

00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,190
not a huge use case for doing that

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,510
not that I know of one thing that you

00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:45,230
will notice about the ubiquity stuff is

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,120
it's not as not its high-end as you

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,240
would find on like a cisco wireless

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,029
controller it's free and it's cheap

00:20:50,240 --> 00:21:01,789
hardware so kind of get what you pay for

00:20:53,029 --> 00:21:04,279
but it's for the money it's good for you

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:07,429
for your question earlier how do you

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:10,610
actually get an access point to join the

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:14,240
controller there are two options that I

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,909
use there is the host name so when the

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,700
access point boots up on the network it

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:22,700
goes out asks to dhcp server for an

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,600
address gets it back and then does look

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:31,159
up it looks for unify dot the domain get

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:34,100
from dhcp so if like an arg in this case

00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:37,580
we have self dot local so our unify

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:42,620
server is unify that self dot local so

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:45,049
these ApS out of the box default I plug

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,179
them in and they immediately connect

00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,700
with the server this also works if they

00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:51,980
get defaulted somehow they automatically

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,210
connect back to the server once they are

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:59,000
at the server level it they registered

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:02,530
as pending and then you go in there and

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,350
you hit adopt once it adopts the

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,750
it sends a command back to the access

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:11,740
point and gives it basically the configs

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,750
to use and tells it to reboot the other

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:20,320
option is if you can't control the DNS

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:22,300
you can do da DHCP option 43 I don't

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,780
know exactly what that option is I see a

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:30,100
lot of Cisco devices using it too so it

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,260
the BIC what do you pick what he does

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,410
make some routers inside the router

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,750
interface it's got a little chat box we

00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,140
check it and then type in the IP of your

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:43,860
unify server so does that answer your

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,860
question about the

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:58,610
no it looks for unified dot the domain

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,610
it that from dhcp so

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,480
to back to where

00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,870
yes yep and that just is a simple a

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,870
record

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:21,770
it is TCP what it actually does is I

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:24,860
believe it does a modified ssh protocol

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:26,630
to for the client from the AP to speak

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,120
back to the control and vice versa and

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,250
it will establish a persistent

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,660
connection to the server so that it can

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:38,600
get away with net all the this does work

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,090
over the internet and we have got about

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,190
a dozen of our a dozen sites that

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:48,110
connect back to our controller over the

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:52,970
wider public internet how to get better

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:54,860
performance in Wi-Fi it's channel plan

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,050
that's that's one of the biggest ones

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,360
and this where is going to introduce

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:04,730
insider insider is a great way it's it's

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,100
windows and they also make an android

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,210
client the android clients actually

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,490
pretty good there is similar tools for

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,890
linux kismet is the one that comes to my

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,260
mind though i'm not as well versed in

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:22,600
those

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:26,860
so this basically you can sort by signal

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:29,620
level so here you can see that if i was

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:32,170
going to set up an AP located where my

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,240
laptop is i would not want to use

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,000
channel 11 and i would not want to use

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,490
channel 1 because by signal level that

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,830
is the highest channels in use right

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:46,630
here so I would fire it up on six when

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,590
you get to the five gigahertz you have a

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:52,990
lot more freedom and so channel planning

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,560
is not as important but it still is

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,560
important

00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:04,549
the biggest mistake people make and a

00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:07,340
multi access point environment is not

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:09,229
adjusting the transmit power this is

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,820
probably one of the most critical things

00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:15,979
you can do basically what it is is your

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,999
clients can hear too many access points

00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:22,099
and hear them too strongly what once you

00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:25,940
do that once you decrease the power

00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:28,909
levels they hear it's less noise less

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,649
interference and the clients connect

00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:35,089
access points in a more predictable

00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:37,279
manner we happen to run all of our at

00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:40,849
this event we're running all the access

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:44,059
points on the 2.4 we log we run them in

00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:46,849
low-power mode and then we run the 5

00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:49,729
gigahertz in a mix of medium and high

00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:53,599
the reason is to do the difference is

00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:56,869
because the range the signal the signal

00:25:53,599 --> 00:26:02,229
level at range is less on 5 gigahertz

00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:06,609
than 2.4 so clients as dumb as they are

00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:06,609
McClurkin device clients not people

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:14,929
device clients device clients will

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:19,239
connect to the strongest signal whether

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:22,759
it's on 2.4 or not so you can have a

00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:25,700
have a laptop on 5 gigahertz it's

00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,070
running great and then there's this 2.4

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,950
access point like it's fired up your

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:34,039
client will ditch the nice performing 5

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,049
gigahertz to go over to the 2.4 because

00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,619
it's a few DB

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:40,960
a better signal even though the 2.4

00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:42,129
frequency can be trashed it doesn't

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,149
matter it just looks at the signal

00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:48,190
strength another thing we thought I hate

00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:51,399
device clients and how stupid they are

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:55,720
is understanding an understanding

00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:59,559
minimum RSSI RSSI is essentially the

00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,409
ratio between signal and noise so what

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,080
that means is when the client connects

00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:07,629
to the access point the access point is

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,239
saying you must have a certain signal

00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:13,989
level if you want to continue talking to

00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:15,669
me this helps in a highly mobile

00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:19,720
environment like we are in right now

00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:21,759
where people get up and move clients are

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,700
incredibly sticky to the access point

00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,399
they connect to they will stay connected

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,200
to that access point you could walk by

00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:31,239
three other access points and it'll

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,519
still try to maintain connection to that

00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:35,889
original access point that's where

00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,559
minimum RSSI comes in because as a

00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:40,539
signal level gets lower as the device

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,820
walks to the other end of the room at

00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:45,210
some point the access point will kick

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:48,249
you off but get out get out it could go

00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,679
what that does is that forces the client

00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:52,869
to reestablish connection when it

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,820
reestablishes the connection it connects

00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,490
to the strongest signal level at that

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,860
time

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:03,809
in most applications you can't notice

00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:08,130
this however SSH tunnels and void do not

00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:10,980
tolerate this disconnect streaming video

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:13,970
streaming music web browsing email all

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,290
do just fine so for your average user

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,860
they probably will not notice it

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,440
unfortunately you all have noticed that

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,690
here at this event as you roam around

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,950
because some of for some reason but

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:33,000
genetic speaks like SSH tunnels the next

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:35,510
is to prefer this works best in a

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,730
corporate environment where the IT

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:42,179
specimen dates certain policies of the

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,740
network and that is preferring five

00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:47,040
gigahertz i'm going to show you an

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:50,790
example of this is with a wireless this

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,400
is in of course windows 7 using an intel

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,860
wireless AC adapter by the way this AC

00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,470
adapter is is thirty-five dollars on

00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:03,179
amazon and newegg so if you want AC in

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:08,309
your laptop unless you use the fruit if

00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:09,870
you use a real computer if you use a

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,900
real computer which you can actually

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:16,050
change hardware parts on then you can

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,150
pick up a $35 wireless card and swap it

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,830
out and have AC performance and it's

00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:23,400
starting to become the gold standard for

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:25,020
after aftermarket wireless cards so i

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,260
just wanted to show you the property and

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,320
windows

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,390
and this is unfortunately it is specific

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,310
to the driver and anyone that is the

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:41,310
model of the wireless adapter it's Intel

00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:41,310
7260 and it retails for 35 bucks yes

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:48,640
do not know but I I suspect it is

00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:52,380
because everything I've read is Intel's

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,380
wireless drivers are among the best

00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:02,020
depends my particular laptop shipped

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,270
with a two point four and five radio

00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,450
already inside it so the antenna was

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,559
already designed for that application

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,929
however I have a co-worker that I

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,100
swapped out his his have two point four

00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:18,789
only and the five is not as good as mine

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:25,980
but it is still pretty darn good so that

00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:25,980
is really a trial and error basis yes

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,960
beautiful that is amazing and this is

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,530
why I like Intel network adapters I do

00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,890
not like Broadcom or realtek i use intel

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:48,370
drivers whenever I can or until adapters

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:51,430
so here is where it is quite literally

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:54,090
as easy as a drop down menu lenox I do

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,090
not know

00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,800
yes this particular adapter does support

00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,930
widi which is Intel's wireless display

00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,490
technology and it's also gives you a

00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:11,170
Bluetooth 4.0 for 35 bucks i really wish

00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:15,460
i could give away a referral code for

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:17,800
amazon also while I'm in here roaming

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,300
aggression this is another feature that

00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,180
if you're in a corporate environment and

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,090
your users are highly mobile could come

00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,670
in huge advantage basically this changes

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:30,910
the level of stickiness and access point

00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:33,760
has or a stickiness the client has to an

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:37,750
access point so this can manipulate how

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,880
long it stays connected and i set mine

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,980
the highest because i won't mind to

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,420
reestablish connection as fast as

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,420
possible to the stronger signal

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,429
observe Ian observe ian is the network

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,570
monitoring system that I live and die by

00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:01,720
at my work we monitor every device every

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:04,020
Network device every cpe that we deploy

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,770
at a customer's home we are monitoring

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,890
using SNMP so observe ian is an SNMP it

00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:16,450
used the freemium model the paid version

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,960
is a hundred euros a year this this

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:23,669
software it will how many of y'all use

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,799
nog use how many of y'all hate nagios

00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:29,559
check out observe ian it makes it super

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,080
simple to set up literally all you do to

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:37,240
add a device to observe ian is type in

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:41,350
its host name and then it then you may

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,200
or may not have to specify a community

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:46,450
for SNMP it does allow you to set up a

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,700
default so for my company we use the

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:52,240
same community on every device so I just

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,429
simply put in the default that we use it

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,070
is they do release an open-source

00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:59,860
version every six months that is is

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:02,980
basically a tarball of the production

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:07,900
code at that moment so that so the last

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:13,120
release was I think in April it is a PHP

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:15,280
my sequel rrd and crontab based network

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,340
monitoring it's not a daemon you

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,659
basically put in a cron job that refers

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:24,549
back to a PHP code so it's from it's

00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:27,760
pretty easy to install as long as you

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:29,350
follow the instructions to a tee if you

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,809
do not follow the instructions to a tee

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,630
and you mess up and then you go into the

00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,179
mailing list Adam the founder of the

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,400
project well first question did you

00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:40,500
follow the instructions to it

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,550
through answers anything other than yes

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,470
you'll save reinstall so he's incredibly

00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:50,070
strict because I think he just got tired

00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:54,680
of dealing with it follows that rtfm

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:59,900
policy it uses svn to do updates and

00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:04,380
they release code often almost every day

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:07,800
I once had a bug I reported it to him I

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,419
get an email back going update within 20

00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,270
minutes of me reporting the bug I

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:18,270
updated and it was fixed and I was going

00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:19,950
to give a quick little show of it one of

00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:25,230
the things that I use observing for in

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:28,290
my network is a network log and so we

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:30,929
can see when network interfaces come up

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,770
and come down switch between 100

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:38,250
megahertz or 100 meg and a gig we can

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:41,520
see when devices reboot we can see when

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:44,220
a device goes down how it calculates the

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,600
reboot is if the up timer or the uptime

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:52,130
timer in SNMP if that gets reset then it

00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,130
considers a device rebooted

00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:59,029
one of the i'm going to have to shrink

00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,029
the screen

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:08,790
one of the things that I use a lot is

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,890
basically sorting the ports so this is

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,350
how I keep this sits on my network

00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,240
operations desk and this is how I

00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:17,580
monitor traffic so this this particular

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,000
view right here shows network

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:24,180
utilization or network traffic by volume

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,010
of every port in the network so after

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,250
watching this for about a week you can

00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:31,290
figure out trends this also can help so

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,850
when you're back when your internet

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,480
connection gets flooded you could see

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:40,560
this in this it also has support for

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,760
applications so here is basically a

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,600
number of hits this is believe this is

00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,720
hit this is the daemon so this right

00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,060
here is running for Apache so you can

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,270
see what percent of the time was spent

00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,510
writing reading dns lookups caching and

00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:04,680
this is all pulled through a plug-in or

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:07,579
a script on the Apache server

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,579
questions

00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,840
how am i doing on time

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,220
alright yes

00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:29,870
no I I think squid is useless nowadays

00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:34,730
because of SSL and especially since

00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:37,340
Google Facebook all the big name the big

00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,160
name websites are going to SSL any SSL

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,700
everywhere and all the time basically

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,770
defeats the point of squid eyes I ran a

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,230
squid server about two years ago and

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:52,520
always saying about a ten percent hit

00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:55,430
rate which is not worth the effort the

00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,620
particular router the particular router

00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:03,050
that I use for this event is actually a

00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:05,710
ubiquity router which is based on beata

00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:11,270
how many of y'all heard of vienna before

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:13,130
good those who have it it is a it is a

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:17,210
router OS that is written on top of

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:20,180
Debian and by otter basically stripped

00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,650
away the Debian tab completion and uses

00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:27,560
his own so when you hit tab it shows the

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,630
biotic commands and there was a little

00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,770
controversy with Vienna it was bought by

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:36,440
brocade and brocade made it commercial

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:40,720
before they did that there was a project

00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:44,720
called V y OS that forked the vyatta and

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,230
ubiquity has forked that and they are

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,930
working to get the v y OS is working

00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:54,700
with ubiquity about making sure that

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,700
they stay compatible with each other

00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:06,160
so this is basically a summary of the

00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:11,170
numbers that are used for this event we

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,180
have five of the 2.4 access points we

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,660
have five to the AC access points which

00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:19,420
are all the ACS are in the ballrooms we

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,400
got three servers these are 31 new

00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,940
servers that happen to be sitting on the

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,329
shelf not doing anything at work to HP

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,559
switches which are 48 ports each I know

00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:32,440
completely overkill but they were

00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,619
sitting on the show and ubiquity edge

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:39,849
router again overkill this is an eight

00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:41,319
port router with two gigs around again

00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:43,089
it was sitting on the shelf it's a cold

00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,309
spell it's a cold spare for one of our

00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:46,630
production router so after this event

00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:51,430
it's going to get default and put back

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:53,910
in the box all in total between the

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,289
network gear and the internet connection

00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:00,099
we came at less than three thousand

00:38:56,289 --> 00:39:01,809
dollars and gear there was no way you'd

00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:06,039
be able to do this event with cisco gear

00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:07,539
for less than 10 grand and any of those

00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:10,599
that have dealt with internet

00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:14,890
connections before i got to give props

00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:17,529
to the time warner guy he told me he'd

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:20,619
be here be be at the a at the hotel

00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:23,920
between one and five pm on onto us last

00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:26,199
tuesday i rolled up at 115 and he was

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,329
wrapping up he said here's your IDs i

00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:33,569
connected they worked immediately so

00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,569
there are some good cable installers

00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:40,990
that he should have now temporary

00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,450
internet connections this is dirty

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,280
little secret in the ISP industry

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,550
temporary internet connections are

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,270
hugely profitable for the company we

00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:56,560
paid six hundred dollars for for a five

00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:00,280
or a 50 by five cable connection for

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,470
seven days yeah that we paid more than a

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,180
year's worth for that connection tap

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:10,180
that the privilege of having it for

00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:12,609
seven days now it after we get through

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,290
the questions if if you want to I can go

00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,690
over about some of the stuff my company

00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:22,240
is doing in the leftover time with

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:24,250
long-range outdoor wireless so I I will

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,480
open it up to questions about this about

00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,480
the topic at hand yes

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,900
the way we did it for this event is we

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,750
immediately turned everything below and

00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,270
then test it and unfortunately we can't

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,480
we could not push the power levels even

00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:47,610
lower than we need it to if you're doing

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,280
it outside of this event and basically

00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:53,160
what you go to is you go in between two

00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,140
access points and you sit down and you

00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,780
look at insider and if the signal is is

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:03,900
below 50 so this works was a little

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:08,370
counterproductive in signal level neg 50

00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:11,430
it is worse than neg 40 so if you have

00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:15,030
an egg 50 signal that's great if you see

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:18,870
to mid 50s that's bad that means there's

00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,820
too much signal so you'll turn down the

00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:23,460
access points a little bit to try two

00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,410
more equal it out so you'd want

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,240
something like an egg sit in that

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,380
scenario with between two access points

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,380
like a negative 60

00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,720
as close as you can now there are some

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,150
things that will influence so if you

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,640
just do it by measurement and then try

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,430
to look at signal strength wireless is

00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,770
very finicky because of it can bounce

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,790
off stuff it can reflect it can be

00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:54,830
blocked by a tree so just because you

00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,780
measure just because the number of feet

00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:00,340
you are in the middle doesn't mean

00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,340
you're in the middle of the signal yes

00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:20,450
it's all it's all oh the question was is

00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,750
what is it the basically sum it up is

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:26,650
what is an acceptable signal level it's

00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:29,990
all relative it's relative to the noise

00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:33,950
the more noise you have the more signal

00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:37,220
level you need to get about three bars

00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:39,650
of signal and windows you need about 20

00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,510
DB separation which when you've signal

00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:46,730
and your noise so when you're in your

00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:50,000
example as long as your noise was so

00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,100
here's asking about is 60 okay as long

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,610
as you're 8 as long as your noise is

00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:58,790
better than 80 so maybe it's in the 90s

00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:01,250
then yes 60 will work 70 would work if

00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:03,670
you're sick if your noise is in the

00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,670
nineties

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,710
yes

00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:12,740
yes next question

00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:16,550
alright so my company does a lot of

00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:19,880
outdoor wireless we have some incredibly

00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:23,720
long wireless links our longest link is

00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,090
60 miles and it runs between a mountain

00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,790
top and a building and South Carolina

00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,890
it's running on five gigahertz so it's

00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,770
unlicensed so we don't pay the FCC

00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:38,390
anything and it can it can deliver about

00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:40,580
50 megs symmetric the radios between the

00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,010
radios and the dishes we're looking at

00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:47,390
less than a gram and the equipment to

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:49,190
make this link work now getting access

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,880
to that towers the other is another

00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:55,520
story big cell phone companies and tower

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,610
owners like american tower they own like

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:03,230
18,000 19,000 towers in here and south

00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:04,910
end the u.s. they can charge if it's at

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,300
the towers in an urban area like a

00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:10,610
downtown city even just like this area

00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,230
of charlotte I cell phone come or cell

00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,710
phone company or tower owner could want

00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:17,920
as much as two thousand dollars a month

00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:21,590
for three foot section of that tower

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:26,480
yeah it's it can get very expensive so

00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:28,850
our secret is we trade the tower access

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,380
so maybe the tower owners a radio

00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,360
station we'll go ahead will give you

00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,060
internet if you let us have access to

00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,490
your tower the other is work with city

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,640
governments city government's own towers

00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:43,910
and so this is what we do with the city

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,530
of pickings the Pickens they because

00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,020
their government they went to the

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,240
Forestry Service which to own a tower on

00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,640
a mountain and because we're doing this

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,760
project for the city we now have access

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,039
to this forestry service tower that if

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,269
we were not working with

00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,799
we would have never had access to

00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:01,269
because they don't give it they don't

00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:04,660
let access to commercial companies

00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:05,859
unless you work with the city if you

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:09,849
give me a second i'm actually going to

00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:11,769
log in through the VPN to the management

00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:14,039
system that i use for our outdoor

00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:14,039
wireless

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,960
it if none we all have run open VPN

00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:25,420
access server it is incredibly stupid to

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,550
mess it up it comes as a prepackaged

00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,130
virtual machine you plop out on your

00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,050
server and you boot it up and you follow

00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,240
the weazy we get you follow you follow

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,950
the weazy editor and it's a

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,770
self-contained virtual machine that does

00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:42,330
VPN we happen to have are tied into

00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:45,010
active directory budget when you get it

00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:49,359
as a free model you get two concurrent

00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:52,660
users it is five dollars a user a year

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,890
for VPN I if you go above to that is

00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,619
incredibly cheap when you start looking

00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,750
at the commercially supported VPN models

00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:01,270
some of the big ones like cisco and

00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:06,119
juniper dan can charge like five or ten

00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:06,119
dollars a month purge / concurrent users

00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,380
alright so this is air control this is

00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,410
another ubiquity software and this is a

00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:24,060
little map of our network and this is

00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:26,040
just a small section of it we run the

00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,800
back if you look at the number of users

00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,080
most of our users of residential users a

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,320
lot of our users can't get anything more

00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:39,210
than BSA and I've got dsl it's a 1 point

00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:42,090
1 point 1 point 5 Meg dsl that's 1.5

00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:45,210
minutes down we can come in there for

00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:48,420
cheaper than dsl and offer 3 by 3 so

00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:50,850
symmetric bandwidth with a static IP for

00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,040
less than they're paying with dsl now

00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,480
we're not price competitive with with

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,060
the cable companies because it's

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,730
impossible to be but we were almost

00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:03,540
always price competitive with the DSL

00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:05,460
providers in this particular network we

00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:10,080
have a hundred and thirty-eight radios

00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:13,740
that we monitor and this this basically

00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,300
shows this basically shows the location

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,030
all the coordinates for these are

00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,890
pre-programmed unfortunately they do not

00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,830
have a GPS built n because that cost

00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:27,960
more money to client radios themselves

00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:30,390
call $69 yes what sort of the latency to

00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,890
your normal client see from you know

00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,680
like these people out in rural areas

00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:38,289
going from dsl to

00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:41,829
five gig system you five gigahertz

00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:45,279
system a lot of case are latency to

00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:47,589
Google's public dns server 888 is better

00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,390
than the cable company I have K bought

00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:53,049
my house because I don't live within our

00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,849
coverage area my average ping latency to

00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:57,609
Google's DNS server is about 30

00:47:54,849 --> 00:48:00,369
milliseconds from one of our wireless

00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:02,980
customers we can expect about about five

00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:05,619
to eight milliseconds to Google's DNS

00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:09,269
servers wireless ads between one and

00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:12,450
three milliseconds to the link that

00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:12,450
answer your question

00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:22,349
so this is another view that basically

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,150
shows the diagram of so the other one

00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,970
was the physical layout this is the

00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:28,740
logical and all of this is automatically

00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:32,760
recalculated every time we add a new

00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:34,980
radio yes it is proprietary it only

00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:41,130
works with their at radios but it works

00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:43,950
good so the different colors red means

00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,680
that link is down Blue means it's a good

00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:49,619
signal strength and the green means a

00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:54,260
decent signal strength and if you've

00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,260
come up here the orange like you see

00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,990
see how this one is orange that means

00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,790
the signal is marginal unfortunately in

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,510
the outdoor environment 5 gigahertz is

00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:09,970
affected by trees some of our clients

00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:13,290
are so desperate to get internet because

00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:16,140
their only option is 1.5 Meg dsl

00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:18,490
hughesnet with data caps in late and

00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,030
ping Layton sees at five to six hundred

00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:23,740
milliseconds or dialogue so we had one

00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,960
client that we went out to their house

00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,420
and they had a row of Leyland cypress

00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:32,170
pine trees planted at the edge of their

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:34,570
property between our mountain and the

00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,000
mountain that were on and their home we

00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,740
said come back when those trees are gone

00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,530
or we'll come back when the trees are

00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,440
gone a week later we got a call we went

00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:50,140
out and they had cut a 40-foot swap of

00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:52,119
trees to get our service and and let me

00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,890
tell you that customers with a lawyer

00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,890
customer now for five years

00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:04,660
we mount all of our all of our equipment

00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:07,360
outdoors on the on the exterior of the

00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:11,610
house as high on the house as we can get

00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:19,750
them we do on chimneys on gutters on

00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:23,530
edges of roofs yeah yeah maa they were

00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:26,770
mature that there were mature trees the

00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:28,720
other is the thing because we're a small

00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,430
company we have flexibility we have

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,920
several of our customers that their

00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:36,490
house is it there's a tree in the way

00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,830
between the mountain and the their house

00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:41,260
and they don't want to cut the tree what

00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:43,720
they do is they put a post out in their

00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,060
yard which could be 200 feet away from

00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,190
the house and that particular spot of

00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,590
the yard has great coverage so will God

00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:52,600
mount the antenna and run the cable back

00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:55,600
to the house now we leave it up to the

00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,700
customer to bury the cable that's part

00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,560
because we don't we don't have equipment

00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,110
to do that and that's part of the

00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,210
agreement up front but we'll happily

00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,840
install the antenna wherever where the

00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,840
client won't fit

00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:14,950
ethernet so the customer would simply it

00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,550
comes out of the POV adapter so it is

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,869
ethernet from the radio to the boe

00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:21,369
adapter and then for the peoria doctor

00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:24,820
is just a simple patch cord to their

00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:27,369
router at which point they'll get a dhcp

00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:32,550
address from our router which is running

00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:32,550
a static IP 10 100

00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:42,340
no this there are there are other

00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,170
companies that do this I don't know

00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,270
about the Virginia area there's a couple

00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,510
websites that i'll give you my business

00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,510
card

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,020
okay okay so you've talked to someone in

00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,730
the what's one thing very neat unique

00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,220
about Western North Carolina like

00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:06,310
Asheville area is there's like twenty

00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:08,050
wisps running wireless ISPs running in

00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:10,450
Nashville air asheville and Western

00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:13,600
North Carolina where we are we're

00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:15,280
fortunate that we're the only ones so we

00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,900
get almost exclusive use of the

00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,780
frequency so fun is it from this

00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,850
interface yes we named our customer we

00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,880
named our ap's after the customers names

00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:32,080
so please don't do anything they get it

00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:36,550
to them let's see so one thing from here

00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,530
is see if it's going to work is with the

00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:42,070
click of a button I can go straight into

00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:46,720
the clients radio and yes this is fire

00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:49,170
water and see this is the interface for

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,210
the client that for the backhoe radio

00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:55,540
the client cannot connect to this radio

00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:59,619
this is this is exclusive blue we have

00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:03,010
exclusive control of this radio so you

00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:05,530
can see that you know from here you can

00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:07,570
see the signal strength the frequencies

00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:10,359
the status so one of the biggest

00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:13,090
complaints is we get a customer calls in

00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:16,210
well hey my internet is not working we

00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:18,850
come down to this box right here which

00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:22,090
basically says the land status and we'll

00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:24,580
find it it's an unplugged what they did

00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:27,280
is they unplugged their router from our

00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:30,070
modem and so we plug it back in and

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,820
we'll see it turn around if we see it

00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:37,330
goes to 100 full one thing that we do is

00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:39,609
we run our radios or Sims router mode so

00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:43,300
they actually have a static IP on on the

00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:46,480
radio itself and then we do not to get

00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:48,910
around the double map problem which

00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,230
breaks Xbox 360

00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:56,980
is we won dmz so we we set up a dhcp

00:53:53,230 --> 00:54:02,530
lease with one address in this case 1

00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:04,480
i'm 216 852 we then set up the DMZ to

00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:07,960
point to that address what that does is

00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,840
is that enables upnp from the clients

00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,330
from the clients devices like an Xbox to

00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,550
speak to the clients radio to open up a

00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:18,190
port and that it's like they're on the

00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:24,070
internet with a public IP but when

00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:26,140
really they're not and they show you

00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:30,450
some I don't like make sure that some

00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,450
pictures of these actually

00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:49,560
so this is actually some of our installs

00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:53,400
this is actually one we did at an

00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:56,599
airport that is our radio installed

00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,840
using a satellite mounting on a

00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:03,330
telephone pole here is on one of our

00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:07,950
towers looking from behind the antennas

00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:10,490
and if you look right here this is GSP

00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:14,640
International Airport in greer

00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:17,400
greenville spartanburg airport this is

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,500
the nano bridge this this radio right

00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,390
here will do about five miles and isn't

00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:28,710
it the radio itself is like 95 bucks

00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:30,780
this guy right here is it's a 34dd dish

00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:35,150
to directional dish it's four feet wide

00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,150
and can do 60 plus miles

00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:53,839
look

00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:57,079
and and also we do not use each client

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:59,420
does not get a each client does not get

00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:01,729
a dedicated point-to-point link we use

00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,559
within the sect Orioles this happens to

00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:05,930
be a back of one of our sect Orioles a

00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:08,509
sectoral is a directional antenna in our

00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:12,859
case 120 degrees which a client then

00:56:08,509 --> 00:56:15,319
connects to and this is one of our most

00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:18,709
creative installs this we did an outdoor

00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:20,509
Wi-Fi and we installed it to look like

00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:23,959
that because we didn't want people

00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:26,749
stealing our radio so it looks like part

00:56:23,959 --> 00:56:33,829
of the building and this is actually in

00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:37,489
downtown Greenville and not telling you

00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:41,690
um this is actually looking at the

00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:44,209
building where the sectoral was yes yes

00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:47,979
yes I did and I did I did a lot of these

00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:47,979
installs with the help of my coworker

00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:58,289
where what geographic location

00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:08,700
downtown Greenville that's took to talk

00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:11,250
to me afterwards here's another one that

00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,510
we did this is actually for that an

00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,180
install that we did for the city of

00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:18,750
pickens this is that is it an outdoor on

00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:21,420
a light post we told the city to provide

00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:23,580
us power grade mounted this box right

00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,900
here that has a power outlet that we put

00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:31,920
our injectors this radio right here

00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:34,560
receives the signal from the sect oriole

00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,770
and then the clients connect on this

00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:45,170
radio right here so there is no wires

00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:47,520
running past this box right here misu

00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:52,070
then that loops the pictures any final

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,070
questions I'm almost out of time yes

00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:59,059
well the long story we're trying but

00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:00,920
Aaron is being a pain in the ass Aaron

00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:03,980
is the people who assign IP addresses

00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:08,020
and North America we're having some

00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,020
paperwork issues with them yes Joe

00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:16,260
we have one that is eight miles coming

00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,640
off of our sect oriole that client

00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,140
needed internet so bad that they

00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,350
installed a three-foot dish on their

00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,350
roof

00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:28,600
final questions yes

00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:33,200
what was that

00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:39,230
that client was only paying for five by

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:41,540
five and we have three three tiers three

00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,310
by three five by five and ten by ten if

00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,869
you want more speed than that elin and

00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:48,590
live in the Upstate give me a call we

00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:53,840
can make a custom port we can do about

00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:56,090
50 50 by 50 unlicensed but ubiquity does

00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,700
make a non-licensed radio winning in 24

00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:02,869
gigahertz that can do 700 megs symmetric

00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:05,630
at less than six miles and it and it's

00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:10,220
get better three thousand dollars for

00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:11,960
the two radios yes so three thousand

00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,859
dollars will get you 700 megs symmetric

00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,859
at less than six miles

00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:20,120
all right oh that's my presentation

00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,120
thank you for coming

00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,390
your customers rely on your website or

01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,760
application if it's slower

01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:07,700
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,530
and costs you money keeping your

01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:13,019
business critical systems humming along

01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:15,359
requires insight into what they're doing

01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:17,309
your system metrics tells stories

01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,319
stories that can reveal performance

01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:21,630
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,219
other problems but how do you keep an

01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:25,859
eye on all of your systems performance

01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:28,890
metrics in real-time and record this

01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:30,659
data for later analysis enter longview

01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:32,669
the new way to see what's really going

01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:34,829
on under the hood the long view

01:00:32,669 --> 01:00:36,899
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:39,329
of all your systems providing you with a

01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:42,719
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:45,299
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,069
load and network usage click a specific

01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:49,469
system to access its individual

01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:51,979
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:00:49,469 --> 01:00:54,359
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:00:51,979 --> 01:00:56,039
comprehensive network data including

01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:58,349
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,939
available on the network tab and disk

01:00:58,349 --> 01:01:01,859
rights and free space on the disk

01:00:59,939 --> 01:01:04,679
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:07,229
displays usage statistics for individual

01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:09,390
processes the system info tab shows

01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:11,640
listening services active connections

01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:13,769
and available updates adding long view

01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,479
to a system is easy just click the

01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:17,609
button copy the one line installation

01:01:15,479 --> 01:01:20,039
command then run the command on your

01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:21,749
linux system to complete the process the

01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:23,939
agent will begin collecting data and

01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:25,780
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:28,360
start rolling

01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:30,730
use longview to gain visibility into

01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:34,470
your servers so when your website or app

01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:34,470
