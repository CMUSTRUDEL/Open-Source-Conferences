the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,250

pc org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,300
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,310
videos possible hello i'm deb nicholson

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,910
we're going to talk about software

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,559
patents trolls and then non trolls and

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,440
i'm going to use that term fairly

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
loosely because we've been seeing some

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,030
disturbing trends over the last couple

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,489
of years so unless you have not been

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,539
paying any attention you're aware of the

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,180
troll problem right so it's been it's

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,000
been covered pretty thoroughly and and

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,430
there's like there might be people that

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,460
are like Walt rolls you know like people

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,039
that like modern-day sociopaths are like

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,760
I mean it's a business model but most of

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,229
us are like yeah now so in case you have

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,119
been hiding under a rock just to give

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,630
you like kind of some of the scale of

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,700
the problem this is from 2011 and most

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,520
of the numbers when we talk about patent

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,400
suits and patents granted do this kind

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,040
of exponential growth so just imagine

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,640
whatever that number was in 2011 is now

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,140
a larger number in 2014 but this is 80

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,240
billion dollars and this is a

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,119
combination of lawsuit fees lost revenue

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,659
lost focus products that never came to

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,040
market so lost shareholder value there's

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:43,829
James besten who's at Boston University

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,710
has like a complex algorithm that he

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,320
uses to show just how disgusting and

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,210
terrible the problem is and so in 2011

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,380
he estimated at about 80 million per

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,570
year this is from

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,869
another group the patent freedom this is

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,829
the number of suits involving

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,270
non-practicing entities so just like you

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,070
know just like all kinds of folks like

00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,080
to have a name that they're called

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:11,590
that's usually different than one you

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,620
might think of they have a name they're

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,690
not they don't like to be called trolls

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,239
I don't care if you're sad or not but

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,220
that so a lot of the academic journals

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,260
in an effort to see more professional

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,660
and a little less nursery school name

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,420
Kali refer to them as non-practicing

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,130
entities or sometimes to be even to put

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,360
a finer point on it they will call them

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,860
a patent aggression entity so we've seen

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,840
in the last couple of years that patent

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,810
trolls have been increasingly targeting

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,660
smaller and mid-sized projects and not

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,880
super small but like getting at people's

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,980
customers rather than the makers of

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,670
technology so instead of going after

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,769
like you know the people that make some

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,079
kind of CMS they'll go after the people

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,630
who are using it and hit them like at a

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,489
smaller amount so they're like oh man

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,560
it's almost not even worth calling our

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,269
IT vendor to see if they know about this

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,190
already and just to pay it and go away

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,870
and you know so they'll try and hit them

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,329
for like 5 grand or something like that

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,280
and so this tactic is being used about

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,170
forty percent of the time where they're

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,269
like you don't really know what software

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,579
you're running but you're using it and

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,069
the seems like sort of a legitimate suit

00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:22,660
so it'll cost you more to figure out

00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:25,810
what's going on to maybe you'll just pay

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,090
us it turns out the trolls are

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,730
everywhere like absolutely everywhere

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,340
and in just the past year it seems like

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,260
everyone finally noticed like the NPR

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,069
did another spot where they you know

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,230
went and saw the pile of junk mail a lot

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,359
of academics wrote about the problem not

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,670
only Colleen 10 and James Besson that I

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,950
mentioned the Government Accounting

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,959
Office which you may not be aware of

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,670
this but there is like one branch of the

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,760
government that all the other branches

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,920
hate they look at someone's budget and

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,739
they're like so this ten billion dollars

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,509
a year for invisible planes that we've

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,319
been giving you for like the last eight

00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:05,790
years like I mean I understand I

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,040
journey that I don't see the invisible

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,859
planes but like there don't seem to be

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,329
any so they write studies like this and

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,359
so they also kind of looked at the

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:19,530
impact of patent aggression entities on

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:23,220
American businesses the FTC has plans

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,160
they've they've done lee 22 350-page

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,070
reports on the topic it's not quite in

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,780
their wheelhouse they're supposed to be

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,849
regulating trade and a lot of times what

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,400
they do is try and figure out if

00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:37,139
something is an unfair monopoly but

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,759
because of the trolls are separate and

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,360
they're all different industries it

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,729
doesn't qualify for their their usual be

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,520
so but they have just inked they've

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,160
basically wrote 350 page letters to

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,990
Congress saying like if you decided that

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,509
we should do something we're totally

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,620
ready we already did the homework

00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,380
Congress didn't decide that yet

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,280
unfortunately although legislation is

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,970
being talked about when this is a piece

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,740
of one of the primary nonprofit

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,449
proponents of this is the electronic

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,770
frontier to frontier foundation and

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,979
they've been very active on this issue

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,320
it's called the innovation at one of the

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,909
pieces is heightened pleading and this

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,599
is its kind of I'm going to try and

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:23,400
unpack these legal terms it means that

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:25,380
you would have to actually describe with

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,720
the patent and the claims and the

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,789
product that you're suing on behalf on

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,940
basis of you couldn't just be like it

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,099
seems like you're infringing one of our

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,940
patents you would actually have to say

00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:41,699
like what what patent what product what

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,830
invention it seems weird that this is

00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:47,520
not already the case but this is not

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,310
already the case fee-shifting this this

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,500
would be super helpful for larger

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,590
defendants that have money to fight a

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,900
patent suit because then when they win

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,930
like when the defendant wins like Newegg

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,139
or red hat they would get the money back

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,259
from the troll or the patent aggression

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,780
entity so that's a good thing a

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,160
discovery abuse

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,190
I don't know if we have lawyers I don't

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,750
want to like give you guys okay great so

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,490
i will just go ahead and talk as if we

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,900
do not have lawyers in room i'm also not

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,320
a lawyer just you know but discovery of

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,360
use um this is discovery as part of a

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,610
lawsuit first there's a letter that says

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,040
like hey we're going to sue you and then

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,080
once the case moves forward you don't

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,150
settle immediately on the first letter

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,520
they send you this thing like well in

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,800
order for us to have the proper

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,500
information for this lawsuit you need to

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,280
provide like 30,000 pages of like BS

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,800
documents for us even if like what they

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,720
only need is like three pages but it's

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,340
one of the ways that they make it seem

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,190
more annoying like you get that second

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,980
letter and you're like oh my god you're

00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,500
kidding twelve years of records on like

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:04,120
what we've been using for a Wi-Fi card

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,530
and every machine like yeah no way so

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,570
stopping discovery abuse would be like

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,570
that you could you could complain to the

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,780
judge and be like a 12 year old years of

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:19,760
like total BS like really maybe like no

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:22,370
no no okay only two if many years ago I

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,410
worked as a sistent in a law office and

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,140
like there's there's nothing more

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,600
demoralizing than making seven copies of

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,970
30,000 pages of documents that you know

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,740
no one's going to read so we should get

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,169
rid of this just for humanitarian

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,750
reasons so like you know so paralegals

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:40,789
aren't jumping out of buildings but it

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,150
would also take a lot of the cost and

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:47,419
the sting out of patent suits a better

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,789
transparency so this means disclosing

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,910
the real party in interest so if you're

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:55,669
like i'm steve corporation and then i'm

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,770
going to open up another company called

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,260
Tom corporation and now I'm going to sue

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,479
under the name of Tom but then I have a

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,520
contractual deal where like ninety-eight

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,530
percent of the proceeds from a lawsuits

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,360
go back to Steve then you would have to

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,280
disclose that like if you have a parent

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,960
company or something like that and this

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,150
would be good for companies that care

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,190
what you think of them but for companies

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,650
that are large enough like maybe

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,349
Microsoft to not care what you think of

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,160
them like this might not this might not

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:26,060
be a deterrent

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,970
um limited protection for end users so

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,970
there's a I want to get the there's a

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,849
term in in Europe where they call the

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,890
innocent user defense so this means if

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,500
you're a user but not a builder of the

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,020
software that you would not you wouldn't

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,990
get sued the parent company could come

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,840
in and say like oh hey how about don't

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,940
do our customers to us which is fine if

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,000
you're large enough again to take on the

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,380
lawsuit and do those things so you know

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,600
you can kind of see like some of these

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,030
are of general utility some of these are

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,280
of more utility for larger companies

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,710
that can you know throw a couple of

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,660
million dollars into let go we might get

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:14,600
it back bucket for a while so that's a

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:18,530
little different so this one actually

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,390
sounds great review the patent at the US

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,450
patent and trade office while litigation

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,730
goes on holds so you send a suit you

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:30,140
know like oh I want to see you under

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:32,480
patent like 3472 and and then you're

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,140
like oh well let's have the USPTO look

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,420
at that one again sadly this one not on

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,370
the table anymore somehow someone

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,690
someone got to Congress and convince

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,050
them that we didn't need to go to that

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,690
one not sure who so what does all of

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,210
this mean for the future I think in a

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,830
nutshell it means if you have money most

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:56,410
of your problems around the patent

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,790
system may eventually get fixed may not

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,400
definitely because it's congress a

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,820
little bit of a black box there but if

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,100
you don't have money that only a few of

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,680
the problems that hit you on the patent

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,480
system are going to get fixed so the

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,190
patented system still has huge problems

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,390
otherwise I could just stop talking and

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,750
video like go home call your

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,790
congressperson will be done not not so

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,810
great so the toll business model is

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:25,100
actually pretty lucrative so you would

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,600
think like hearing all of these

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,490
different things about how trolls

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,800
operate that most people would be like

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,900
that's despicable right like if you

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,000
heard someone like they said like oh

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,550
yeah

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,100
make a the other day I saw the story on

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,980
the news where little lady and Ally got

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,800
her purse stolen but you know and you'd

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,050
be like that's terrible instead what we

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,260
have is practicing entities being like

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:53,260
where do you find the little old ladies

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,420
so we talk about that and honestly it

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,360
doesn't matter if it's an actual company

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,580
or a troll if this is you because you

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,880
still are out all the money right it

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:08,250
just that's that's a that's becomes like

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,240
a an academic distinction correct so

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,670
there's a couple ways this has been

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,450
happening practicing entities have been

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:20,440
selling their patents to subsidiaries

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:23,010
which is you know it's its growth let me

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,830
see if I can i have some numbers for you

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:29,140
so tolls don't have to care about like

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,150
fair reasonable non-discriminatory so

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,980
companies that are in the same industry

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,890
aren't supposed to see each other to

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,140
deep down the stat so like telephone

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,030
companies like handset companies can't

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,010
be like well yours makes calls in mind

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,420
makes calls you know so they're not

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,040
supposed to be able to see each other

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,800
too far on down the staff but if you're

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,540
like but yours also makes toast and we

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,940
thought a toast first like okay that's

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,210
not you know that doesn't wipe out any

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,450
competitor so that's what the friend

00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:02,680
doctrine is intended to hit but what we

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:05,640
see is so microsoft and nokia sold

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,460
patents to a non-practicing subsidiary

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,770
it used to be called MOS aid and now

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,680
it's called conversent but the those

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,210
patents it's like 2,000 of them they

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,089
sold on for about a hundred bucks apiece

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:24,790
and some some large percentage of any

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:28,630
revenue gained from the use of those

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,060
patents goes back to microsoft so this

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,370
is a

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,080
these are these are the kinds of things

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,030
are like well maybe we don't have put

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,230
our own name on it and we just want to

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:42,120
like let some a subsidiary monetize that

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,550
the thing about conversent this

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,360
particular subsidiary is that they're

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,610
they're incorporated in West Texas which

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,520
is where all the patent lawsuits happen

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,330
in the US that I found out recently that

00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,180
that that that that a particular

00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:04,590
district as whole has like a average

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,450
juror age of like 70 so it's not a and I

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,180
don't mean that to be ages but like it's

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,580
it's never been a tech center this so

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,190
there's like a lot of folks that don't

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,950
really they're like that computer reads

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,290
it sounded really complicated I'm sure

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,660
you worked very hard you know so it's

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,240
that's why that district is kind of

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,030
coveted and then they have they now have

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,620
lawyers there that are primed to take

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:34,980
advantage of that districts strengths so

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,500
conversant is a is incorporated there

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,360
but also they're opening an office in

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,570
Ottawa so they're looking to bring this

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,070
troll business model to Canada and then

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,870
also to Europe's they're opening an

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,510
office in Luxembourg which I'm told is

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,090
the Delaware of Europe it's kind of

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:53,100
super easy to incorporate there anyway

00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,390
so so that's that's kind of what

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,650
happened what is happening they're like

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,930
oh we've got this great thing going on

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,000
in the US where we like you know we go

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,250
and get special pieces of paper from the

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,150
USPTO and then we use them to make money

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,980
like let's see if we can export that so

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,860
so that's like one way then some of them

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,340
are getting their patents from real

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,520
companies so you see that you see

00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,860
anti-competitive suits where people

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,420
nuisance lisu their competitor not

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,920
because they truly believe that they're

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,780
infringing their patents but because

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,800
they know it will just be a pain in the

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:31,170
butt for them and then you see like

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,330
usually larger companies sort of sending

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,880
these cross-licensing requests to

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,630
smaller competitors and and when I say

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,390
request like its kind

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,760
la you know the first one is going to be

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,660
a request the second one's going to be

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,150
lawsuit so you know it depends on where

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,280
you know how much do they want easy

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:56,230
money or do they want slightly harder

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:58,920
bigger money so another place that we've

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,240
been seeing this blurred line between

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,480
practicing entities and non-practicing

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,480
entities is universities they do

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,580
research they produce patents and they

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,070
also happen to almost always need money

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:18,700
so so you know it's it's this if you

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,170
have no morals it's a win-win but you

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,330
know so we see like intellectual

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:25,000
Ventures has relationships with

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,740
approximately 300 universities worldwide

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,040
and those are only the ones that we

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,020
could find mention of for folks you

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,760
don't know intellectual Ventures is sort

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,790
of like what all the other patent trolls

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,570
want to be when they grow up so there

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,460
they have like something like at least

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,430
40,000 patents in the u.s. maybe more

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,530
they it's like 300 different shell

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,690
corporations like a constant moving

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:54,760
target headed up by Nathan Myhrvold so

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,670
so intellectual Ventures is is huge and

00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,430
global and has these schools like

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,400
basically making more patents for them

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:06,640
to go back and monetize on the rest of

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,640
us so you think you're looking at

00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,820
schools and practicing entities and

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,110
businesses but actually they're all

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,060
turning into patent trolls they look

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,650
they that you can't tell the difference

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:23,680
anymore they are walking among us so

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,870
that's you know I think that's that's a

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,210
little different because I think from a

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,920
policy perspective when we think about

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,170
like well what should we do and and

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,570
Congress is very focused on the troll

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,310
problem and an NPR has been talking

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,700
about the troll problem and they're like

00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,890
that you know as Americans like we get

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,380
really upset and really there are people

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,450
getting money for not doing work I'm

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,769
working I'm not into that so like you

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,179
know people give you upset

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,089
about that you know unless their

00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:54,249
children or something but you know so

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,739
that with all the focus on the troll

00:16:54,249 --> 00:17:00,220
problem we're kind of missing this fuzzy

00:16:56,739 --> 00:17:03,249
line we're like you know they're turning

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,929
into our schools and our businesses but

00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:11,939
they're still doing troll things so what

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:16,390
do we do about that right well let's see

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,730
now for a tiny bit of good news the US

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,720
Court system has been slightly more clue

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,549
phul in the last couple of months in New

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,350
York State so this is state level it

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:28,960
doesn't necessarily apply to anything

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:31,990
that happens in any other state but

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,270
there was this a mphj and I actually

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,760
couldn't find what that stood for

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:39,100
technology licensing they were ordered

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,870
to repay all of their money from their

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,460
suits they sent out a ton of letters to

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,799
a ton of different companies in New York

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,539
not saying what they were suing them on

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,750
but saying like it seems like you're

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:52,480
infringing on one of our patents that we

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:56,110
won't name or give you the title / or

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,960
like anything no all right so the the

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,700
court in New York State said you

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,630
actually have to make a serious good

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:08,320
faith effort to figure out if you if the

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:10,570
patent you hold actually pertains to the

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,940
business that you're suing like you

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,980
can't just send letters to people which

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,710
seems like well that should have already

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,559
been the case but that's not and then

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,470
made them give all the money back which

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:28,090
is the real leg okay Wow go New York

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,010
right so you know we may see some more

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,049
local smacking down but this is not the

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,990
case like they're not the way the court

00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:36,429
system is is that the rest of the states

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,110
don't have to pay any attention to

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,940
what's happening in New York so that

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,169
just means that trolls will probably

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:46,659
avoid New York for a while this case

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:49,720
which was decided earlier this month

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:52,710
Akamai versus limelight akamai's said

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,890
that limelight and its users are

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:59,430
together creating a process

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:03,940
that infringes on a patent that we hold

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:05,920
which is kind of like wait so over here

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,690
we've provided software and then over

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,380
here the users have decided to do

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,120
something with it and because you think

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,880
that whole process is something that you

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,110
hold a patent on that that limelight

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,210
should pay you this just put it mildly

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,550
like it is completely the wrong

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,620
direction instead of narrowing the scope

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,750
of what we consider patentable or

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,850
infringement it would all just kind of

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,200
open it up like you know especially with

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,490
free software where it kind of says

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,390
right in there you can do anything you

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:40,090
want with it right so a lot of like eff

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:45,300
did and amicus like friend-of-the-court

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:47,980
brief eff did a red hat like ton and and

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,770
the court finally said earlier this week

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,930
our earlier this month no there is no

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:56,230
such thing as contributory infringement

00:19:52,930 --> 00:20:00,580
wear to parties together do a thing that

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:03,370
is infringement so that's good so it

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,680
doesn't really affect any of the single

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,840
infringement cases that they have there

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,940
there are zillions of but it does say

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,980
like no we're not going to take this new

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:16,120
type of infringement that Akamai

00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:20,260
invented which is good bio snake vs

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:23,920
Nautilus this one is it's kind of it's

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,700
it's to two companies that have a heart

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,340
rate monitor on exercise equipment and

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,310
and this one is just of interest because

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,760
they struck down the patent because they

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:39,340
said it wasn't clear enough you know but

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,230
then and also that like maybe it might

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,260
have also been obvious so it's kind of

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,090
it's this thing where the patent said we

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,580
put the heart rate monitor where your

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,770
hand is but the hand is the place where

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,450
you read the heart rate and then the

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,990
part of the infringement that was

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,880
alleged was that it was hand sized which

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,920
for something that you used with your

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,690
hand is sort of obvious like why would

00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,169
you make it foot sized if you're going

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,960
to put your

00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:07,210
and on it I don't know but so the kid

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,489
the cords basically says like you you

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,710
can't sue someone for making a hand size

00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:16,299
hand thing because it was supposed to

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:18,940
always be for the hand duh so that was a

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:22,590
to indefinite and then also with like a

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,909
side of obvious so that so they you know

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,919
just to kind of paint this picture of

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,559
the court basically being like you know

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,220
I actually did read this one and decided

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:35,529
no that's silly sovereign versus new ink

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,929
this is one that the Supreme Court was

00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:43,210
asked to hear and so this one a

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:45,909
sovereign sued newegg for infringing

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:49,419
it's shopping cart patents and so

00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:51,720
sovereign one in Texas and then lost at

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:54,159
the federal circuit level level and then

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,129
then they appealed again and were like

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,259
wait wait we Saturn's like but our

00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:03,009
shopping cart patents and the Supreme

00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:04,690
Court was like no no we're fine with the

00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:09,609
way the Federal Circuit left that as

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:10,960
like no it's too it's too obvious we're

00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:14,289
not going to we're not going to revisit

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,289
that for you this is a quote from the

00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:20,799
owner of sovereign said it's really

00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:22,629
tough time to be patent on her and this

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,539
is just to keep in mind this is like a

00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:28,929
patent that was filed in 1994 and and

00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:30,789
published in 1998 so like you know it's

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,679
got maybe like another six months to

00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:34,690
life on it anyway and she was hoping to

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,019
squeeze out a couple more dollars you

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:42,159
know so I kind of find any violence but

00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:46,239
for for the CEO of sovereign good and

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,799
then the the new one so this is this

00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,450
actually marks like the second year in a

00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,950
row that I've showed up at the southeast

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,350
linux fest and like there's been some

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,220
giant news on the software patent front

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:59,080
like within two days of my arrival last

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,529
year it was that Obama guy had like a

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,759
ton to say and you know a lot of people

00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,919
kind of wanted to know like how's that

00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,059
affect things like yeah the President of

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,240
the United States I should probably

00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:12,790
include that

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,860
like three pages worth of initiatives

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:20,330
this is another thing from the Supreme

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:23,570
Court the Alice vs. CLS bank this is

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,760
basically a financial thing where you

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,010
have two parties doing business and then

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,230
you have a third party that kind of acts

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,450
as a referee or intermediary to make

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,460
sure that leg this is being counted

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,730
correctly and being paid for correctly

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:43,490
it's not it is definitely not rocket

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:45,790
science so I but the the reason that it

00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,230
got so far was that it was like

00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:51,890
surrounded by all this language that is

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:57,110
basically but the intermediary is on a

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:58,940
computer it's like oh whoa oh hi tech

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,200
like okay well you know so it got

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,500
through the system where they're like

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,740
you know oh okay and so finally the

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,720
Supreme Court said like you can't take

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,179
something that's super obvious and then

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,520
just put it on a general-purpose

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:16,550
computer like that's no longer okay

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,270
there is no more magical patentability

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:23,809
for it is on a computer which is great

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,400
it's not quite enough like I don't want

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:28,280
to crush the good news quite so quickly

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,830
this is what we call like a 101 so it's

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,780
like none it's not patentable subject

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,179
matter to take something that people

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,760
already do regularly that's like an

00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:40,460
abstract idea or like a part of nature

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,480
and then just add and then you do some

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,270
stuff to it on a general-purpose

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,220
computer they did kind of look into it

00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,260
and they're like maybe they sort of left

00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,830
the door open like maybe if it's a like

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,440
extra special computer or has like a

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:57,290
hardware component one of the famous

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,990
cases is diamond versus deer and this is

00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:04,520
a kind of created some of the precedent

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:06,970
for software and hardware working

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,550
together creating a patentable idea

00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:12,710
company that makes a that makes tires

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,590
and so they had software that controlled

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,980
like extremely specialized hardware that

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:20,990
interacts with tires and so that's you

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,470
know that seems like yeah okay a lot of

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,440
that is the

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,090
hardware but a lot of the software cases

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,110
and the precedence is that we've seen

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:32,270
from that somehow lost the hardware idea

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,570
they were like well I mean this computer

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:38,390
seems pretty special okay but the

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,549
Supreme Court has said like you you

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,289
can't do like just general stuff on a

00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,720
general-purpose computer but they left

00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:47,720
the door open for if you do special

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,690
stuff on a general-purpose computer or

00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,450
if you do general stuff on a special

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,620
computer that might still be patentable

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,140
if that and those are that's kind of

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,840
like in the 102 or the or the 103 that's

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,789
another piece of the the law that

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,280
describes like what you can and cannot

00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:05,570
have a patent on so it's kind of like

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,100
maybe you can think of it as like one

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:11,780
down two to go in in broad strokes you

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,030
know who knows if the Supreme Court

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,740
counts their points the same way that we

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,750
count their points I kind of was

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,820
wondering the other day like you know if

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,559
you if you act in a play like you go

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,570
when you read the you know what the

00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,940
reviewers had to say the next day and I

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,100
i wonder if like the supremes go and

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,049
look at patent Leo or you know ARS

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,760
technica or tech dirt to be like I

00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:34,190
wonder how they thought that brief went

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,440
like probably not they maybe they don't

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,850
have time for that but they would learn

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,890
a lot if they did so all of that is to

00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:47,030
say that so we've had some good news but

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,919
predators may not be stopped so we there

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:53,720
is still some work to do and some things

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,760
to think about so what can we do we

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,850
could ignore it and wait to get eaten by

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,880
the Velociraptor thing or we could look

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,440
at some community solutions and then

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,490
working on some policy stuff ourselves

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,990
so we'll take those eat differently one

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,760
of the community solutions so I work at

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,130
the open invention network we run a

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,750
non-aggression pact for linux can you

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,659
android and a lot of free and open

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,250
source software tools basically we got

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:21,110
like 800 companies to sign this thing

00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,000
saying that they wouldn't sue any of the

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,890
other 800 companies in in the in the

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,050
area and that they would provide a

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,440
keylock free cross license for each of

00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:34,590
their own patents in that area so that

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,670
you know takes the amount of suing down

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:41,490
a good notch which is which is important

00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:43,560
when we started we had like you know six

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,750
companies so now we're 800 so that's a

00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,600
lot less companies that will sue you if

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,580
you sign on we also have a defensive

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,830
patent pool where we maintain patents

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,630
and there are people looking at doing

00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,610
these for other areas we just happen to

00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:00,570
be the group that's doing it for the new

00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,310
linux android development tools area but

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,020
this is basically like figuring out

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,570
strategic patents so that if you got

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,650
sued from outside the community could

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:13,230
you counter sue and with what use the

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,150
GPL which has a patent Clause this means

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,360
if you write something or Apache like

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:21,750
you know I happen to be a fan of the GPL

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,580
but using a modern patent a modern

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,580
license that mentions patents that says

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,770
like you can use my code for any purpose

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,540
but you cannot come back and sue me for

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,420
patent infringement on the code that I

00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,580
gave you so and that's not the legal

00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,800
definition but that's that's the

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,550
important that and the apache licenses

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,200
is to the DPO is coming out this year I

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,000
will see it's it's still a few months

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,430
away it's kind of in beta but this is

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,230
basically like if you have patents you

00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,200
could attach a license to them saying

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,820
like you can use this as long as you

00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,480
don't sue me it's a little bit more

00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:01,050
general we'll see how that comes out

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,600
when it's like ready for prime time and

00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,880
then you could also lobby for software

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,330
specific reforms to your local patent

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,810
regime or at least call that person that

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:15,480
claims to represent you down in Congress

00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:17,220
you know occasionally so each each

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,270
patent system has its own challenges

00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:23,220
different countries like you know I I

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,920
talk about this when I go outside the US

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,480
and like I use and they're like

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,130
basically I get some version of like why

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:35,300
you guys

00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:38,210
crazy like I don't know but um we have

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,340
there are there are folks in the u.s.

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,940
like specifically working towards

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:46,370
bringing other countries into

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,300
harmonization with our patent regime any

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,580
time you will hear the word

00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,500
harmonization you know that person is

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,350
not in your best interest like they're

00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,890
there they used a giant fancy word to be

00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:00,500
like why don't you be more like I want

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:04,790
you to which is almost never good for

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:09,020
you so so we've been seeing like the

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:11,210
u.s. like sort of leveraging IP policy

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,320
against physical trade policy and we're

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,020
apparently one of the only countries

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,900
that does this so you know like

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,700
Australia has a ton of kangaroo meat or

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,670
bauxite or whatever it is they have

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,710
there to sell and the u.s. is like ah

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:27,520
sure would be a theme if all that

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,140
kangaroo meat went rotting or something

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,840
but we could take a lot of it off your

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:39,440
hands if you were to harmonize with us

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:43,490
on IP policy so so it's not just random

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,100
one country's decide to change or you

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,470
know come closer to the US on their IP

00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:52,160
policy there's an actual initiative

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:55,370
under way to make that happen so going

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:59,690
back to us like specific where we may

00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:01,220
have some power to change things we

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,840
could we could push for a complete

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,420
transparency when the suits are brought

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,430
I think that piece of the innovation act

00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:13,280
is great and helps up and down the board

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:15,470
I think going at like the you know

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,870
legislatively the way that the patent

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,390
system works at its root and not just

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:22,550
kind of talking about what you can sue

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,560
on what you can't sue on but much

00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,720
shorter lifespans for software patents

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,630
like two years maybe something like that

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,460
would be a little bit closer and I am

00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:35,090
arguing for this specific to software

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,820
like I think we have plenty of software

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,920
patent holders to take on while we

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,080
consider reform in this area without

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,470
also pissing off

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:49,330
Big Pharma so I don't recommend you know

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:51,310
like work on those separate eliminating

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,710
functional claiming by requiring less

00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,210
fuzziness in patent application so

00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,670
fuzziness is not a legal term but

00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,730
functional claiming is functional

00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:03,670
claiming means that you you don't say

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:06,070
like I thought of an idea that needs a

00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,350
solution and that's kind of what you get

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,210
a patent for now so you said you go to

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:13,900
the USPTO and you say like I thought of

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:16,480
this I found this problem and and I

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,440
would like to fix it using software and

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,410
the USPTO says like okay will produce 30

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,590
pages of verbiage and some charts and

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,330
we'll do that will give you that but

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,460
functional claiming says you actually

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,760
have to say how you will fix the problem

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:37,030
that you can't just say software is how

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:43,750
you will fix the problem well yeah I

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:44,950
mean that's we win yeah yeah I mean

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,890
there are some other problems of the

00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,050
USPTO which we'll talk about one is that

00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:54,010
we sort of financially incentivize the

00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:57,100
Patent Office to offer patents so they

00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,720
get a certain amount of fees for looking

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,780
at an application and then they get more

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,910
fees for actually printing a patent

00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,100
application so they're sort of always

00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,770
working on your team to help you get the

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,570
patent because they know government jobs

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,510
there's always cutbacks there's always

00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,850
budget cuts like you know that it

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,740
doesn't take a super genius to

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,380
understand that the more money that

00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,810
comes in the more of us are likely to

00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,780
keep our jobs so financially

00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:28,600
incentivizing the Patent Office is not a

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,390
great plan some of the individual

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,340
activities that we might consider just

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:36,520
wanting to see how we are on time I want

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,710
to leave time for questions so help with

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,220
patent busting we have we did some of

00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,630
that at Linux defenders and I'll give

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,730
you guys some links for some of the

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,890
places where you can look at patents

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,600
that are going to be granted or have

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,610
already been granted in our under review

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,110
for some reason or other

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:58,330
tell your lawmakers why this matters to

00:33:53,110 --> 00:34:00,580
you I think that so for it like I have

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,929
parents who are like you do that tech

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,789
thing I don't really know what it is but

00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,759
we're proud of you because it seems like

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,649
they consistently pay you and stuff and

00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,389
yeah so it's like you know and

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:12,879
occasionally like I got that like oh I

00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,950
just saw this thing on NPR and is that

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,099
do you do that like your kind of okay

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,710
but I think for most of the folks who

00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:24,609
didn't come to spend their weekend at a

00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:26,800
linux fest software patents are this

00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,409
thing that like giant companies like

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,169
Sony and Apple and Google and Microsoft

00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,869
fight over and they don't know it's kind

00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:39,159
of like it's sort of hard to drum up a

00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:42,099
lot of sympathy like and Microsoft is

00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,990
losing what is it six million or ten

00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,839
million i don't know but a lot right

00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,790
like no one cares like that's not that

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,649
doesn't really pull the heartstrings of

00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,389
the american people to like get

00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:56,530
something done on this terrible problem

00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:58,540
so you know the but the smaller

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,130
companies don't get a lot of press so I

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,829
think you know talking to folks about

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,470
like this is not only like two ginormous

00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:07,599
companies that have several billion

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,970
dollars to use to fight each other in a

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,589
public way this is affecting smaller and

00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,780
mid-sized companies this is making it

00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:16,329
harder for us to get people to use free

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,040
software because we can't say like well

00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:20,980
if anyone sees you like just let us know

00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,390
and we'll handle it you know so if your

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,780
coat is that does not describe your

00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:29,800
company then you know then you see where

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,420
this is an unfair disadvantage so I'm

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,180
talking to your colleagues and Friends

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,400
of a anti-competitive behavior it's not

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,700
only trolls although the trolls are

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,750
hilarious I mentioned Nathan Myhrvold

00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:46,119
before this is a man who intellectual

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:50,050
Ventures has so many shell corporations

00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:54,099
he sits on the board think of Disney or

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:56,079
one of the like one of the Arcanum one

00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:58,359
of the entertainment companies and a

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,310
piece of intellectual Ventures actually

00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:01,840
sued this company that he sits on the

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,330
board of

00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,580
so a journalist notice this and was like

00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:09,160
huh that's really funny it's like

00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,080
intellectual Ventures like Nathan

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,590
Myhrvold suit himself and you wrote

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:17,010
about it like huh and then that company

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:21,220
was quietly dropped from the list of

00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,230
defendants so oh I mean I don't know

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,580
like Nathan Merville doesn't call me up

00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,520
I don't get invited to these meetings

00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:31,540
but it seems like he did sue himself and

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,090
then didn't notice until it was called

00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,710
out by a journalist so you know so the

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:38,290
troll stories are hilarious and

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,300
ridiculous and like you know everyone's

00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,950
ready to get the pitchforks together and

00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,470
go down and figure out where he lives or

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,870
whatever i'm not advocating that i don't

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,550
want a pitchfork I'm a city girl but you

00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,850
know letting know that it's not always

00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:54,430
that sometimes it's the less you know

00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,710
the less stark black-and-white kind of

00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:00,910
story it's like a larger companies doing

00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:03,430
a slightly smaller competitor I don't

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:06,010
know if anyone has seen the readers that

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,870
folks who are visually impaired used for

00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,240
using their computer there's two

00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,870
companies that do that the slightly

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,480
larger ones sued the smaller one and

00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:19,570
because they wanted the whole market and

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:23,440
so what happened was that the larger one

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:27,010
lost but and they both still exist or

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,650
whatever but over the three to four

00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:33,550
years that this lawsuit went on neither

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:35,190
company produced any new features and in

00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,090
case you were wondering who pays for

00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,040
software for people with visual

00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,110
impairments it's not people with visual

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,790
impairments it's the government the

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,260
state government in most places because

00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,270
they want to help those people become

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,900
employable and and and stuff like that

00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:53,890
so so the cost of the software goes up

00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,660
as taxpayers we take that on people with

00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,280
visual impairments didn't win because

00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,550
there was no improvements to their

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,200
software but almost no one knows this

00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:06,330
outside of the community of people with

00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:10,180
visual impairments so yeah

00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:12,100
oh yeah so well that's and so like and

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,900
the only check they have is it there's

00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,560
two companies like one company has many

00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,910
more contracts but that one was like we

00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,130
could probably charge three times as

00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:23,470
much if we could just needle up this one

00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:25,690
competitor that it's keeping us as close

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:29,800
to reasonable as we already aren't you

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:32,140
know so anyway so there's late so

00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,790
there's the the Predators it's not only

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,050
you know it's not only the Google is in

00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:38,620
the microsoft and it's not only the

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:43,540
trolls so well we knew about the general

00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:44,740
public's attention span is a yeah so you

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,340
know while people are talking about

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:51,310
patent trolls and patent reform

00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,920
movements is hot and what we know about

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,780
practicing entities is that they might

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,940
they might spin it off into a subsidiary

00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,470
with like a name that doesn't make any

00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,150
sense or sound like it actually does

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:05,470
anything and then incorporate in Ottawa

00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:07,990
but they're still coming for you so take

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,830
your credits and these are the patent

00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:13,330
busting sites that i mentioned before so

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,850
ladies defenders that's the one that we

00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:18,670
run at oin this is specific to linux

00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:22,210
stuff and you know linux operating

00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:25,840
system so can you android etc trolling

00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:29,530
effects is the one run by eff so that's

00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:31,870
a little bit more general on you know

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,880
all kinds of software and then patents

00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,370
at stack exchange where they are looking

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,320
at patents there so they're doing you

00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:41,800
know sometimes people are sourcing prior

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,050
art which shows that a software patent

00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,610
that's being considered isn't new or

00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,220
wasn't new at the time it was granted

00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:51,700
sometimes they're looking to overturn

00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:54,070
something or find some you know some

00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,130
evidence that it was obvious when it was

00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:59,110
granted or 0 is obvious before it gets

00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,710
granted and then if you do want to read

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,200
a

00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,820
a lot of these a lot of the academic

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,190
papers tend to be pretty dense but

00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,440
Colleen Chen does a really good job she

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,080
worked with the New America Foundation

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,750
to put this publication out last year

00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,870
and it's very readable so if you if you

00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,670
want more if you are having you know

00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,560
you're sleeping too much sleeping too

00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,020
well and you want to you know have more

00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,200
statistics to keep you up this paper is

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:33,970
pretty great so I am willing to take

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,970
your questions now Thanks yes

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,160
as

00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,160
version 3 sorry

00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:52,789
no it does not the Apache License has it

00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:55,309
has a similar clause which I'm a little

00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:59,509
less familiar with all admit but the bsd

00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:01,369
license hasn't changed so gplv2 doesn't

00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:05,239
mention patents because at the time that

00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:08,419
v2 was written I think 1992 we didn't

00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:10,579
have this problem or we didn't know we

00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:14,089
didn't see it coming yet so there's no

00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:16,099
mention of patents in gplv2 bsd hasn't

00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:17,839
changed in a long time and so it

00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,549
definitely and it's only the three

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:27,890
clauses it doesn't mention anything

00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:32,539
about patents yeah i mean that's with

00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:33,949
some caveats like you know if I mean

00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:35,449
anyone can send you a letter and say

00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,369
those to you but it's like so there's

00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:39,199
kind of two questions there like could

00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,999
someone sue you like someone can always

00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,329
send you a letter and be like I sue you

00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:45,679
for a unicorn harboring like all right

00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:47,689
and then if you can't take it a court

00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:51,019
like you give them money for harboring

00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:54,769
unicorns but the the second question is

00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:57,409
if you go to court will cause the court

00:41:54,769 --> 00:42:01,279
likely to be able to rule for you or for

00:41:57,409 --> 00:42:03,439
the person bringing the suit so BSD has

00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:05,659
nothing in it that says I wrote this and

00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:07,939
didn't intend for it to be patented like

00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:10,009
the courts haven't tried this yet so

00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:12,109
there is the the second case we don't

00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:15,679
know about like we don't know how that

00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:17,419
will play out the hope by the folks who

00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,769
worked on the most recent version of the

00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:21,799
apache license and the most recent

00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:24,829
version of GPL is that it would act as a

00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:28,179
deterrent to people using your code and

00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:30,679
then patenting the functionality that

00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:32,599
it's tricky because copyright law and

00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,729
patent law are separate copyright is

00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,199
supposed to be on the written stuff and

00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:39,949
patent is supposed to be on the

00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:43,429
functionality so like a program has both

00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:46,069
a function and actual text within it and

00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:51,109
so the way that those two pieces two

00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:54,019
bodies of law interact is messy and not

00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,939
totally until it goes to court we don't

00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,770
know how all of the edge cases would

00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:59,020
play out

00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:02,980
so that's why my answer is like well

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:05,820
maybe or could be and hopefully so yeah

00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,820
yeah

00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,030
I don't know and we just talked about

00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,830
this on the way in I haven't I haven't

00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:29,340
looked into that one so closely I do

00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:31,530
think so the previous this situation

00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:37,080
like year ago is where Supreme Court

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:38,820
says in the in another case like their

00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,680
batch of cases from last year basically

00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,050
kind of said like hey you can't like

00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,450
they tried to slightly narrow the scope

00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:48,300
of patentability and the West Texas

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:51,090
Court immediately was like you know took

00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,220
this sort of Clint onian like we said is

00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:55,650
but I think you don't mean is here i

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,750
think you mean is and so we're going to

00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:00,120
go ahead and basically do what we want

00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:02,940
with this like long verbiage describing

00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:06,960
like how we were like we're actually on

00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:09,060
this side of the new line instead of on

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,890
this side because we've decided to

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,620
interpret your stuff this way so i think

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,620
it seemed like there was no way to be

00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:20,460
like hey that's not what I said like so

00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:23,460
we may be starting to see some you know

00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,740
some effort to keep the lower courts in

00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:30,300
line with the precedents as laid down by

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,310
the upper courts but it aside from that

00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,650
being like that sounds like the right

00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:39,300
direction I I couldn't say too much more

00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:41,370
but yeah that's when I I ended up

00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:46,820
looking at this one mostly before I got

00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:46,820
here the Alice case so two people yeah

00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,950
what they're like

00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:04,950
yeah newegg tried to sue them back so

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,720
like if you like when you try and go

00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:10,410
sovereign versus newegg you get a bunch

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,700
of newegg versus sovereign results but

00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,690
I'm trying to let me see if i can find

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:18,210
that there's like no I think that I

00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,850
think it's 00 the new eggs of the

00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,740
countersuit the countersuit may actually

00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:26,430
still be in progress but the sovereign

00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,670
versus newegg case has hasn't been

00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:31,260
denied appeal so I don't know I don't

00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,920
know if new eggs going to get money back

00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:38,250
from them or not but yeah that was it

00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,930
was a you know and newegg has a couple

00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,620
of those countersuits in the fire I

00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,620
think actually

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,980
yeah well and I think that's because

00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,720
it's you I knew Mike whose name I'm

00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,970
blanking on but he did a TED talk on

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,830
like if you're the money fight them

00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:59,560
because it's it like we all know it's a

00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:03,550
bunch of ridiculous stuff when you get

00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,530
like a troll suit like this and so yeah

00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,450
he's I think he went looking for a

00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,400
lawyer who was like oh yeah let me at

00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,110
them so I think that that worked out

00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,040
that works out great for everyone right

00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,040
so

00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:26,799
oh I don't remember seeing anything

00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:28,299
about a Kickstarter my impression was it

00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:30,759
the new I one was doing his own money

00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:33,069
but it might that could be a different

00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:35,679
case he's new eggs fought a couple of

00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:48,880
trolls like and so it might not be this

00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:50,439
one yeah oh I'd like to see that yeah I

00:46:48,880 --> 00:47:01,119
don't I don't remember how that one came

00:46:50,439 --> 00:47:02,920
out yeah yeah and it's it's a I mean so

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,900
the the kind of money you can raise on

00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,239
Kickstarter like generally don't get

00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:11,400
into the same like kind of stratospheric

00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,400
level of the cost of lawsuits

00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,720
yeah especially we're gonna fight a

00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,740
bunch of that you know and it's like

00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,869
yeah did the FSF had a earmark donation

00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,900
fund for a while on fighting patent

00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:33,450
suits but you know the amount in there

00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,420
was like they'd be like a third of a

00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,099
lawsuit you know I mean that you know I

00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:41,369
don't think they've pushed that recently

00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:43,020
because it's a the kind of working on

00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:46,559
the policy and as opposed to trying to

00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:48,180
be a legal defense fund but it's it's a

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:52,970
the amounts you need to raise for a

00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,970
lawsuit defense fund is pretty intense

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:13,340
so the the pancit stack exchange people

00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:17,540
will add information that they think is

00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:21,020
relevant to specific stuff but that most

00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:24,770
of them tend to focus on patents that

00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:27,500
are pending and like have not yet been

00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:29,930
granted the the process it becomes more

00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:34,300
difficult to challenge an already

00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:38,810
existing patent although we do know

00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:40,880
redhat novell were sued by a troll that

00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:43,760
had picked up a couple of old Xerox PARC

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,890
patents and they decided like it was on

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,930
x windows they're like oh that whole

00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,060
like window display object thing you

00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:52,700
know how their box shaped which is you

00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:56,210
know because everything on the computers

00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:58,520
box shape except a mac but anyway so

00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,070
like they you know they got this it was

00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:04,250
like a trio of X Windows patents and you

00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:06,110
know they decided to crowdsource stuff

00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:07,430
so I'm trying to remember the precise

00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,050
dates I think it was something like

00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:14,810
patents were granted in 89 and then

00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:16,250
because of who Red Hat is and who's part

00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,770
of their community they were able to

00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:23,000
find the folks who had archived the

00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:24,980
usenix list from 87 and 88 and and

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,600
rustle up some prior art to say like

00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,760
yeah actually when those Xerox PARC

00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,040
patents were granted they it wasn't new

00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,980
we were all using boxes for window

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,410
display objects or whatever already so

00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:39,020
that true of patents was overturned but

00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:41,000
it was like part of a lawsuit so the

00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:44,060
whole you know the whole cost of a

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,720
lawsuit had to be laid out to in order

00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:50,360
to turn over those patents so most of

00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,980
the patent busting tends to focus on new

00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,080
stuff because you want to hire a lawyer

00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,460
to do it you just kind of get someone

00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,130
who's a little bit savvy enough to help

00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,680
you write a defensive publication and

00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,450
then you submit that prior art to the US

00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,790
patent and trade office so that they can

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:07,550
they kind of know what to look at that's

00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,890
kind of the huge problem with the US

00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,530
patent and trade office is it they don't

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,150
really know where to look like if you

00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:17,150
for a more traditional feel that's like

00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,809
a physical or mechanical stuff you you

00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,160
know used to

00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:21,410
subscribe to the three journals that

00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,999
cover your area and you and you just

00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,519
read them and then you know what's new

00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:28,279
and what's not new but for software it's

00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:33,650
like well you know maybe like 12

00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:35,809
different repositories you know 1800

00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,180
worldwide conferences where people might

00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:41,209
be talking about stuff and you know so

00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:46,189
kind of just a million grains of sand to

00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:49,249
look at and so so the prior art work is

00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:52,130
in order to sort of put that into a

00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:53,449
place where it has the keywords that the

00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,449
US patent and Trade Office is looking

00:50:53,449 --> 00:51:00,079
for so that they can figure out what is

00:50:56,449 --> 00:51:03,829
new and what's not actually new does

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:10,249
that kind of answer that I thing else

00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:13,459
comments pitch works not on cool um okay

00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:16,670
I finished a little early only 10

00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:19,219
minutes um I oh I still have this from

00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:21,619
the I was at lenox west-northwest but I

00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:23,569
I wear many hats so this is one of the

00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:27,380
other ones we opened our call for papers

00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:38,079
today so okay thanks so much for coming

00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:38,079
in odeon our very first

00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:46,140
it's British well the United States oh

00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:46,140
okay it's actually

00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:55,770
a way that a hardware for their pleasure

00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:58,650
to have hardware

00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:01,470
never built that more

00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,910
so I forgot about that part somehow the

00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,290
next thing there was like okay that's

00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,370
all

00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:10,060
it's actually a little bit more

00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:11,920
complicated and I because we had so much

00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,600
we had so much stuff going on with the

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,550
legislature and with the courts this

00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,270
year like I focused really a lot on that

00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:22,860
but it was actually sort of a slow like

00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:25,030
it was a slow like 20-some years of

00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,820
general era what do you call it

00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:31,300
rationalizations like towards like from

00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:34,930
like oh well you know machines that do

00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:37,510
things and then like the machines that

00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:39,460
have stuff are on them and do things and

00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:44,380
then you know so it was like kind of

00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:45,670
this slow descent into I guess anything

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,320
on a computer because they seem really

00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:50,920
complicated you could have a patent for

00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:53,830
so I could show you some stuff off line

00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,550
from another presentation that kind of

00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:59,890
goes through it was a started in the 70s

00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,570
with a like oh well we don't know if

00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,610
this will apply to anything and then

00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:06,430
they applied this old precedent to like

00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:10,030
new stuff and you know it kind of

00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:12,310
becomes it was just a slow kind of

00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:15,340
dissent and then I think was like in the

00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:18,010
80s all of a sudden one of the cases are

00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:20,020
some blinking on like just kind of open

00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,460
the floodgates and so then like all

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:26,260
through the 90s you just see a zillion

00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:27,700
patents on software so but yeah I could

00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:31,360
talk with you more about the history

00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:34,080
later if you want but okay cool well

00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,080
thanks a lot you guys

00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:45,380
your customers rely on your website or

00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:47,780
application if it's slower

00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,720
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,550
and costs you money keeping your

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,000
business critical systems humming along

00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:58,370
requires insight into what they're doing

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,320
your system metrics tells stories

00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:02,330
stories that can reveal performance

00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,640
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:06,230
other problems but how do you keep an

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,870
eye on all of your systems performance

00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:11,900
metrics in real-time and record this

00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:13,640
data for later analysis enter longview

00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,680
the new way to see what's really going

00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,840
on under the hood the long view

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,910
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,340
of all your systems providing you with a

00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:25,730
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,310
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:30,050
load and network usage click a specific

00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,480
system to access its individual

00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:34,990
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,370
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:39,050
comprehensive network data including

00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:41,360
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,950
available on the network tab and disk

00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,840
rights and free space on the disk

00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:47,690
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,240
displays usage statistics for individual

00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:52,400
processes the system info tab shows

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,650
listening services active connections

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,780
and available updates adding long view

00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,460
to a system is easy just click the

00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,620
button copy the one line installation

00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,050
command then run the command on your

00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,760
linux system to complete the process the

00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,920
agent will begin collecting data and

00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,770
sending it to longview then the graph

00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,350
start rolling

00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:13,720
use longview to gain visibility into

00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:17,460
your servers so when your website or app

00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,460
