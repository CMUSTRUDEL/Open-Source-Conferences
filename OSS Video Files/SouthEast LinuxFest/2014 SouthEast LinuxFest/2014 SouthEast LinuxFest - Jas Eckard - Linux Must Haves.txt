00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:31,789
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:31,789
videos faucet it's jay side really okay

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:43,100
hey y'all my name is jay Secord since

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,289
it's a sunday nine o'clock i'm going to

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,840
testify i would like to all know the

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,940
reason that i I'm a Christian and the

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,469
reason that I like open source and free

00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:01,440
software is because I I believe in God

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:04,350
and the two the two things is love trust

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,119
in God above all things and the second

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,460
thing is treat others as you want to be

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,290
treated open source for me epitomizes

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,540
treating others as you want to be

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,460
treated I'm also I like to think of

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,259
myself as a scientist so I have a

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,140
scientific mind I was a physics major in

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,500
college and the thing about open source

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,830
is that the final step in in the

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,600
scientific method is publish an open

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,520
source is where you publish if you don't

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,950
release your source code you're not a

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,040
scientist you may be information

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,680
technology information whatever but so

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,759
that is why I enjoy open source software

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,040
and free software sup that's my

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,549
testimony okay so my name is Jay sacred

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,020
I have been a system administrator a

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,530
software developer and a network

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,619
engineer over my computer career and as

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,540
such I've collected a tool box of tools

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,640
that I love i'm sure everyone in here

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,259
has their own specific group of tool

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,409
tools that they have in their bat

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:09,530
utility belt this talk is about mine

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,739
just to give you some geek cred in 1996

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:16,099
was my first installation of Linux it

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:20,690
was slackware I bought a box of 50

00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:23,510
floppy diskettes and downloaded fluffy

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,269
images from slackware and put it on 50

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,700
floppies all of stock boy did not fit on

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:31,340
50 floppy so I had the trim maybe I

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,940
didn't use the tickle series and that

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,360
sort of thing but that was 1996 and just

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:42,069
have loved linux ever since so that's

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,209
about what was that 18 years or so

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,599
before that i was really wanting to do

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,370
it but i didn't have a 386 computer if

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,680
you want to access this talk later on

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,860
it's on github you can go to a truck

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,099
github I oh I've got a link to slash

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,290
links must have slit self 2014 in fact

00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,510
i'll show you that right click up and up

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,160
and up and up and up da that now I

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:10,130
didn't do it nevermind okay but if you

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,670
go to truck that github daioh it'll have

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:16,910
a link to this talk truck is my handle

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,709
on github I named my hand or my handle

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,780
comes from the name that I gave my truck

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,500
so my truck is named truck so I took

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:28,700
truck as my handle and of course this is

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,019
that's because every talk that you see

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:35,900
online from Southeast links messages

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,060
that and so I said what the heck so

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,470
linux must-haves the programs that i

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,500
can't believe aren't installed in the

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:46,040
default distribution installation what

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,840
this is is my personal group of programs

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,099
that i find so incredibly useful that i

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,150
have to install them right after i

00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:54,650
install a distribution of anything and

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,139
like i say i'm sure everyone in here has

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,090
their own particular utilities and tools

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,290
this is mine when you give a talk you're

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,410
supposed to talk about what you know

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,049
this is what I know so as such it's it's

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,549
a list of about forty programs but I

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,660
don't have time to go over each one of

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,459
them i'm going to go through them as

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,400
fast as i can so I'm talking really fast

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,140
and an entertainer so this talk will

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,730
have a lot of breath I'm going to expose

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,470
you to a lot of stuff

00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,030
but it's not going to be a lot of depth

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,760
if you want a little more information

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,400
about the the programs in particular you

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,740
can come see me anytime I'm sure people

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,890
in your linux users group or online or

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,270
read the man page right read the

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,310
documentation so you can think of this

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,050
is like a series of lightning talks

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,160
about programm programm programm

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,530
programm so my goal is if you're a new

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,640
person to linux you will be exposed to a

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,410
lot of different programs that you've

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,360
never heard of before but if you're if

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,640
you're an old-timer you've been around

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,660
like me for a long time hopefully i'm

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,860
going to give you that one little

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,660
luggage of the program that you know

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,070
really well anyway and you're going to

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,100
say ah didn't know it did that and

00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,870
you're just going to love it for that as

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,520
such because my list is 40 and i've gone

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,880
through and practiced it and i only got

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,350
into about 19 i'm going to not take any

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,940
questions normally I take questions

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,650
because i love questions because i learn

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,240
whenever I get a question like I don't

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,340
know I didn't know that it did that and

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,680
then I get to learn from that but I

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,910
understand like right now I'm being a

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,250
little and I may not be

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,030
understood and sometimes i mumble I'm

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,830
from the South y'all and so if you don't

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,570
understand what I say that's when you

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,490
raise your hand and I will repeat it if

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,950
you don't understand what i said when i

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,480
repeated because it made no sense then

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,000
raise your hand again and I'll restate

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,590
it does that make sense groovy all right

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,300
go so this is my list I it's a list that

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,800
you can't read it and I know you can't

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,560
read it because it's too small but it's

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,540
40 programs or support of your so it's a

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,970
Google spreadsheet that I've got online

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,100
I've got to print outs here if anyone

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,420
would like to copy up so as you're going

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,190
along you might write little notes in

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,510
the margin or what have you but I got

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,460
printouts here I like to have handouts

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,260
whenever I'm giving a talk I also like

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,520
to give demos but because I'm going

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,040
through this really fast i'm not going

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,610
to be able to give a demo to anything so

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,960
feel free Oh someone grab a big chunk

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,500
and pass it down the road or something

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,910
like that sorry I did feed for that to

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,950
happen okay so this is my list if you

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,560
notice on the left side are the program

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,480
names the names of the programs are oh I

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,940
only did 20 because I was expecting to

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:35,950
people

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:41,800
so I'm sorry y'all okay so use firefox

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:43,990
then so anyway okay so on the left is

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,270
the name of the programs and you see on

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,460
across the top that's the distribution

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:52,090
that I have discovered the package names

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,650
of these programs are in and you'll

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,170
notice that some of them are blank as I

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,480
go along that's when I've added more

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,010
items to my list and I just haven't used

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,050
that distro since the last time I

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,660
updated list that's what that is if you

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,400
see a why or an n that means yes it's

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,260
automatically it's in the default

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,670
destroyed no means that it's just not in

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,920
the repositories or anything like that

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,320
so the first program that I ever use

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,780
whenever I go to any system is screen

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,850
screen is so incredibly useful you think

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,560
of it as a it's kind of a session it's a

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,900
shell session manager when you launch

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
screen you get your bash prompt right

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,900
back now the great thing about screen is

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,880
that you can launch screen and detach it

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,880
and it goes in the background and then

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,730
you can reattach later to your screen

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,560
session so imagine you've got a

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,180
long-running process or your do you're

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,890
tailing a log or something like that and

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,280
it's scrolling off the screen but you've

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,230
got to take your laptop home with you

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,960
what you do is you detach it before or

00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,090
you can just leave it whatever then when

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,980
you Rhea when you get back home you

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,750
reattach in that screen is suddenly

00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,190
there and it's picking up where you left

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:04,570
off it's just a fantastic program inside

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,340
of screen you do a control ad to detach

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,100
the current screen session that you're

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,560
in control a is the signal to screen

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:16,570
that the next command will be a screen

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,330
command so and there's a there's a lot

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,560
of other control a things whenever you

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,640
bring up the help you can see all those

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,620
and read the documentation so with on

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,050
the command line screen dash LS will

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,510
list for you all of your screen sessions

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,640
that you have currently running I'm so

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:38,880
normally breathe whenever I'm whenever

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,669
i'm logging into a system and say i'm

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,950
writing a program i give a screen a

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,480
session name of that program so that I

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,600
know where I'm at or if I log into

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,970
another system that I'm not the only

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,010
person that logs in is that user I'll

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,880
give it my name or ID sometimes I just

00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:00,670
put the host name of a machine whenever

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,410
you read the way to reattach to a screen

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:09,330
session is a dashed lowercase R

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:11,860
lowercase D screen dash lowercase R will

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,350
reattach to a previous screen session

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,490
lowercase D will detach from a screen

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,170
session so you've got screen session

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,330
running somewhere else and you say no I

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,470
want to hear so you detach it gets put

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,890
in the background and then you reattach

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,140
it to where you are but I always use the

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,270
power detaching the power reattach which

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,510
is a capitalized versions of the capital

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,060
d 4 kappa for power detach and capital R

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,540
Furr powered reattach and I give it a

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,040
session name as i had mentioned before

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,800
usually whenever I log into a system I

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,050
always always just do screened str and

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,900
then session name once I've listed see

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,810
if it's already there or not the dash X

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,600
screen dash X and then session name does

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,980
a multi attach a multi reattach so

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,410
you've got screen already what I

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,370
normally do is I have to two x terms and

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:03,070
I log into a system and i reattached to

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,780
a screen session i have a second x term

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,900
and I log into that same system at a

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,550
screen dash dr and are reattached to

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,620
that same screen session now suddenly

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,600
everything that i'm typing is happening

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,250
on both sides i usually do that i have

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,860
like several windows in one screen

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,550
session so i have you know code in this

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,580
window of the screen and i have the

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,410
logging of the other one or the output

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,000
of the program that sort of thing i

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,070
don't know if that makes sense does that

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,339
make sense to anyone that's never used

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,860
it for how ok good ok so a lot of people

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,320
when they a lot of old-timers like me

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,870
that have used or seen screen they like

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,579
I don't like it because once it Scrolls

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,400
off the screen is gone forever and I

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,990
can't when I use my ex Turman and I want

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,940
to scroll up it's not there

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,610
well the thing is that it doesn't scroll

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,520
off it does it doesn't scroll off the

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,160
x-term it scrolls into the buffer of

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,420
screen so it's still there but you can't

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,810
see it what you have to do is use

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,880
control a escape and that use your page

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,610
up and that sort of thing to go up into

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,950
the screens buffer because you were over

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,750
here in that X term it may have scrolled

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,610
off onto that but you've reattached here

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,480
and its goals off necessary that make

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,399
sense so control a escape is actually

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,440
copy and paste mode but I never use it

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,779
for that I always use it to to look at

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,820
what's in the buffer way above now I'd

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,399
give it a talk on screen several years

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,899
ago and my up sick at the Upstate

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,870
Carolina links users group which I'm a

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:34,570
member of the log there and I was

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,240
explaining all the the virtues of screen

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,950
and this guy was in in the audience and

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,480
he's looking and didn't understand all

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,860
this and he had this facial expression I

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,540
couldn't quite figure out what was what

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,690
was wrong with him and I was explaining

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,029
that control a is is the the signal to

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,010
screen to do some sort of thing and so

00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,589
it's got our it's a problem whenever you

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,870
using like minicom which is a serial

00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,970
communication program because it also

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,690
uses control a you have to do control a

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,420
a through screen to tell screen to send

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,980
a control a to mini calm and that sort

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,899
of thing and he's sitting there like

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,579
this and he's like I thought that's what

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:13,089
screen did and I'm like I beg your

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:15,940
pardon that's what he uses for serial

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:19,329
communication so I was it blew me away

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,040
so the 22 people in this in this room

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,050
I've been using screen for screen

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,850
purposes he's being using it for serial

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,980
purposes from that point forward I've

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,980
always been connecting to my Cisco's

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,250
over my null modem using the serial

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,510
aspect of screen so for your old timers

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,600
if you didn't know that was there it

00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,120
blew me away some alternatives to screen

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,339
if you're not interested in looking into

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,040
screen are detached which I understand

00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:48,670
was originally a fork but they took out

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:53,230
all the features team ucks I think was

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:56,079
kind of a rewrite way yay and then but

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,180
bo boo is a kind of a wrapper around

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,290
both either team ox or screen and it

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,480
just gives you the prettiness

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,949
configuration sort of things of probably

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,579
what you're going to want to have so

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:11,959
those are some alternatives to screen

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:19,699
they are altered the bo bo is is a

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:24,050
rapper actually yes you can use the dash

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:27,670
dr and then session name to create a

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:31,970
brand new session called session name

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:36,259
mmm aha see this is an old-timer okay

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:40,399
them is the penultimate no this is the

00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:42,110
ultimate text editor now I use vim like

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,389
I can't tell you how much I now

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,509
absolutely love them them as the fit is

00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:50,120
just a fantastic a text editor I use it

00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:53,779
as my word processor as well I also use

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,120
it as my IDE because it's just so

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,509
incredibly useful the thing you have to

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,970
know about vim vim is VI improved that's

00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,130
where the name comes from VI is the

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,829
granddaddy and it's the visual editor

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:11,779
it's it's a very old program from long

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:14,480
ago and it's just a in the time when you

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,660
had just a line and you would have to

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,470
print out the lines of your program

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,660
visual VI the visual editor was just a

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,569
wonderful thing the thing you have to

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,550
understand about VI and them is that it

00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:30,649
is a modal text editor when you launch

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,800
vim you are automatically in edit mode

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:36,319
and edit mode is not content creation

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,120
mode edit mode is where you want to copy

00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:39,620
and paste and move stuff around you've

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,089
already got your content right there you

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,010
want to manipulate it you want to swap

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,060
words you want to capitalize or

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,240
something like that you can cut and

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,399
paste that sort of thing but any time

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,720
you hit escape and it'll go into edit

00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,540
mode so if you're in one of the other

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,569
modes you hit escape it'll go into edit

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,880
mode the other the second mode is insert

00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:03,350
mode and you do that by by typing the

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,420
command I in edit mode I will insert and

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,860
that from that point now anything that

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,050
you type is actually what gets printed

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,360
onto the screen otherwise the characters

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:14,889
that you're typing in edit mode are

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:19,069
doing things d deletes and for example

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:21,920
excuse me the third mode is the colon

00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:23,839
mode or the command line mode and the

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,000
command line mode just has a lot of cool

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,690
things that you can do that's the

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,269
original old-time editor functionality

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,870
of it so whenever I gave this talk at my

00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,370
lug several years ago I created this

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,860
this rhyme so that everyone could

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,810
remember because if you're ever using

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,100
them or VI for the first time it's gonna

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,839
you're going to mess up your you're

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,199
editing your document you're gonna go

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,879
and you're going to panic right it has

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:53,120
that ever happened to anyone you got I

00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,790
just know I just screwed it up well if

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,970
yourself you're going to hang escape

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,399
colon q bang if yourself you're going to

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,579
hang escape colon qbank if you're going

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,310
to hang yourself before you do that you

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:09,199
type escape colon cube bang what that

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,339
does is escape put you into edit mode no

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,899
matter which mode you're in if you're in

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,939
edit mode does nothing if you're in

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,589
color mode it just goes into edit mode

00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,689
if you're an insert mode it goes into

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:21,680
edit mode colon puts you in the command

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:25,250
line mode right so escape colon q is to

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,930
quit bang is to quit without saving so

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,490
if you ever messed up and you're like oh

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,709
what am I going to do escape calling

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,290
qbank if yourself you're going to hang

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:41,389
escape colon cubing anyone like that

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:46,459
yeah okay yeah the in in them just like

00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:47,779
in the VI your arrow keys are hjkl now

00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:51,589
if you look at your right hand on your

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:56,180
keyboard that is J and K is down and up

00:16:51,589 --> 00:17:00,230
down and up for the camera index and

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:03,259
middle finger and then H and and L are

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,679
left and right like this so left is the

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:09,079
left finger that's H right is ring

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,020
finger l so that's left and right that's

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,720
up and down okay makes sense and that's

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,819
just it's that's in edit mode of course

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,199
and it's that way you don't have to

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,280
remove your hand from the key of the

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,470
home row now them added on the

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,659
understanding arrow keys so if you're

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,190
using old-time vim arrow keys are just

00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:31,100
going to put gobbledygook on you

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,050
green because it's the its commands that

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,680
it doesn't understand but vim added the

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,450
functionality so if you're used to it

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,610
you can lift your hand and put it to the

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,590
arrow keys to move around and then put

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,590
it back so that's one of the great

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,090
things one of the features of them one

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,200
of the other great features of them that

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:54,320
VI did not have is the help colon help

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,210
and any other commands or any mode or

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,750
anything that's that is available in vim

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,800
it's online just from the colon command

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,230
another cool feature that I didn't know

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,500
about until years ago and until recently

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,310
is if you have if you're hovering over a

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,710
word in your document you type control k

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:18,890
for keyword control k will pull up the

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:22,760
man page for that word that you're on so

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,080
if you're on if you're in a c-cup you're

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,480
writing a sea program or something like

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,520
that you type a function you're on top

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,770
of a function control k it'll bring up

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,650
the man page for that function if you're

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:38,180
in a bash shell script you type control

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:40,700
k it will love bring up the man page for

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,080
that command it's just it's just really

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,530
one of those cool features that you

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,990
didn't know about of course now there

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,910
are man pages for printf there's printf

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:54,230
for see there's print tough for bosch

00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:57,800
built-ins and there's a printf for the

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,900
the program called printf so if you want

00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,270
to go into the particular chapter of man

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,160
page you do three control k and that

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:08,300
will go to chapter three of the main

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,740
page for that so GV m is the GUI version

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:15,350
of them vim works course in the console

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,810
the terminal and GBM is a GUI version of

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,340
it and it has adds a lot of the gooey

00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:22,940
stuff that you're probably used to

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:25,610
control the ctrl c ctrl x ctrl z I'll

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,260
which I get rid of because I'm been

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,550
using that for years but you're probably

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,710
more familiar you can copy and paste

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:34,040
with the mouse it's a lot of cool stuff

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:37,070
the killer app for me for them is them

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:41,000
diff and what it is it's a diff program

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,370
but it visually puts the two or four or

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,620
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,690
files that you have given it and side by

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,610
side it color rises the different lines

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,950
and it color eise's the different

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,010
characters that that are between the two

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,760
and that's just really cool so

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,980
alternatives to them are the old

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,650
fashioned VI which i think the source

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,930
code has been released Elvis was when I

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,570
was way back when I was a slackware guy

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:09,890
it was the default editor so I learned

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:13,010
Elvis first n VI is the canoe nu VI vial

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,140
is stands for VI like Emacs if you're

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:19,130
more like that and I got to say alright

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:22,310
so here's the thing if you use Emacs I

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,530
respect you you know you're wrong but I

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,590
respect you I respect your beliefs so

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:30,620
but if you're not using the VI and

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,600
you're not using Emacs you're not a real

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,970
hacker you're not a real programmer I

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:39,110
mean cove on to the text editors though

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:42,350
that are so simple I'm sorry a soapbox

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,200
here but but I recommend that you learn

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,890
either you max or via them because

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,450
there's just one the functionality

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,360
here's the thing I've got in my mind

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:58,490
this graph of productivity productivity

00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:01,390
over time as you go along something like

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,220
nano orgy edit you can become very fun

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,680
very quickly right because it's really

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,130
easy to use but you plateau and your

00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,230
function in your functionality with VI

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,610
it's very hard to learn it's very hard

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,770
to learn so your productivity because is

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,960
terrible at the beginning but as the

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,150
years go by your productivity shoots

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,970
through the roof now so if you're ever

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,380
going to want to so okay so the

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,110
productivity where you here at the

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,770
beginning I'm not taking questions but

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,300
if you'd like me to repeat I can okay so

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,350
productivity increases over time so if

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,870
you're ever going to if you're going to

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:41,510
learn them and VI I recommend maybe 15

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,990
minutes a day for the first two months

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,450
five months year whatever until you get

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,330
to the hang of it and as you use it you

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,580
will find that it is just something you

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,790
cannot live without like I am like like

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,790
Nate

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,440
rsync is a program that copies files it

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,840
copies files within a file system it

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,309
copies files across the network the cool

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,309
thing about our sink is it has this

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,049
rolling or some people called sliding

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:14,080
checksum window and what that means is

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:17,010
you have your original file and your

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,169
target file and if the file names match

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,270
it's going to check do a checksum on I

00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:24,789
don't know is it a bite or something

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,650
like that it does a checksum of every

00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:29,950
bite as it's going along in this sliding

00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,360
or rolling window and if there's no

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,730
difference in the checksum it doesn't

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,120
bother copying that bike worth or to

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:41,230
bite or kilobyte or whatever it is so

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,730
that you have a much faster copy now so

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,980
it only copies over the diff so if

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,809
you've changed this file over here and

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,090
you just change like five characters

00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:50,890
it's going to go and then and then it

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:54,640
actually copies those five characters

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:56,049
and it continues on if you if your

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,190
connection gets cut in the middle or you

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:02,020
kill your coffees your rsync session so

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,520
the checksum is going to match up until

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,900
that point where it's new and that's

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,710
when it starts copying so it's a much

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:11,490
faster copying of files because it only

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,960
copies what's new what's different

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,630
excuse me in the past there's been an

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,600
rsync demon but nowadays i only use over

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:23,440
ssh and and that way you you don't have

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,659
your rsync demon running two to four a

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,620
potential attack and I always use the

00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:33,010
dash capital P AV that does a recursive

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,590
it does a the percentage in a GUI sort

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,390
of thing and i have found since i've

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:42,100
started using it several several years

00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:45,039
ago i just put in my bash RC i just

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,200
replaced copy and secure copy with rsync

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,299
I never use copy anymore I never use

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,580
secure copy anymore it's arcing I have

00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:55,120
it as an alias in my bash RC though so I

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:58,360
could cause it's shorter CP vs arsenal

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,700
PAB so it's so incredibly useful for me

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,499
that that's what i do i use rsync for my

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,600
copy community

00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:06,950
get now you've probably been here this

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,590
weekend and you've heard the word get

00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,869
and if you're new you're like what is it

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,570
the sullen axis and they're saying get

00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:16,909
no it's get is a distributed version

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:20,090
control system version control systems

00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:22,879
are when you're for code when you check

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,379
it in and it saves it and and you do a

00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:26,090
difference and it saves and you do

00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,470
difference and the reason for that is

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,539
you may want to go back to three

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,730
versions ago but you don't have it on

00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:35,090
your file system anymore so you use a

00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:37,070
version control system to go back the

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,960
distributed version control system

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,600
traditionally version control systems

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,919
have a have a server or a master of some

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,049
sort and then you're the client so you

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,549
it's kind of like a library you check

00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,899
out the stuff and then you check it back

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,779
in you check out the stuff and you check

00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:53,419
it back in with a distributed version

00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,850
control system it's all flat everyone

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,980
has the same priority now in a lot of

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,980
places you'll have a server that is your

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,359
your git repository but you don't have

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,429
to check in everything to you don't have

00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:07,570
to commit everything and push it up to

00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:10,580
there the cool thing about get is the

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,279
ability to branch so let's say you're

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,080
working on our program and you're at 2.3

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,889
and you want to add a new feature that's

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:23,779
that's in your list for 2.4 you create a

00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:25,519
branch called 2.4 feature alpha and you

00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,869
start working on it and you're working

00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,159
you add in your feature you're putting

00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,989
your coding you're checking it in

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,779
suddenly get a call from your customer

00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:36,080
it's not working in 2.3 and so you have

00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:38,690
to go Oh what do I do now so what you do

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,210
is you you commit you to that branch and

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,720
then you go back to the 2.3 branch and

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:46,369
it's a seamless operation the files get

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,139
changed automatically and you start

00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:50,059
working on that you commit to that and

00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:54,019
you check in your code your fixture then

00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:56,659
you go back to your feature branch so

00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:58,220
that's one of the beauties of get is

00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:00,590
that it does that another cool thing

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,950
that that when the cool features of get

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,720
is the bisect command and what that is

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,690
so you you've got a customer who's on

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,570
1.2 you're working on 2.3 they want to

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,309
upgrade to 2.3 from 1.2 and they say you

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,869
know the feature that that we're the

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:15,950
only customer that ever uses that

00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,289
feature

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,789
is not working in 2.3 why is it not

00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:22,190
working and you're like well it worked

00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:23,570
before so you know that it was working

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,669
in two point one point two because

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,110
that's what they're using and they say

00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,440
that it's not working in 2.3 but you

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:33,950
don't know we're in the process of 1.2

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,019
1.3 1.4 2 point 0 2.1 that it that it

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,929
died so you use a bisect command and

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:42,769
what that does is it it goes between the

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:44,990
two code revisions in the middle and so

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:48,169
what you do is you check out are you uh

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:50,539
you get the buis you bisect that then

00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,179
you've got you compile that code and see

00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:54,710
if it's there or not if it is there the

00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,419
function or the feature is still there

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,370
then that means that it's between these

00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,649
two so you bisect there and it's kind of

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,149
a binary tree sort of thing if it wasn't

00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,320
there and you need good bisect between

00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:05,269
that so that's one of the other cool

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,990
things about now I've been talking about

00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:11,450
using it for code because I as my

00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,649
programmer had but whenever I'm a system

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,269
administrator I use it for my

00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:17,269
configuration as well everything in my

00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:19,490
etsy directory and any other

00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,740
configuration you want to you probably

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,409
would like to have a version control

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,440
system so i use get for that purpose i

00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:30,559
recommend it github is probably one of

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,409
the oh I didn't mention that that gets

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,970
probably now one of the most common

00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,200
version control system so you've

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,970
probably heard of several times like I'd

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:43,990
mention github is is a website that you

00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:48,260
can check in and check out code from

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:51,200
using git but github adds to its the

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,210
social element where you can check out

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,269
other people's codes and that sort of

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:59,299
thing and it also has well you see my

00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:02,299
website is on github two or this

00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,889
presentation is there github is another

00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:06,799
command that helps you understand the

00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:08,240
the insides it's an online help firm but

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,230
it reads like a man page it's set up

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,350
like a man page locate is another

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:17,120
program that I can't believe is not on

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,549
the default institution because it's

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,279
part of the fine utils software package

00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:24,409
but some distributions break it out find

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,519
is in your is going to be on your

00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:31,879
distribution but locate may or may not

00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,099
baffles my mind but find locate is a

00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:36,529
quick way to find programs on your

00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:38,599
system and does the whole system and

00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:42,619
basically what happens is it does a find

00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:45,109
on your root directory and just as a

00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:47,179
cron job like once a night it does the

00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:48,950
entire file system saves it to a file

00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:51,499
and basically locate greps that file

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,609
that space simple enough but I don't

00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:53,959
know why it's not installed because

00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:57,080
normally you would have to use your fine

00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:59,239
command watch is a program that is a

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,639
process for Peter so you know how when

00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:03,200
you use top you've got you know the

00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,519
statistics across the top and then

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,979
you've got your processes and it

00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,139
refreshes every second or two seconds or

00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:11,989
something like that watch does this for

00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:14,029
any program so you're for example you

00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:15,919
want to you know that you're downloading

00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:19,549
a file and you want to watch the file

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,919
size increase you do watch L stl file

00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,079
name and then it'll have a listing and

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,759
then as it's going along every two

00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,559
seconds by default you can change the

00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,859
settings every two seconds you'll see

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,969
the file size increase or not increase

00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:34,070
and then you know you've got a problem

00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:37,669
but if it increases that's good or you

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,979
know you may stop whatever so I'd seen a

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,320
talk earlier this weekend and someone we

00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:46,579
had done this manual they did while true

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,190
do something sleep one done what watches

00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:51,200
a lot less characters than all that so

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,489
but I mean that works because then it

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,769
Scrolls off screen you can see history

00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:56,269
but watch does this automatically now

00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,999
the thing that watch does do that the

00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:02,119
that it do while while do loop doesn't

00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:04,279
do is if you give watch a dash D it will

00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:07,549
show you in Reverse video the

00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,349
differences of the last time so if

00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:12,049
you're doing a file copy you'll see the

00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:15,619
the file size just the the last two or

00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:19,299
last three but have a reverse video does

00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:21,679
that make sense I'm getting a lot of uh

00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:24,489
but that's okay I'm talking too fast and

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,479
probably am completely understandable

00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:30,139
all right now here's my network

00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:35,589
administrator hab nslookup is a is a

00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:39,739
program to do a DNS lookup of a of

00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:42,290
either a domain name or IP address so

00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:44,420
it's a DNS query tool it will go

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:47,720
to your etsy resolv.conf and find out

00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:51,680
who your DNS servers are and then you

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,100
say you do nslookup google com and it

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,890
will ask your DNS servers in resolv.conf

00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:01,070
who is google com and it will reply with

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:07,070
the IP addresses that google com is or

00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:10,550
if you say nslookup 23 24 26 to 27 it

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:15,920
will ask the DNS servers what's 23 24 25

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:18,320
26 7 and it'll say that's yahoo com or

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,380
something like whatever the cool thing

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,560
about nslookup in addition to that is

00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,360
you can it has a command line version so

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,490
you type nslookup and then you get a

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,530
prompt then you can type google com and

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,600
it'll tell you that you have yahoo com

00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,310
and they'll do that so instead of having

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,440
that type in its look up every time on

00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,680
the bash prompt it gives you an nslookup

00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,960
prompt and from that you can also change

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,270
you know I'm looking for MX records so

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,820
you set the type equal to MX records or

00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:50,480
MX you can look for see names for a

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:53,000
names that sort of thing also with that

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,660
you can tell it I don't want to use the

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the DNS in my resolv.conf I want to use

00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,390
some other DNS so what does Google think

00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,830
that they are so you use Google's DNS

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:09,850
aight aight aight and say it is my

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:13,190
resolver and then it nslookup asks that

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:17,180
dns server and that's what you get if

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:22,720
you look at the RFC for dns it says that

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:25,490
nslookup is it deprecated thank you is

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,090
deprecated but I'm old-school you know

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:34,600
so I i still use it but the two that it

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:34,600
recommends our dig and host so

00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:38,859
yes nslookup is the only it's really the

00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:44,979
only thing you can use in the shell

00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:48,549
right command is it kumed RL wrap is a

00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:50,080
red line rapper program if you're not

00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,969
familiar with what red line is it's the

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,009
library inside bash that gives you the

00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:56,229
history and some other functionality but

00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:58,509
whenever you do an up arrow in bash

00:32:56,229 --> 00:33:00,089
that's read line that's giving you the

00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,529
history that's sort of thing you commit

00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:07,210
manipulative little bit you can

00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:09,729
manipulate the history that way so what

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,729
r l rap is is it wraps any program and

00:33:09,729 --> 00:33:15,669
gives it a red line like functionality

00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:17,799
so for rebels which if you're not

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:21,279
familiar that term it's read execute

00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,960
print loops rita execute print loops or

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,190
command line program programs that have

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,639
a command line is basically what I'm

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,409
saying so the problem with red line is

00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:33,369
is that it's under the GPL if you want

00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:35,589
to put the red line library into your

00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:38,080
program you have to abide by the GPL and

00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:41,649
therefore your program has now be GPL

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,089
that's by design by the way so there's a

00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:46,239
lot of programs that don't have a red

00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:48,039
line library because of them so for

00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:50,139
those programs you use RL wrap and then

00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,460
that program and now you've got a

00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:54,249
history all of a sudden it's also a

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,799
quick and dirty way that's qnd quick and

00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:58,299
dirty way to have a history in whatever

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,729
program that you're creating or some

00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:02,710
other program that you've got so it just

00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:04,779
gives you a quick history what it does

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,539
is it saves it to your home directory as

00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:08,889
a dot whatever the whatever the program

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:11,020
named I history or something like that I

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:14,349
use it a lot for nslookup and it's

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,929
lookup doesn't have a history so I do RL

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:18,490
wrap and it's look up whenever I want to

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,869
do the command line version of anise

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:24,039
look up and that's what I use for them

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:25,869
and also works in command CMD I use it

00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,440
just the other day just to test and I

00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:31,720
hate the the dos command line history

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:37,629
it's just it's just weird I prefer red

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:42,069
line version synergy is a it's you can

00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:45,309
think of it as a kvm without the V kvm

00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:47,109
of course is a keyboard video mouse and

00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:48,889
usually it's it's you know you got this

00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:50,960
box that you plug in all

00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,000
cables too you've gotta you know series

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,010
of computers and you plug in the

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,760
keyboards and mouses and you change

00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:01,010
between and the keyboard video and mouse

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,130
that are at the desk go from one machine

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:07,279
to the next that's what a kvm is but so

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,920
synergy is and because synergy also runs

00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:13,460
on Windows it also runs on OS X you can

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,839
have say my what I have in my my home

00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,569
are having the passage I don't have

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,819
anymore and my home in the past I've had

00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:22,299
my linux box in the center I've got my

00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:27,380
windows box to the right and my

00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:30,410
macintosh to the left but I those two

00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,480
keyboards and mouses are crap I like my

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,579
keyboard and my mouse that that are

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,230
plugged into my linux box because i'm

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,019
going to be using linux mostly but any

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,549
of those times that i have to use that

00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:43,579
what you do is you set it up then

00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:46,819
whenever I use my mouse and the pointer

00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:49,130
scrolls off of my to the end of my linux

00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:50,960
screen and I go right even further it's

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,799
suddenly on my Macintosh anything that I

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,990
type anything a copy and paste is a this

00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:58,730
is the window sight isn't it is copied

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,799
and pasted from my Windows machine and

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,089
it's in the cut buffer in my linux box

00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:08,240
now I can go over to over to the windows

00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:09,980
box and paste what i had over here so

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,069
it's just a really cool thing and just

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,930
because I've got the server on linux the

00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:17,240
synergy server running here and two

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,029
senators energies clients running on the

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,829
windows and the Macintosh doesn't mean

00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:23,809
that if you have to use that keyboard

00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:25,220
and mouse and you want to you can have

00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,380
this one as the server and this one is

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,730
the client as well so you've got a

00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,589
client enter server running here a

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,970
client and server running here and so

00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,950
you use this mouse that you can say

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,569
right and it comes over on this screen

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,890
you go right even further when it comes

00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,750
out on this screen and you have the you

00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,670
know whatever but such synergy is one of

00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,099
those programs that if you have

00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,339
multi-headed different operating systems

00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:51,319
different machines it's just a cool way

00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:52,730
to use that I'm not getting any cheers I

00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:56,660
was expecting some of these programs

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:58,910
good yeah no got a program expect is one

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,520
of those really cool programs as a

00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:05,300
system administrator you

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:07,570
so you log into different places and you

00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,950
can't script putting in the password

00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,710
because that's from a that's on a

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,990
different tilt type by design expect

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:18,110
will allow you to do that what the

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:22,330
basics of the expect programming

00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:28,280
language our sin and expect so I send us

00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:31,820
ssh to phu kham i expect password prompt

00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,890
i send password I expect bash prompt and

00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,810
that's the basics of it so it's a

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,810
scripting language it's written in

00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:42,770
tickle the two tool control language TCL

00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:45,350
and tickle for me maybe it's because I

00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:47,750
come from a C and a bash background it's

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,280
a little strange of a language but

00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,010
whenever I had to write an expect script

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,410
I I have to refresh myself and I can use

00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,450
it but so but if you're not familiar

00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:03,350
with tickle you have to learn tickle to

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:06,590
know expect auto expect is a program to

00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:08,270
create an expect script auto expect is

00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,940
written in expect which is written in

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:13,010
tickle and what it does is let's say

00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:17,060
okay I want a prototype that I'm

00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:19,310
connecting to alpha calm I wonder what

00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,700
have you so you type expect it because

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:25,010
she'll and you say secure shell tune Oh

00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,840
awful calm and then you see the Pratt's

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,130
write and type your password and then

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,810
you get your basketball you thumb your

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,520
banishment I want to do an LS and but

00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,890
okay that's going to do that sort of

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,680
thing what that does is then auto expect

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:40,520
will store every character that's on the

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:43,970
screen what you sent as a sin function

00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,300
what UX what you got back as the expect

00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:50,720
from that file then you can snip and

00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,130
paste you know snip out all the special

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,190
characters that you're not interested in

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:57,320
and OU another cool thing and then

00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,680
you've got your prototype of your expect

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:05,120
script that you can use for expect later

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,220
on I'd forgotten to mention this but the

00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,290
sin and expect is you send a command and

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,330
you probably expect one of three things

00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,220
you know you expect an error you expect

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,210
a the correct thing you expect blah blah

00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,280
blah

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,580
and then from that of a branch and do

00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,460
different it's different sins and

00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,369
expecting that sorting some alternatives

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:29,270
to expect our X knee which is an x11

00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:30,560
sort of robot sort of thing it'll draw

00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,740
on the screen I have never used it but I

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,530
know about it enough try expect is so

00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,560
useful that there's a library lib expect

00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:41,420
and that is built into has been ported

00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,640
to see so you can direct your C programs

00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,640
your PHP programs your Haskell programs

00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,770
there's there's others other languages

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,320
Pearl has implemented their own expect

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:53,780
and actually the last expect script that

00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,160
I wrote was a pearl expect script and I

00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,160
like it a lot better because it's not

00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,470
tickling its pearl so i've been using

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,990
perl expect python has also

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:07,820
reimplemented the idea of expect so i'm

00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,400
going to call expect the granddaddy i

00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:14,950
recommend using expect of some sort

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,930
cluster ssh is for as a program from my

00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:20,240
system administering or connecting in

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:23,420
some way to multiple computers as

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,339
different X terms so let's say you've

00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:29,410
got all your web servers you want to do

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:31,040
the same command on you want to do I

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,950
don't know you want to see how much

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,960
memory is running right then you launch

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,609
SSH with web one we have to whip three

00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,470
we have for that sort of thing it'll

00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:41,240
create a new X term for each one of

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,920
those that you commit that you created

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,320
it'll ask you for your password there's

00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,490
a little window that comes up at the

00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,130
bottom and that's where you type your

00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:51,680
password the password gets typed in all

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:56,420
of those then you get your prompt and

00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:02,000
you say cat proc memory or info proc mem

00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:04,040
info whatever it is huh free dash IAM

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,810
yeah so you do a free dash mne and it

00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:11,480
pops up on every one of those the little

00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:13,430
window at the bottom here also you can

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,200
select and choose which ones you want to

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,839
since oh so you've got these two that

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,190
you that you know are in North America

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,990
and the other two are in South America

00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,700
you want to do a command on just the

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,680
North America you uncheck these two and

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,359
anything you type in the little the

00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,880
little window here at the bottom only

00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,700
gets sent to hear

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,180
or from that you can also say oh I

00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,640
forgot about the the the web servers in

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,769
Europe so you say add Europe and so

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,440
Europe shows up as another X term and

00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:44,619
Europe two shows up as another that sort

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,839
of thing cluster SSH is something that i

00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:49,869
just recently learned that has a cluster

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,089
file so you can define in that these are

00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:53,440
my web servers these are my database

00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:56,349
servers these are my blah bitty blah

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,680
whatever and so you at the community

00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:01,329
they see it see SSH web which is the

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,430
shortcut that I created in this cluster

00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:07,079
file and it will know that those mean

00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:16,690
create four or six how about whatever

00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:21,339
the connections to that ERISA is an IRC

00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:23,049
client IRC is Internet Relay Chat I when

00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:25,630
I first got on the internet internet

00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:27,640
relay chat was the thing I'd gotten away

00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,960
from it after a couple years but now

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,420
I've discovered that it's really never

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,490
ever gone away now I use a risky because

00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,380
it's so not it's like the granddaddy of

00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,880
IRC clients it's so functional it has a

00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,829
lot of things and the great thing is

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,619
it's a command line program you can run

00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:44,410
it within screen and so I can detach

00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:47,980
reattach and I'm still where I was in my

00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:51,190
IRC conversation indent is a program to

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:54,369
I call it a code beautifier but what it

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:56,140
does is in dense well your code that's

00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,789
you know someone messed it up or you

00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,710
messed it up or you just typed it to

00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:02,920
faster you want to change the tab

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:06,099
characters to eight spaces or something

00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,200
like that indent does that for you so if

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:10,059
you're at a company and they decide they

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,359
want to you i personally prefer kar

00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:16,660
styling indentation but if you're at a

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,410
company that uses almond or bsd or one

00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:23,890
of the others you just tell indent that

00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:26,470
you want to use almond or what bsd my i

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,950
have my personal preferences there's a

00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:32,319
lot of command-line preferences i like

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,450
to cuddle my braces up at the top and

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,880
that sort of thing so I just have an

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,480
alias called Jason dent and it just

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,050
calls indent with all my flags on it

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,270
an alternative to indent is a star I

00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:48,690
started to look into a style because

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:53,880
cygwin does not have indent and it just

00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:57,570
but a style also understands a lot of

00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,720
more languages i think so i recommend if

00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:02,670
not looking into indent a stop di is a

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,890
new program for me i've only heard about

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,780
the last I don't know years so it stands

00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,790
for disc information and if you're ever

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,520
partitioning or you want to see file

00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:15,510
size or drive sizes that sort of thing

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,300
you're like me you used e f and mount DF

00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:21,570
mount mount DF mount DF back and forth

00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:24,780
di combines those two why didn't we have

00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:26,310
this years ago you know so di is simple

00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,350
enough disk information it shows your

00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:34,350
mount point and the disk full

00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:36,570
information peavey pipe view I know I

00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:40,050
don't know nearly there we go there's a

00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:43,109
cheer yeah PV is the pipe viewer and

00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,060
what that does is when you're copying a

00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:46,770
file or doing some sort of manipulation

00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,480
that takes time and it's going to take a

00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:52,859
long time what it does is it gives you a

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,990
percentage with a bar or if it doesn't

00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:57,330
know the file size it just is i call it

00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,760
a spinner but it's a bumper sort of

00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:02,520
thing back and forth until it's done so

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:07,200
it's really and it it you can use it as

00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:11,609
a replacement for cat you can pipe your

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,859
copy or our sink in my case to pv and it

00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:16,320
sends it to standard out and I'm sorry

00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:18,750
standard error the percentage so that

00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,390
that your standard in is sent to where

00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,190
it's supposed to go just as a cool thing

00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:25,350
I need to look into some more but I

00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,450
wanted to tell y'all this cool new

00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,010
program that I found out repeater is

00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,660
another cool new program that I just

00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:38,910
recently found out about it's on github

00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:42,390
and it's a process reattach ur so the

00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:47,160
Rees to again PTY is a pseudo terminal r

00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:49,650
is one who does I don't so repeaters one

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,270
who reattaches to a PTY so you've got a

00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,750
program running you forgot to launch you

00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:55,330
inside a screen

00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,940
so you launch you call a repeater with

00:45:55,330 --> 00:46:02,790
the can't remember it's probably process

00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,790
ID and it puts it in your current a

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,360
command line yeah your your shell in

00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,850
your current shell so what I normally do

00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,140
is I have my screen but i forgot to run

00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,660
this program in screen so i find out

00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,280
what the process ideas and I call

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,770
repeater and it's now suddenly in mine

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,220
it's last time I use it it's a little

00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:23,200
buggies it's new so I recommend everyone

00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:28,000
in here looking into it submitting bugs

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:32,530
or patches but that's what that is trace

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,170
route this is a network diagnostic it is

00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:38,110
a wait to find out from from here to

00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:41,320
there what are the hops from this point

00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:43,960
to another and it does this through ICMP

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,480
there's also an ipv6 version of it

00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,620
called trace route 6 in some

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,110
distributions they don't have trace

00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,870
route you have to use trace paths which

00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:55,900
is a similar idea the thing is though

00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:59,620
the TC that traceroute uses ICMP now

00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:03,850
since the the ping of death a lot of

00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:05,470
places have disabled ICMP completely and

00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,090
it drives me nuts because now suddenly

00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:09,520
traceroute doesn't work because it just

00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,890
says star on something something there's

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,200
something there so the alternative is

00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:18,130
TCP route and so what that does is it

00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,890
sends TCP packets instead of ICMP ok

00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,870
that was the network stuff you heard you

00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:27,220
may have heard Alan Hicks last night

00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:28,690
talking about the way what if your web

00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,570
browser I don't remember what he said

00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:35,260
use links is what he said links is a

00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:37,390
text web browser there's no JavaScript

00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,420
there's no CSS there's none of the

00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,100
fanciness it's just plain text on that

00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,110
you can put inside of screen that's my

00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:47,260
last item inside of screen or inside of

00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:49,390
them there's links which is the the

00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,980
older program then there's links which

00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,140
is not which is very similar to links

00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,180
but it's not like lynx lynx is links is

00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,360
less like link with links is like links

00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:01,150
all right so so whenever links doesn't

00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,250
work i type links right you're hearing

00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:08,370
the difference in the two words right

00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:10,110
so text browsers for the win the other

00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:12,840
alternative is if it doesn't render

00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:15,930
right I use w3m it's also a text based

00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,700
web browser usually though I use link

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:22,770
dash dump that we'll just dump the

00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:24,750
content to standard out there we go just

00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:27,410
dump the content of the web page to

00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,520
standard out or file if you want to

00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:32,550
anytime that you have an anchor or a

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,950
link it will put it as a footnote and

00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,140
it's really cool so you might want to

00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:40,230
use as a replacement for curl or w get

00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:43,470
because kurland w get they get the code

00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:46,380
but you're interested in the content so

00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:48,270
but links also you can use as your web

00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,000
browser you use your arrow keys to go up

00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:52,740
and down and space to go to that link

00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,530
and that sort of thing I use it within

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,120
screen so I can you know have my history

00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:00,510
and reattaching the attached i can also

00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:02,130
use it inside of them especially the

00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:05,870
links dash dump and just have that on

00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:10,320
into my text document that i'm using

00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:13,230
excuse me wow I've gone faster than I

00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:17,280
thought oh this is beyond 19 I must be

00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:19,800
really nervous I script is a program

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,900
that's probably going to be in your

00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,000
default its district institution but I

00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,090
want to put it in here because you can

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,270
think of it as a command line reporter

00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:32,850
recorder sorry if you type script a

00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:34,800
script lunch is a brand new shell it

00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:37,590
Forks off a new shell and anything that

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,300
from that point forward gets saved to a

00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,190
file called typescript by default you

00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,650
can give it a file name with a thing as

00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,390
it as you have something like that and

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:49,650
all the things that you're doing in that

00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:53,970
shell now get recorded to typescript you

00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:57,330
can also tell script to keep a timing

00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,670
file so I had planned when I was going

00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:03,270
to do this with demos because I like I

00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:05,130
prefer to give demos but because of time

00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,110
I decided against doing demos of all

00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,640
these programs what I was going to do

00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,980
was have script runs so that whenever

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,130
you went back home you could see the

00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:16,670
timing of me typing and so script replay

00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,829
if you have a timing file it will tie

00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:22,190
in the amount of time that it took me to

00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:25,970
type those letters so it's it's kind of

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:28,700
a movie you might think of the of the

00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,930
session that I've got in script one

00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,059
thing you want to be careful of when you

00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:35,480
when you have your type script is that

00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:37,280
any antsy characters anything that gets

00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,680
recorded in that type script file your

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,420
carriage return line feeds your tab

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,119
characters are tab characters if you've

00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,829
got color like I do for my prompt you'll

00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,780
see all this gobbledygook before your

00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:49,520
prompt and and and so you've got to be

00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:55,309
aware of that when you go to edit your

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:58,280
type script file XML link lint is a lint

00:50:55,309 --> 00:51:00,020
for XML they come up with strange names

00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,290
so if you're not familiar with what a

00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,700
lint is it's a syntax checker like when

00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,700
you get your towels out and you know you

00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:10,250
pick all the lint off you want to a lit

00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,960
program picks out all the syntax errors

00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,200
and that sort of thing XML lint will

00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:19,250
make sure that your XML file is

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,420
well-formed but it also does a its I

00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,309
call it a beautifier because it does a

00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,670
similar thing that indent does and it

00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:28,369
will indent your XML to the whatever you

00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,470
tell it eight spaces for me it also

00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:34,309
understands HTML which is not

00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:37,069
necessarily XML but you can give it the

00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:39,890
HTML flag and you'll do them i use it i

00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:41,770
personally use it in them it i have it

00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:45,280
as a map command so that whenever i type

00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:48,109
xml it will launch the current line

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,500
filter it through xml lint and suddenly

00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:54,140
i've got this beautiful xml well if you

00:51:51,500 --> 00:52:01,579
consider xml beautiful xml indentation

00:51:54,140 --> 00:52:06,349
indent ated indented xml stuff GPM is a

00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:08,359
general-purpose mouse this is you know

00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:10,369
you can use your mouse in eggs right

00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:13,190
that's simple enough but what about on

00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:14,869
your console what if you don't have X on

00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,950
your server because you're not going to

00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:17,809
you're going to have a headless system

00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,430
you're not going to happen well it's got

00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:22,580
to be head full sorry it has to have a

00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:25,940
head but it's a text

00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,670
it's a text mouse so you want to copy

00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,500
and paste the text use GPM general

00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:33,800
purpose mouse and you've got this

00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:37,850
inverse video block going around the

00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,610
screen it's an old school program and I

00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:46,220
still use it for my console it's a way

00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:50,120
to copy and paste wow I must really be

00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:54,170
talked about make I is a is a

00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:56,690
programmers tool it is a is a way to

00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,780
build a software through dependencies

00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:02,750
you know when you can't build this file

00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,130
without this file being in existence you

00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,950
but you can't have this file until

00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:09,590
you've compiled it with this file but

00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:12,650
you you want to rebuild this any time

00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:16,730
that this file gets changed so it's a

00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:20,570
dependency system is what make is it's

00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:22,250
it's the old school one make looks at

00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:26,030
the make file inside the current

00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:27,920
directory and I just want to just to

00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,930
give you a little taste of what a make

00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,000
file looks looks like you've got you've

00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:34,340
got your target which is some file name

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,870
colon and then whatever prerequisites

00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,700
the prerequisite so don't have to be

00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:40,910
there but if you have prerequisites if

00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:45,830
if if your target depends on something

00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:48,230
you put those there then after that you

00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:49,970
do a tab the tab character has to be a

00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,670
tab character it can't be spaces it can

00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,110
be four spaces like like like Python

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,970
understands but it has to be the tab

00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:59,060
character then you have some sort of

00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:01,310
forked compound commit the I know and

00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:05,030
the reason i put forked is whatever you

00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:07,130
put on that line has to be done as one

00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:09,620
it will make is going to fork that the

00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:11,300
command line and before it goes to the

00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,670
next one so if you do if you have this

00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,100
your first line CD to some directory and

00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,360
then you'd sell the next line you say to

00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,680
do something else that's you're

00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,720
expecting to be in the deck directory

00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,930
it's not going to work because CD was

00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,910
forked and then it exited so you haven't

00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:27,650
see deed in there in the second forked

00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,630
command so I want to make sure that that

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:34,280
was understood and you can have multiple

00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:35,990
that sort of thing I use make files not

00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,430
only to compile my code

00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,369
but anytime that there's some sort of

00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:43,880
dependencies the target doesn't have to

00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:45,320
be a file but it usually is if it's so

00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,500
like you'll you'll see in make files

00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,970
you'll see make help make help that

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,650
you're not trying to create a file

00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:56,150
called help you just wanting it to print

00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:59,270
out to the screen the help 44 make or

00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:02,450
whatever so I use it a lot not only to

00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:04,100
build but also for just general this has

00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,600
to be done before this does and this has

00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,980
to be done before this does and this has

00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,570
been done before that what I do is I

00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,770
have this is a prerequisite to this this

00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:12,500
is a prerequisite for this this is

00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:16,100
prerequisite to this and that's where

00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:19,280
thing does that make sense that's

00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:22,760
probably too much information but in VI

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:27,590
in them and VI you give a colon Mak or

00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:31,070
ma ke make and it will make whatever is

00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:34,820
in the make file so I use that I'd

00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:37,040
mentioned that them is my IDE when I use

00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,550
it as my IDE I do a colon make to build

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:43,940
whatever programs that I'm running anti

00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:47,510
word is a filter it's a program that

00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:51,290
takes your documentation that was

00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:53,830
written in Microsoft Word and makes it

00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:57,160
plain text plain text for the win

00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:59,960
because you know when i'm looking at a

00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,940
documentation i want to grab right

00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,359
because grip is the thing that you want

00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:08,119
to you don't want to go to control f and

00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:11,090
i want to manipulate so it drives me

00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:13,280
crazy when when stuff that it could very

00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:17,450
well be plain text is written as a Word

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:22,880
document so i use any word just to just

00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:25,850
to make it a plain text file so display

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,540
is a program to show in the GUI your ex

00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:31,760
windows images JPEGs gifts that sort of

00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:33,740
thing from the command line so you're in

00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,700
a you're in a directory that has all

00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,350
your family photos you type display

00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,450
Johnny riding bike for first time jpg

00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:45,190
and it'll just bring it up it's part of

00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:47,750
the image magic suite of programs and

00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:49,310
from display when you've got display up

00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,710
it'll actually go into any of those

00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,380
others

00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,320
if you're familiar with imagemagick at

00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,119
all but I use it a lot just to launch

00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:04,400
just to look at my pictures from a

00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:07,589
command line yay who is is a network

00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:13,380
administrator's best friend from that

00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:15,859
you can find out information on dns and

00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:19,250
sub that's necessarily thing about

00:57:15,859 --> 00:57:22,670
registered domain names it will tell you

00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:25,200
who it was Reggie was registered under

00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:29,490
information about dns records and that

00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:32,700
sort of thing use it a lot if I want to

00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:34,619
know you know it's not something's not

00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,560
working at one place but it is another

00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:40,050
and I you have to nslookup what what it

00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,839
is from from their point of view I do a

00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:46,020
who is to see what their dns servers are

00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:49,320
use that in NS lookup and say all right

00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:51,960
ask this DNS who it is there's a lot of

00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,790
other information if you know some

00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,010
services down there's a phone number and

00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:59,640
an email address is still phone numbers

00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:03,660
or email address of who you want to

00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:06,900
contact when they're citing working but

00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,880
you know nowadays who is stuff is online

00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,440
so i tend to use it a little more than

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,830
that I used to whenever I created this

00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:19,470
list but i recommend who is from the

00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:28,230
command line whoo okay Nick ftp is a ftp

00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:33,720
client does anyone know what ftp yeah

00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:35,310
it's a bit time no but it's a you know

00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,109
there's a lot of GUI ftp clients

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:40,190
nowadays but Nick ftp has been around

00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:43,410
for a long time two minutes thank you

00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:46,080
and by default if you've ever used just

00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:48,869
a bare metal or just a bare simple FTP

00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,940
you always have to nowadays you have to

00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:53,430
say passive because if you don't is

00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:57,000
going to try to do commands across one

00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:59,220
port and downloads across another port

00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,250
so if you don't do the passive command

00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,180
to to send it you're not going to be

00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,849
able to do your

00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:09,540
all copies so passive has been by

00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:13,109
default in Nick f2p for years been for

00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:15,839
some reason the default in ftp is it

00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:19,050
assumes a ski don't know why but it does

00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:23,160
binary by default it also does m get the

00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:26,010
the normal get command in a traditional

00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,750
ftp program it's just to get one file if

00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,819
you want to do multiple files it will

00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:33,030
get that first file and rename it the

00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:34,790
second file name that you do em get will

00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:38,040
also understand thank you one minute

00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:40,349
will also understand wild cards and that

00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,510
sort of thing it has a history it has

00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:49,140
tab completion and has bookmarks for

00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:50,640
this place yeah dude it's another cool

00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,510
thing that's what's cool let's go

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:56,760
Electric Sheep is pretty cool yeah bash

00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:58,290
bash is my scripting language of by

00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,150
default it's my default scripting

00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,369
language see if I ever get on floss

01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:04,079
weekly with Randall report and he asked

01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:06,030
me what is my editor it's going to be

01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,880
them and what is my scripting language

01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:11,849
is going to be bash it's your shell but

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,819
it's it's my scripting language by

01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:17,220
default so whenever I write a script

01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:20,599
bash with the dash x 30 seconds yeah

01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:25,079
will will print out your script each

01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:26,339
program each line that you're doing one

01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,470
of the cool things that have been added

01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:30,390
just a couple years ago is bash can

01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:31,770
please the best completion you know when

01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,690
you're at the command line you hit tab

01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,309
and it fills out to a certain place well

01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:37,440
it only does that for files but bash

01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:40,770
completion will do that for commands

01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:44,640
that like in apps get you want to

01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:46,290
install you type I in the tab so alright

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,880
I'm going to stop because that's that's

01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,890
my time thank you so much for coming

01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,369
nine o'clock on sunday morning I really

01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,369
appreciate it

01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,950
your customers rely on your website or

01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,319
application if it's slower

01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:40,260
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:42,089
and costs you money keeping your

01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,580
business critical systems humming along

01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:48,430
requires insight into what they're doing

01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,410
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:52,900
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:54,970
resource limitations and other problems

01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,770
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:59,350
your systems performance metrics in

01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:02,200
real-time and record this data for later

01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:04,180
analysis enter longview the new way to

01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,220
see what's really going on under the

01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:08,350
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,330
visualize the status of all your systems

01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:13,060
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:16,180
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:18,640
memory swap processes load and network

01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:21,220
usage click a specific system to access

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,230
its individual dashboard then click and

01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:26,230
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:28,210
more detail comprehensive network data

01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:30,910
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:32,500
is available on the network tab and disk

01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:34,390
rights and free space on the disk

01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:37,240
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:39,790
displays usage statistics for individual

01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,950
processes the system info tab shows

01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:44,200
listening services active connections

01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:46,330
and available updates adding long view

01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,040
to a system is easy just click the

01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:50,170
button copy the one line installation

01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:52,600
command then run the command on your

01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:54,310
linux system to complete the process the

01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,500
agent will begin collecting data and

01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:58,350
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,900
start rolling

01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:03,270
used longview to gain visibility into

01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:07,010
your servers so when your website or app

01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:07,010
