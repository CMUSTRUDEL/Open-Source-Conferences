the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189
the 2014 southeast linux fest in

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,710
pc org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,880
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,189
videos possible okay so thank you

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,250
everybody for making it to a early day

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:36,000
early timeslot talk I appreciate that

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,680
preciate your attendance so I'm actually

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,090
going to go ahead and I'm going to do

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,329
something as an introduction and then

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,910
I'll come and do my introduction so part

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,190
of our themes here is the talk is

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,950
promoting literacy so we're going to

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,079
have our reading rainbow moment and i'm

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,870
going to read about two pages out of

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,789
this book called the superman to get our

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,520
imagination work and get our minds eye

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,329
working to see where we need to go with

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,760
this okay and i got here at like 130

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,159
last night from a layover detroit so

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,119
hopefully I'm hopefully I'm with it so

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,890
just bear with me for six days you

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,659
sicced whole way to have a slide on this

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,560
let's try again there we go that's the

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,740
visual for this story okay try it for

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,799
six days you 66 poked and prodded the

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,850
gray water of the Atlantic Ocean

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,400
frantically searching for a place to

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,890
surface but the ships were always there

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,500
at any time of day or night the planes

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,290
and ships would close in and the crew of

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,229
the u-boat would flee for their lives

00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,360
hoping to find a safe haven now they

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,869
were surfacing again and Capitan

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,360
lieutenant Gerard see Hassan the u-boats

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,090
commander would have preferred to come

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,850
up at another time and another place but

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,890
he was running out of options here in

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,610
the mid-atlantic on the moonlit night of

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,869
May 5th 1944 u-boat life was dangerous

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:07,290
but this was incredible every place you

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,170
66 went it was hounded it could barely

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,660
surface without being stalked time was

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,080
running out c hall since you both could

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,880
go

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,700
further without running its power

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,760
generators which provided electricity

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,760
and light and needed to rendezvous the

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,650
refueling ship with his u-boat at the

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,690
water's surface off the Cape Verde

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,420
Islands see Hassan quickly sent a

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,520
message to the radio room the radio

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,910
operator typed a message into a machine

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,000
called enigma which scrambled its text

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,910
then he broadcast it to Berlin tapping

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,280
out Morse code refueling impossible

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,010
under constant stalking mid-atlantic

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,200
worse in the Bay of Biscay the message

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,610
included the subs location standard

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,120
practice for all German u-boat

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,100
transmissions see Hassan never worried

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,410
that the Allied forces would intercept

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,260
his message and crack the code during

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,530
his hour at the water's surface if they

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,980
found him as he knew they might it would

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:12,390
be by some means other and cracking the

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,410
code never by cracking the code no one

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,680
could crack the German Enigma that

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,540
quickly minutes after you 66 surface

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,970
somewhere near the African coast a

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,700
teletype clattered to life in a

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,000
washington DC laboratory the machine

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,760
rattled away sending two labs operators

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,610
into a frenzy one grabbed the teletype

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,250
paper output and frantically keyed in a

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,080
message and two punched paper tape

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,980
another fit tape into a seven-foot high

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,870
five thousand-pound calculating machine

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,720
inside the machine primitive logic

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,110
circuits examine you 66 message outside

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,590
the labs codebreakers anxiously awaited

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,750
its response see Hassan could never have

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,200
imagined the scenario taking place

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,840
halfway around the world to think that

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,150
someone was intercepting his message

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,459
than sending it across the Atlantic

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,140
where a 5,000 pound machine was

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,049
stripping away its encryption codes

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,620
would have been beyond the bounds of the

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,720
most dedicated science fiction fans for

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,150
that matter the activity in the

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,680
Washington DC laboratory was beyond the

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:27,380
imaginative scope of almost every US gov

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,910
official other than President Roosevelt

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,500
few new of the effort mundanely titled

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,440
communications supplementary activity

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,740
Washington the decryption activity was

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,530
cloaked by such secrecy that its highest

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,410
ranking officials required ultra secret

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,259
clearance a security level even higher

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,660
than that of the Manhattan Project now

00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,600
the machines were cracking you 66

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,750
message and it was about time since

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,389
early in the war you 66 had done more

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,759
than its share of damage american

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:05,240
intelligence blamed it for sinking the

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,090
alan jackson of 435 foot oil tanker done

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,150
by Standard Oil of New Jersey they also

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:15,259
blamed it for sinking the lady Hawkins

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,289
an ocean liner with 212 passengers on

00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:21,789
board mostly civilians including women

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:24,380
and children many sinkings were ugly

00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:27,259
victims swam through thick black smoke

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,510
and layers of floating fuel often

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:32,510
burning to death after the fuel was

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,060
ignited by signal flares but the tables

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,010
were turning the cryptologist of the

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,340
Nebraska Avenue lab cracked the code of

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,289
the U 66 message refueling impossible

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,039
under constant stalking mid-atlantic

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,590
worse than the Bay of Biscay then came

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,949
the most important information 17

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,020
degrees 17 minutes north 32 degrees 29

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,180
minutes west and through a series of

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,849
channels the cryptologists relayed their

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,440
information to the destroyer USS Buckley

00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:04,039
which steamed through the mid-atlantic

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,110
towards see Haasan's you boo see Hassan

00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,900
suspected that it was only a matter of

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,820
time before the allied carriers

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,580
destroyers found him they had been

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,180
hounding him since April 29 and it was

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,120
nearly midnight of May 5th now he could

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,060
see the USS Buckley about 2,500 yards

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,159
away it was far too late to dive an

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,169
emergency dive would take as long as 20

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,900
minutes he would have to face the

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,050
Buckley and he knew he had no chance of

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,659
surviving see Hassan would never know

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,020
the truth about his sub sinking he would

00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:39,419
never hear about the red

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,759
building clacking cracking the Enigma

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:45,539
code he would never suspect that his

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,849
subs real nemesis was an ancestor of a

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:51,210
machine that would one day be called a

00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:54,750
digital computer we'll come back to that

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,819
story these pictures here so the one on

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,280
the destroyer that's the USS Buckley

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,889
that was the the one that we read about

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,830
and then on the bottom picture one of

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,319
those two subs actually is the you 66

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,680
and then the other picture that is not a

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,949
replica that is an actual piece of the

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,539
machine that was used in the story they

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:18,870
called them their code name on both

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:21,240
sides Atlantic for the encryption

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,380
breaking machines with bombs and they

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,430
spelled it differently but one of the

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,229
reasons why they picked that name is

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,610
because if you actually read some papers

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,860
overheard someone talking about the

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,770
bombs you would probably think something

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,710
else so we'll come back to the story so

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,949
Who am I my name is Thomas Dover and I

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,909
am a senior software engineer so that's

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:44,400
my day job is in development but I am a

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:47,069
huge fan of history of all kinds and

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,449
then out of that you have the neish of

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,280
computer history which is fascinating

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,039
and then out of that there's a further

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,949
you know near that damn or to even

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,610
security-related context of computer

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,719
history so that's why that's why I'm

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,819
here today try something a little bit

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,500
different so normally i do technical

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,229
talks in fact on sunday again you talk

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:12,360
on Erlang and finished it please kind of

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:16,409
check that out so when we say computer

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,490
security and within this context I'm

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,349
going to narrow that down a little bit

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,779
and help give some some scope of what it

00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:25,050
is we're trying to accomplish here with

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,000
our narrative the first area of God is

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,130
the concept with security of protection

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,719
from each other you can say criminal

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,690
behaviour know some steals your credit

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,930
card spies on you whatever these are

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,829
these are essentially criminal actions

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,930
since you're trying to track you from

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:41,279
the other areas that we you know

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,510
protection from our leaders the way we

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,250
think of thermally gets the most

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,070
attention current events ones lately

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,380
other than that is the civil liberties

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,530
notions the idea of

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:56,250
what degree of freedom should we have to

00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:00,210
be able to control systems ourselves and

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,830
then we also the concept of protection

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,630
of our civilization military science

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,870
doesn't the story we just read now what

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,370
I would like to get everyone to

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,580
contemplate is that it that these are

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,890
very interrelated concepts and once you

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,280
start trying to analyze one or the other

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:19,230
they they intertwine and they depend on

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,000
each other they're very hard to separate

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,030
these out from but the technical

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:32,100
perspective and from political and

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:34,320
historical perspectives so okay so what

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,480
do we mean by security you know and in

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,610
this context we will use nature's

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,010
definition which means the capacity for

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,180
violence to defend against violence you

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,590
know whether that means you know okay

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,910
the police are going to get you if

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,960
you're still my credit card too you know

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:53,040
we have the potential to conduct a war

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,190
against you so the espionage and

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,740
sabotage or some areas we mentioned our

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,450
story the other ones that that are also

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,460
related that I again we're trying to get

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,920
hopefully to think about things in a new

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,350
perspective to gain some different way

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,960
of looking at things is that there's a

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,510
whole category of weapons that you can

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,980
make when you with one of the components

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:20,760
is a computer excuse me like a guided

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,280
missile drone things like this and the

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,570
other area we'll talk about is once you

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,130
have computers there's other things that

00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,990
you can make but don't they're not

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,010
comprising computers but you have to

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,690
have a computer to be able to do them in

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,870
the first place and that gives some

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,850
fascinating things so okay we'll

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,820
continue our crypto analysis thenahms

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,490
start with so in the story which we were

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,710
reading these are the Germans had the

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,920
the famous Enigma machine these this is

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,660
a some actual recovered ones they were

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,200
all over the place throughout the war

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,540
they had many different generations of

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,590
the technology we're not going to

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,690
exhaustively talk about this because

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,400
this is a pretty popular story but if

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,300
you've never read about dating and they

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,000
please do it's fascinating story and

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,120
then the other one that so I gave this

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,220
talk actually last week in Austin at

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,530
Texas on request and I got some very

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,890
good questions and feedback so I'm gonna

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:20,520
try to incorporate some more of that as

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,250
we go forward because we actually have

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,680
plenty of time and this was at under

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,990
rated the amount of material yet so what

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,300
I wanted to mention with this is that

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,020
you know the the Americans actually did

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,370
have an unbreakable code system

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,400
unbreakable is in it wasn't broken

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,170
during the duration of the war and that

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,600
in the Pacific Theater where they used a

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,490
system of coded messages they came up

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,470
with code words but then they said those

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,410
code words and the Navajo Indian

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,090
language and the difference between the

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,800
Navajo Indian language and Japanese was

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,510
sufficiently different to where they

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,700
weren't able to break that in the time

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,440
frame and so one of the things that's

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,960
that's fascinating to me about is again

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,610
you have this that's another theme in a

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,000
larger narrative of the human mind

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:09,300
versus the computer of the man versus

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,700
the mechanical and what its superior so

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,310
something that is seemingly as

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,220
inefficient as or assuming his primitive

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,290
is it human language she was actually

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,530
more effective than all this stuff so

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,720
the other other thing I point out there

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,470
is that I will come we'll come back to

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,770
that this is a replica it was it was

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,010
rebuilt by hobbyists of what gets more

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:37,140
attention than some of the more famous

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,690
machines that they had on in England

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,160
this was at Bletchley Park we are

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,070
probably more books there's probably

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,760
more movies and stories about the effort

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:51,060
over there that was used to not just as

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,190
a precursor to automatic crypto analysis

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,410
but also of these significance of using

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,450
computers in a war effort this is where

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,160
Laden's comes from now

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,010
one of the reasons when people say well

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,180
why you know this was the stuff is

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,620
almost 70 years ago what does this still

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,960
matter and a bit of course it matters i

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,430
had to some of the younger people in the

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,830
audience i came to talk to them

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,900
literally and i think that that was hard

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,300
to impress upon the concept that this

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,610
stuff is still happening constantly it's

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,950
just that they're not going to tell you

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,830
about it right so this because of the

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,600
age of this stuff besides the fact that

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,130
it's interesting is it the dawn of the

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,140
creation of these things it's also

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,540
interesting that we actually most the

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,870
story is most never know the full story

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,890
is in the public eye we can we know what

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,350
happened whereas the things that

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,120
happened now you know you have to see

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,150
100 years from now from they tell you

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,430
exactly everything that's been happening

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:51,060
ok so the principal figure in the

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:55,560
Bletchley Park side of the story is this

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:58,080
man Alan Turing who is famous for many

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,030
reasons when I was finding these

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,160
pictures on Wikipedia I've noticed that

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:05,340
they're actually making another Alan

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,060
Turing movie in Britain that should come

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,770
out this year that's his that's one of

00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,770
the statues of him an a as an apple in

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:16,950
his hand a lot of people don't know that

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:20,670
he was fascinated and really obsessed

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:23,220
with Snow White the story the poison

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,530
apple and when he was when he was found

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,840
dead he there was an apple with a bite

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,480
out of it and he did died of cyanide

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,670
poisoning but more specifically it was

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,950
cyanide gas poisoning so the Apple

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,350
itself was not a sign I delivery

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,110
mechanism but we do not know if he was

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,460
killed or if he committed suicide or if

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,480
it was an accident those are all

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,770
considered equal possibilities so we

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,820
famously get the term the Turing machine

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:54,750
from his name and where that came from

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,480
is early on in his career after early in

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,280
his a academic career he published a

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,440
paper and what he was trying to

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,990
accomplish as he was trying to explore

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,060
some new ideas some new techniques for

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,700
his theories and crypto analysis and as

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,399
part of explaining that over to the side

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,100
he came up with a hypothetical machine

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,270
that you could you could understand how

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,399
you would go about solving problems in

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,070
that machine he never referred to it as

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,850
a Turing machine that was a term that we

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,370
did his peers use later on and we still

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,390
have that today he was it was a person

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,250
the idea was that you could take a

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,620
person you can set them down and you

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,240
could have sheets of paper and you could

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,680
have unlimited sheets of paper and you

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,959
can have a system for instructions of

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,450
what what procedures did work on the

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,880
paper and you could go to other pieces

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,920
of paper you can reference them and you

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,589
could modify the instructions that were

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,390
on the paper and so by using this system

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,459
there was all sorts of things that you

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,680
can he was to say imagine if we

00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:57,529
obviously automated this somehow but in

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,330
his model it was just a person so that's

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:02,360
where we get the phrase Turing computer

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,440
and and that's all I Turing so we can we

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,899
can come back and talk more about that

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,790
we want to so the book that I was

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,790
reading from earlier is called a

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,790
Superman and this one is although it

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:18,010
does talk a little bit about the the

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:22,490
English side this is mostly about the

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:26,380
Cold War era crypto analysis technology

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,779
with Seymour Cray and so Seymour Cray

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,930
wasn't was a brilliant person on par

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:35,480
with Turing he invented a number of

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,220
things one of which was the idea of

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,529
being some of the very first computers

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,779
that use transistors but he was able to

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:44,450
take the quality for the transistors at

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,310
the time was so poor that you really

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,470
couldn't build a computer with them yet

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,959
and he was able to come up with designs

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,980
to where you could put them in parallel

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,910
make networks of transistors to make

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,940
quality enough systems to where you

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:02,170
could actually deliver things and he by

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,030
hand created these things so the other

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:08,660
idea here is that at the same time

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,199
period you had multiple parallel efforts

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,490
to develop

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,870
years and in some cases they knew or

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,269
aware of each other in some cases by

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,439
design there was some separation this

00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:26,159
sort of branch of this is comes from the

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:30,269
the Naval Intelligence side of the story

00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:31,919
and is the origins of the NSA that we

00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:36,360
think of today comes from this book this

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:39,419
is a great one and it talks about or is

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,269
on the on the English side of the story

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:45,029
the the thought process was more to we

00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:48,600
need to keep a lid on this keep things

00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:51,149
more secret to have more security

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,110
through keeping it an unknown whereas on

00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:57,149
the American side there was a theme of

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,429
well number one we're we are trying to

00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:02,429
roll back our military spending we had

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:04,620
to find some way to continue this and to

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,539
continue this sustainably we're going to

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,880
an effort to tour to bring this private

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:12,149
sector wise also to leverage the

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,820
industrial power that you could be

00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:17,580
gained by using computer technology in

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,120
the West so that was that narrative this

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,940
is a picture of him Seymour Cray and the

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,059
Cray one computer and museum again this

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,590
was all wired by hand which is

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,870
fascinating and he and he would do it he

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,360
was get to the soldering iron and go

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,789
right to it these particular computers

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,929
are what we would now today call vector

00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:44,490
processors or single instruction

00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:46,260
multiple data style computers or severe

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,350
so much what you use in a graphics card

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,789
GPU processor the way they actually

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,070
worked is you actually have a completely

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:54,510
separate computer that would stand by

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,309
next to it that would do the i/o and

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,549
load the program and do control and

00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,049
stuff like that so this was if you

00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:04,289
wanted to see you know the state of the

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:08,190
arc for state-sponsored crypt analysis

00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:11,030
efforts and say throughout the 60s 70s

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,950
and then further this was this

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,990
this lineage of Technology and ideas

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,240
still continues with us today so some of

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:21,740
the largest farms that we have of

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,290
servers is actually just this kind of

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,650
thing we their architecture continued at

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,910
least eight ideas now we use regular

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,310
commodity hardware but some of the

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,890
principles and designs are the same a

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:36,530
lot of times when you see these stories

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,170
of such a such nation has the world's

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,310
largest supercomputer anything you know

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,500
can well besides the fact to the

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,840
prestige standpoint you know what is the

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,280
practical value and the or wise wise

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,000
this at least getting state-sponsored

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,580
money and the publicly stated reason is

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,870
we're doing simulations of nuclear

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:59,000
weapons let's just no doubt true but I

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,280
think we can all use our imagination and

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,530
probably concede that with the flip of a

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,540
switch right you can take this farm and

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:10,010
use it to brute force use decryption

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,380
that would be a much more practical

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,610
value that they would paste before so

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,210
you get a remembering a lot of our one

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,200
of our algorithms that we have they say

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,460
you know it's not that they're in

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,730
breakable it's just that it would say

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,930
they take 100 years or 200 years with a

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:30,740
pc to to crack it but let's say you had

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:32,150
100,000 computers who has that okay so

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,670
yeah clearing that narrative so if

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,440
you've never heard of this story is

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,470
another good one to go research and look

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,710
at there's this you know now the whole

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,510
idea of like export restrictions on

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,920
cryptographic technologies I mean that's

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,020
a mute point whenever even talk about

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,720
anymore but to go back a little bit

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,150
further you know before we we had things

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,120
like RSA and the stuff the big one that

00:20:53,150 --> 00:21:00,580
people wanted was there was a concept

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,230
that you needed a hardware accelerated

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,210
cryptographic routine ship that called

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,980
us the Clipper Chip and the reason why

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,970
this was got so much attention as I was

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:14,960
press as it came from the factory with a

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:18,380
back door put in there by the NSA and so

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,690
early 90s that was the big debate about

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,860
this is going to be the future of of

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,720
encryption in

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,150
computers all the war on the world was

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,380
will have this but there's by design and

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,740
knowingly consciously there will always

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,900
be his back door and you know it didn't

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,520
obviously work out but especially think

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,679
about and one reason why it's

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:42,530
fascinating that the doors were left

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,500
open so to speak is we think what yes

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,480
will we were able to open source it

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,420
we're trying to find ways around it but

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,890
the other reason is probably could just

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,020
as easily be that there are ways of

00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,010
defeating RSA and stuff that we just

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,460
don't know maybe they're not going to

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,400
tell you about it right okay so coming

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,040
forward so are the next concept is like

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,809
said arms that you could make with a

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,220
component of the weapon itself as a

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:13,100
computer so current events wise we get a

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:16,280
lot of talk about drone destroy that you

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,900
know is this acceptable and the law

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,360
enforcement capacity to what extent

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,210
should is be used in battlefield so and

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,460
so forth and we think of these things

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,380
not really is computer security issues

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,580
but I think that we should this another

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,650
is obviously more the story but there's

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:35,299
some overlap there and you obviously

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,059
would not be able to do these things

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,040
without the without the computer so you

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:43,100
should consider that a component of it

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,690
so what I mean by that is if you look at

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,340
the way we're looking at our timelines

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,190
here which I think what would be the

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:52,150
earliest example that we can think of an

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,710
automated weapon system of some kind so

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:58,580
skipping further back before computers

00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,500
this man Nikola Tesla as the book I had

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,370
where this one and I need to find which

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,770
one I read put that up here but he is a

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,660
whole subculture about him is never read

00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,000
much about him he's a fascinating figure

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,440
2 he's the one we have responsible for

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,870
reason why we have lights and this

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,220
building and worked where they do and

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,140
one of the things he he actually had

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,830
examples of was remote-controlled robots

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,780
and he made a proposal to the Navy this

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,590
is early 1900s where you could actually

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:30,919
have warships remotely controlled to off

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:33,289
the coast and Kristen missing

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,320
magic and that scheme is the computer

00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:38,210
itself so you go a little bit forward

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,399
it's all right well what would what is

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,859
probably the or at least the accepted

00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,210
answer for what is the first

00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:48,710
computerized weapon system of some kind

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:53,239
and what you get is this project called

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:55,720
sage and so this is pre-internet pre

00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:59,090
ARPANET but this is a network

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,210
computerized missile and air defense

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:06,619
system that was fully operational in the

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:10,249
mid-1950s and what you had is a there

00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:14,269
were over 200 installations of automated

00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:17,330
radar facilities with a network of

00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:19,850
operator facilities and in some cases

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:23,059
you actually had interfaces directly to

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,009
weapons assets so it's not quite as war

00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,450
games as you think because when you look

00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:27,950
the details of what they meant by

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,299
interfacing with weapon systems it would

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,739
literally it would just print out

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,690
something on a teletype than a person

00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:34,220
would take it and then go over and you

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,519
know launch or whatever so it's not

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,070
quite full blown Skynet yet but that's

00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,989
where we get the the first of that and

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,299
the actual network behind this that's

00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:48,139
another theme is if you have these

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:50,809
contain parallel networks was end use at

00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:51,950
least up until the mid-1980s they

00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:53,269
probably obviously still have their own

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,210
separate network of some kind but the

00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:57,739
actual underlying components of it and a

00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,419
trivia question it's you get from this

00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:01,399
is this is actually pretty as being the

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:03,980
biggest computer ever built biggest in

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,929
terms of physical size because it

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,440
actually took hundreds of buildings all

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:11,539
over the place so the other thing that

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,739
you have there that intersects with this

00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:18,799
is the the network and so we we like to

00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:23,090
think of communication network as being

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,679
a gift of the computer or and that is

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,989
true in the sense that it makes it more

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:28,879
accessible and can grow more but it's

00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:31,249
not true in the sense that that was the

00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:32,450
origin so another book I'd like to

00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,330
recommend this is not necessarily

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:39,499
security related although it does we do

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:42,529
see a the initial discussion Renaissance

00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:43,660
of encryption for communication in the

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:47,020
early days of the tell

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,610
f network but oh it's um it's worth

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,370
considering that you know well over a

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:53,950
hundred years ago you had true global

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,970
real-time communication and this is in

00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,190
the hands of the powerful and we so the

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,200
idea of this disseminating into more and

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,660
more people is just a continued theme

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,220
that dates back this early so you know

00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,540
we still have what two billion people on

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,610
earth that don't have internet access so

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,410
it's not this narrative still continues

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,820
and yes we can do things that we can do

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,230
before because computers and you can

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,420
make them cheaper and faster better but

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:20,920
the concept of the network itself

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:23,800
predates that if you're interested in

00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,140
the early network or early internet era

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,850
a couple more books that are not

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,620
exclusively about it but they touch on

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,780
it I've read one of them is a

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,120
fascinating one in general about the

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,340
Xerox PARC story but they in the early

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,220
parts I kind of explain where some of

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,230
the money and where some of the

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:44,740
characters originated from in that story

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,200
then other one is by Serbia ornstein is

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,510
kind of just his tale of being a you

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,540
know hacker in the trenches from this

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:55,300
time period and he goes some information

00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,550
I'd never heard before about University

00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,140
of Hawaii some of their network models

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,710
and stuff that work relationship of

00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:05,560
great books so okay moving on a little

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,820
bit more so then we have you know okay

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,620
now that you have computers what are

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,480
some things that you can make that you

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,220
otherwise wouldn't be able to so the big

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:22,480
one that gets the most attention is the

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:24,610
hydrogen bomb so it is conceivable that

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,350
this could be done without agent puters

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,720
but certainly on the time frame that we

00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,950
had and it probably are you could make a

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,550
case that we would have never been able

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:35,710
to create hydrogen bomb without a

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,750
computer-assisted computational

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:41,020
processing so the computers that had

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,700
their this is in Los Alamos this is

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,590
course this is after you know the atomic

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,630
bomb this is later on this is another

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,370
generation throat forward these were

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,280
still not fully complete turing machines

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,900
yet but they you could prove you program

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,100
them the cables that you see on the wall

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,070
there that's actually how you would

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,940
reprogram you

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:01,309
to physically rearrange patch panels but

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,940
you could you could do things much more

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:08,240
faster than you otherwise would so the

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:11,440
principal figure behind being able to

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,309
make the the first fully electronic

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,460
Turing complete machine is this man von

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:21,529
Oy Minh John even women and he was also

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,730
had it not been for him not only would

00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:26,179
you not have that but she would not have

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,820
had the hydrogen bomb even though we

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:32,570
think of that as narrative with

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:37,399
Oppenheimer and those people it never

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:38,659
seemed to tell William Tell the you

00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,759
wouldnt have had a computer without him

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:43,850
and so if you get anything from this

00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:47,299
talk it's please go read this book i was

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:50,059
at Northwest linux fest a couple years

00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:52,279
ago and George Dyson who wrote this book

00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,970
lived in bellingham washington and he

00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,049
was on the last leg of his book tour and

00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,899
he had spent ten years of his life

00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:02,299
making this book and he goes deep it

00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:05,299
does goes into the basements of places

00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:08,210
and finds records that have been lost

00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:11,750
and been forgotten and he contests a lot

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:14,000
of accepted narratives of where some of

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,240
these things came from but the story

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,649
that he puts together is fascinating

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,230
with a lot of different characters a lot

00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:23,899
different reasons but he also tributes

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,000
he really tells us to read if avanos and

00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:28,549
what we had to thank him for and his

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,120
model is you have the the old testament

00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:34,580
of computing the prophet being this man

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,340
named live-ins as a contemporary Sir

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,529
Isaac Newton who we credit today with

00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,870
things like the way in our arithmetic

00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:44,860
logic unit works

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,320
he rediscovered binary arithmetic

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:52,309
fascinating person he as a philosopher

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,410
he had the he's credited with amazing

00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:58,100
notion that God created the best

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,930
possible universe which by definition if

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,450
he's God he would have created as most

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:05,420
which is fascinating concept and then

00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:08,630
the New Testament prophet is Alan Turing

00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,800
and the figure in the middle is why

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:14,690
anointment so the book is really about

00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:17,690
Long Island and it explains that he was

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,670
the right person at the right time with

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,020
the right connections to make this

00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,860
happen and had the war not been going on

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,100
this probably would not have happened

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,679
and another interesting thing about him

00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,170
is that we're in the Institute that was

00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,000
it was paying where he worked mostly he

00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,010
had a lot of Einstein worked there for

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,800
example but these people out of them

00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:43,179
were pacifists and in this which is fine

00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:46,850
but he was quite adamant that he was

00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:50,030
specifically trying to kill Nazis he was

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:52,610
immigrant he escaped from a hungry and

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,710
you know he said look these that killed

00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,720
my whole family he tried to join the

00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,580
army when he got here they told me was

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,730
too old and fascinating so oh yes so the

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,610
other thing about him is that in his

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:12,320
model it wasn't you know the weapon

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:15,350
right was was not the hydrogen bomb the

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,290
weapon was the computer so if you think

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:21,110
about you know what is the most amazing

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,350
or significant or dangerous thing that

00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:26,120
you can build once you have a computer

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,640
more computers and that was a large

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,250
thought up with his ideas his teaching

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,200
some ideas was that you can have

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,100
successive generations of computers and

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,059
they were already at the point where

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,610
they were doing that they were using

00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:41,620
primitive computers to simulate model

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:47,980
and design newer computers okay so

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:50,150
moving to our civil liberties concept

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,980
there's a question you know re all right

00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,090
so this we think all these horrible

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,880
things that can happen

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,790
when you have this power right so you

00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,980
know what what happens when evil people

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:05,270
at least things right and the question

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:08,690
that comes up in a kind of a debate

00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,310
class style is I is just precisely that

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,990
someone asked William Buckley one time

00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:14,510
they said you know what would happen can

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,890
you imagine if the Nazis had had the

00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,030
computer first or if they'd have to

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,520
configure at all you know how much more

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,020
efficient would they be in their aims

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,060
what would think of the horrors that

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,890
they could have accomplished and he said

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,720
well you know that's not an argument

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,960
against technology that's an argument

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,420
against Nazis which is simple but it's

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,010
interesting to contemplate but what a

00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,650
lot of people don't realize is that the

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,740
Nazis actually did have the very first

00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,120
Terran complete computer this man if I'm

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,400
told the way you pronounce his name is

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,240
Zeus it's pronounced it's written like

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,910
Zeus but Conrad Zaius is actually

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,970
credited with the first fully complete

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,590
Turing machine this is a replica of it

00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:58,940
in Germany and that's a picture of a

00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:01,130
statute now the difference here is that

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,050
this is made of relays so you're talking

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,730
about an electromechanical system so

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,860
you're still talking about 12 or three

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,780
orders of magnitude slower than the

00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,780
fully electronic systems which are made

00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:15,050
with vacuum tubes so what happened to

00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,150
this where did this go well Hitler

00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:21,830
actually directed it the more the money

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:25,580
go to the v2 projects and for a while

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,900
there this was kind of lost so it's easy

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,370
to just kind of imagine though in an

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,680
alternative timeline you know when you

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,840
have things like this there was the

00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,160
rocket there was Heisenberg who almost

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,730
had the bomb first things could've been

00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,730
quite different

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,850
so then I'll take to the last slide than

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,200
I have some other comments is that

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,660
relating it back to this conference is

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,840
that it is very important to maintain

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,420
control of your devices or at least the

00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,480
ability to do so we we take so many

00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,310
things for granted as far as firmware or

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,760
what may or may not be written in

00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,590
microcode and was very hard to say to

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,770
what degree of control we actually do

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:11,890
have of our computers that we use and I

00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:14,410
think that one of the things one of the

00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:16,540
perspectives I'd like to present to you

00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:19,180
is the notion that you should we should

00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,980
treat computers with the same kind of

00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,770
respond to dove respected retrieve

00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:27,160
firearms and that we also treat larger

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,870
weapon systems that they are potentially

00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,420
that deadly but they're also critical

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:36,010
for the balance of power and especially

00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:38,380
in the context of a Western or American

00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,730
ideas about that this is something that

00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,110
we all have and that's something that we

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,180
should maintain and so if you look at

00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,860
say von omens model if you know what

00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,120
what was more powerful what was more

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,160
dangerous with a hydrogen bomb of the

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,660
computer you know the computer we're not

00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,850
allowed to invite him mom's we can all

00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:54,070
have computers who really controls these

00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,110
things who is it it's you know do you

00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:00,160
have the ability to do it as you want do

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:02,170
you trust it and ultimately no but you

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,430
can get closer in that direction with

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,050
free software it is a very big deal so

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,780
this is the last of slides ID so now I'm

00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,760
going to touch recap some things that it

00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,710
came up and questions and comments that

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,300
we had so one that I actually haven't

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,180
gotten chessa updated slides this week

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,610
yet I will before I turn them in so you

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,690
can have the reading list we had someone

00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,930
from the audience that's em they

00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,490
recommended a great book called IBM and

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:31,150
the Holocaust which I can't say anything

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:33,670
about but evidently this was about some

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:37,540
of the census machines that were made

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,610
and it sounds as bad as it

00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,470
as the title gives it so we that's a

00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:44,280
limb to check out the other one another

00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:48,460
discussion that came up about this was

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,870
the notion of you had these peoples I

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,160
should like we talked about Heisenberg

00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:58,420
and some others who we recognize in zoos

00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,370
as we recognize them for their their

00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,920
fame for what it is they did but we look

00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,350
at you know who they were and we don't

00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,310
we somehow kind of skip the judgment of

00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:10,840
their character and so just if it

00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,900
applies on this is just remember that

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,570
the seduction of Technology and

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,880
seduction of power it's easy to get

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:22,870
sucked in and to think and so just we

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,880
have a conscience have have have a frame

00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,980
of right and wrong so what is you're

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,890
working for and what it is that you were

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,460
trying to do it and then the other theme

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:35,470
i'd like to point out i came up with my

00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,080
son he's third grade and we're learning

00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,610
math homework right and you'd like

00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,720
everyone you know why do I have to do

00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,170
this Mike you're learning to check with

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,840
the calculator and it regained the

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:49,180
narrative of who's in charge who is the

00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,390
master of who you know to what degree of

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:56,710
trust do you have in that calculator and

00:36:51,390 --> 00:37:01,600
again you know we are so i would say

00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:02,980
that in a way is that while we so like

00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,510
if you look at if you looked at some of

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,100
these systems and you looked at me watch

00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,730
twilight zone ii watch the way that

00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,470
people used to view things the it was

00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,560
not about the people behind them the

00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:18,580
fear was the actual technology itself

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,780
and so we have come a ways and our

00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,940
understanding and our perception these

00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,490
things till we still view computers and

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,160
technologies inanimate objects and we at

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,870
least have enough maturity with it to

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,900
look at well it's the person behind

00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,880
these things but we are still sort of

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,550
conditioned to feel that these things

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,609
are non biased that's that's where i'm

00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,670
getting at these

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:41,960
not necessarily so we may be an

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,489
inanimate object and maybe a person

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,980
minded but you need to still question

00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:51,920
don't still don't necessarily trust the

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:54,319
wizard of oz at face value and so with

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,809
that I will I will take if M is any

00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:03,619
questions or i can continue to to ramble

00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:05,680
so well okay well appreciate your time

00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:08,630
and your attention i will put these

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,309
alpha t slides up on the website you get

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:13,910
the links for the books and i will be

00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:16,579
around for until sunday Stephanie I

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:30,349
would like to talk about this thank you

00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:32,450
very much your customers rely on your

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,819
website or application if it's slower

00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:37,730
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:39,589
and costs you money keeping your

00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,079
business critical systems humming along

00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:45,900
requires insight into what they're doing

00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,910
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,160
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:52,469
resource limitations and other problems

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,269
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:56,849
your systems performance metrics in

00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:59,700
real-time and record this data for later

00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:01,680
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,690
see what's really going on under the

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,819
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,829
visualize the status of all your systems

00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:10,559
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:13,680
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,140
memory swap processes load and network

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,719
usage click a specific system to access

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,700
its individual dashboard then click and

00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,700
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,709
more detail comprehensive network data

00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,410
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:29,969
is available on the network tab and disk

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,890
rights and free space on the disk

00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:34,739
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:37,259
displays usage statistics for individual

00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,450
processes the system info tab shows

00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:41,700
listening services active connections

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,829
and available updates adding long view

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,509
to a system is easy just click the

00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:47,670
button copy the one line installation

00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:50,099
command then run the command on your

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,809
linux system to complete the process the

00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,999
agent will begin collecting data and

00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:55,850
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,400
start rolling

00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,770
use longview to gain visibility into

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,510
your servers so when your website or app

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,510
heats up it stays up

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,730
