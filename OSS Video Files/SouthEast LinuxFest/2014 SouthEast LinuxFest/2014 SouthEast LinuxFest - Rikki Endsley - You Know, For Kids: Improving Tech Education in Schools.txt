00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,730
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,789
videos possible okay thank you all for

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,260
coming to my talk today I this is what

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,350
I'm talking about I hope you're in the

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,780
right room talking about high school

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,840
tech education first a little bit about

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,660
my background I started working and tech

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,730
publishing about well detection company

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,160
about 17 years ago about 15 years ago I

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,309
started working at sysadmin magazine and

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,039
right now I'm but community community

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,539
evangelist for red hat the upstream

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,270
projects the open source and standards

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,329
team but before this my career had all

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,489
been in tech publishing and so I wasn't

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,290
directly involved in a specific open

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,159
source community but I've done a lot of

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,500
observing community and covering women

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,100
and tuck topics education how we can get

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,540
more diversity in tag meanwhile I was

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,000
busy raising a child and also some a

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,020
single mother and that was 17 years ago

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,110
she's a out of high school now and so

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,490
this is an experience that we had with

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,960
high school programming class her one

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,960
and only high school programming class

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,229
so my daughter's entire life I have been

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,060
working in this field and when I did my

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,850
thesis online master's degree a few

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,090
years ago I actually covered topics

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,210
involving you know women in tech and

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,840
I've covered mentoring quite a bit and

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,149
you know spend a lot of time thinking

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,329
about how we can increase diversity for

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,130
me and I really do think it starts back

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,540
at education early education you know

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,460
and until we start fixing things there

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,930
it's not going to get better later so

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,969
anyway I'm not saying that I'm the

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,799
perfect mom or anything I didn't win any

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,899
awards for parenting and this experience

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,599
is based on one personal experience one

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,760
mom one kid and but I think it's really

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,560
helpful when we talk about you know

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,150
improving diversity or

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,830
education or anything that we have real

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,720
examples otherwise people don't really

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,099
relate so with with my child and I did

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,110
all the things that we are told or best

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,580
practices for you know increasing

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,640
diversity make sure they have mentors

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,209
and role models and access to technology

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,130
so that's why I provide this background

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,569
to let you know that she technically

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,580
would be considered privileged as far as

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,950
having you know all these things that

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,470
should have made her first experience

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,140
with a programming class a wonderful

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,870
experience that we all think big kids

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,069
should be having you know that's not

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,549
what happened and this is going to be

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,540
the story about what happened so first

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,100
let me tell you a bit about my child

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,170
this is not her she actually doesn't

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,450
like it that her mother is a writer and

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,730
talks about her so I'll try to keep her

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,080
name out of it and minimize you know her

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,690
too much except for the shared

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,040
experience we had with this class and

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,250
she just got back from India a few weeks

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,989
ago she's 17 almost 18 she graduated

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,269
from high school two years early she

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,590
skipped sixth grade I skipped her over

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,950
sixth grade to put her into a private

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,329
school because she was um bored you know

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,440
kind of annoying the teachers because

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,420
she thought she was smarter than them

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,390
and so I put her in a private school

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,100
where and she was challenged a lot more

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,799
and it was a better situation for her at

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,690
the time and then she wanted to go back

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,450
to public school for her sophomore year

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,980
and so I did that and and that was nice

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,769
i lived in Lawrence Kansas and we had a

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,870
real good school system and they had a

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,130
nice selection of classes and that's

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,340
what she wanted was more choices for

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,579
classes and then her junior year which

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,859
would been not this school year but the

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,239
one before and she decided that she was

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,889
going to go to India and study abroad

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,600
and that meant she was going to put

00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,730
Oliver senior level classes her second

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,930
semester of her junior year and she did

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:07,579
it and that's how she end up graduating

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:10,530
early I'm in going off to India so she

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,819
despite being raised by mother who you

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,370
know spent all these years telling her

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,560
how wonderful I T is an open source and

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,570
in fact for 16th birthday she asked for

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,269
a Mac because she was sick of being a

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,710
beta tester all these years you know and

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,630
and for her that was like you know

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,410
rebelling I guess I don't want to run

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,990
linux I want a mac

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,450
anyway so she wasn't you know she wasn't

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,800
dying to take a programming class she

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,820
had just you know I had encouraged her

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,130
all these years and I really thought

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,180
she'd be good at it because she's very

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,920
creative and also very get it you know

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,620
black and white thinking also and so I

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,580
thought that's a nice combination for

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,630
computer science I thought she'd really

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,000
enjoy it but she she wasn't eager to

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,290
take it in fact her awards were you'll

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,840
be happy i signed up for a programming

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,370
class you know and i was happy and she

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,050
did it not because she really wanted to

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,640
but if it well with her schedule you

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,240
know and so she thought she'd give it a

00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,710
try so she didn't she wasn't like a kid

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,910
whose spirit got broken and that's why I

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,160
give you this background here it's not

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,230
that she thought she'd go in and try a

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,390
programming class and see how it goes i

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,100
think we see that a lot you know with

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,780
kids and if it's not a positive

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,780
experience we can lose them right away

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,930
so I was real excited about it you know

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,250
and so I had visions of this class where

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,590
the kids had gathered around the robots

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,360
you know and or they build you know

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,910
we're about out of Legos or they would

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,540
program our a raspberry pi or you know

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,730
and learn how to make him computer games

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,919
online you know or build a website or

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,270
make a mobile app he know and so I was

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
throwing all these ideas I'm like oh

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,340
this could be so good I can't wait to

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,070
hear what you're doing that'll be fun

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,990
and do it together you know and and so

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,620
she gets home the first day and I was

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:54,080
like so what are you doing um she's like

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,910
well I'm the only girl in class and I

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,140
had never occurred to me that she'd be

00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,310
the only girl in class and I should have

00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,930
thought that you know I mean I've been

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,360
the only woman at many things in my

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,290
career and and the other thing was I was

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,720
like well what are you learning she's a

00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,460
visual basic I was like let me google

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,780
that and you know because I've only

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,310
worked in open source my whole career

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,510
and so I wasn't even really sure what

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,960
she was talking about and then I was

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:17,600
like visual basic and that's just not

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,870
like a super in demand you know language

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,930
or it didn't sound fun you know I just

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,280
and also I've am I thought having been a

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,419
single mom I mean I need a lot of people

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,770
who didn't have a lot of money I didn't

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,630
have a lot of money as a single mom and

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,890
that seemed like something that kids can

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,660
really access if they weren't in the

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,520
classroom necessarily he know where as

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,789
if you're doing programming in the cloud

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,569
or you know you can go to a library and

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,839
log in and work on your stuff you

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,789
our two friends house or whatever anyway

00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,059
so I was like okay maybe this will be

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:50,639
all right so then I asked her why aren't

00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:52,740
there any other girls in your class and

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,990
she said well I know my friends it even

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,309
heard of the class so you know her

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,569
friends didn't have a mom and I'm going

00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:01,050
oh do this it'll be fun you know

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,610
probably and I'm like I said my daughter

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,749
took the class just because it fit in

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,919
her schedule it wasn't something that

00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,939
had been you know promoted a school or

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,379
she didn't hear the friends talking

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,289
about how cool this class was or

00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,209
anything in any case and she at first

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,399
issue she didn't might be an ally Gronk

00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,229
us at all she liked the guys you know

00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,930
and and it was fun the banter and

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:25,259
whatever and and and she was having a

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,759
good time and so that was great she came

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,589
home with some fun stories about class

00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,699
you know the banter not necessarily what

00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,139
they're working on I never wants her

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,639
what they were working on it was easy

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,849
and she was done with it very quickly

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,899
you know and so she you know I was like

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,729
what do you do in class and she's like

00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,399
might get done early and I'll read a

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,080
book or work on another homework or if

00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,789
somebody miss class you know I'll help

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,229
them or if they're stuck I'll help them

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:51,569
and so you know she's buzzing along in

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:55,199
the semester getting an easy a you know

00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:57,329
not real excited it's not you know she

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,189
definitely did not get some passion

00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:00,930
sparked in this class or anything but it

00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:05,779
was not a horrible class either at that

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:08,550
point well so I am like I said she was a

00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:11,610
teenager at this point and it was her

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,869
junior / senior year and she was about

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,779
ready to head off to India for almost a

00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:17,909
year and so we had an agreement that

00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,769
school year that she could stay home

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,269
alone why I traveled for business you

00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,219
know and I am I had other people that

00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,300
would check in but she didn't she didn't

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,430
have parties or anything I wasn't

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,169
worried about it right and so I I was

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,269
often a business trip when I first heard

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:33,180
about this harassment that was happening

00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:35,669
in in the classroom and I was at

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,699
supercomputing in Salt Lake City a

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:42,149
couple years ago and and i think it was

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:43,829
early November so she called me and i

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,660
was at the booth i was working with

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:48,300
usenix at the time as their community

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,010
manager and an editor and so I'm I took

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,019
the call on the show floor he know and

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,350
she's like mom I have a problem and I

00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,520
was like

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,080
she's coming to me with a problem which

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,790
she also never really did you know she

00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,460
was very good at solving her own things

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,820
and she said the guys in class are all

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,350
harassing me now and I was like really

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,630
and that was just so weird you know they

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,870
all had turned on her and she's like I

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,490
don't know what to do about it and she

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,200
said they they keep saying things like

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:18,240
em whoops what the wrong way sorry um

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,620
they keep saying things like get in the

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,490
kitchen and make me a sandwich and I

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,080
just remember feeling sick in my stomach

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,960
when she told me that because the one

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,570
time I have been horribly harassed in my

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,920
in my career was when I said that I was

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,950
a due tomm we don't cook I was trying to

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,140
be funny but it was I also kind of make

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,510
me sick in my stomach and a few years

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,910
ago when I worked at Linux new media I

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,960
had a blog called the Rose blog and it

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,170
was Ricky's open source whatever I don't

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,340
remember us but it was a blog to

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,660
highlight women and open source and what

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,400
I wanted to do is not talk about the

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,020
problems that we were having necessarily

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,520
with diversity or whatever but I really

00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,100
wanted to focus on what women were doing

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,770
in open source and stories they had with

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,150
the projects they were working on or

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,630
calls for papers because I wanted to see

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,010
more diversity you know in events and I

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,950
had written a blog post one day that

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,260
made some guys mad on 4chan and so they

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,430
started leaving horrible comments well

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,590
they started the very first one was

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,330
given kitchen make me sandwich I have no

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,120
idea what why that does the first insult

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,460
they got thrown out in both of our cases

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,530
is very weird them anyway they started

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,700
you know harassed me on the comments and

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,850
then I was started getting personal

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,900
emails you know and and i found the chat

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,200
room that they were all you know

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,580
planning this barrage of online

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,920
harassment so i just turned off the

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,470
comments on our website you know they

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,730
had to be approved after that and they

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,980
weren't because they were lewd but

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,310
anyway it was it made me sick at my

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,220
stomach because i thought just had never

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:52,020
occurred to me that harassment started

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,970
back then he now like i could understand

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,540
it not being a courage started at high

00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:02,730
school and and i had spent you know all

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:05,630
these years coaching my daughter on you

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,130
know why program

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,480
would be good regardless of your career

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,010
or having some understanding of how

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,080
technology works will help you in any

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,640
career that you have and that sort of

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,620
thing and I just never even thought what

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,090
are people on there boys you know

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,200
because I didn't have a boy had a girl

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,580
and so that was what came to my mind is

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,260
what are these parents I mean I've been

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,880
that they aren't even telling their boys

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:30,050
anything about this unless their parents

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:34,520
are an IT maybe you know so um you know

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:36,440
she was like what do I do and I was like

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,390
let me get back to you on that I didn't

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,220
know I mean I know what to do in my

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,170
career and I've coached women how to

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,360
handle harassment their jobs you know

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,400
but high school you can pay me to go

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,600
back there it's not fun you know and I

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,190
don't want to scare anybody here but

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,010
it's it's not something that you really

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,210
want to redo right and what how you

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,680
would handle stuff in high school is not

00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,560
hopefully how you'd handle it as an

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,230
adult and so I'm I said let me let me

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,990
check with some people and I know a lot

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,960
of women in the field also who are

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,720
programmers and you know in fact one of

00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,370
the people I reached out to she's she

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,050
contributes to the linux kernel you know

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,020
and then her husband as a high school

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,300
teacher and so I reached out to them and

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,630
a couple other women to get you know

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,510
their feedback and so I went back to her

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,070
and I said you know I talked to these

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,660
friends and they had some suggestions

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,180
you know you did the right thing by

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,320
coming to me and she you know I said if

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,300
you want I can go and talk to the

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,440
teacher if you want I can come and talk

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,850
to the class and I'll bring some free

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,190
magazines and books to hand out you know

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,560
some type of stuff and and talk about

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,820
careers and stuff and I'll slide in the

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,860
harassment thing and they won't know

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,130
that you know and maybe it'll be cool

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,950
that I can slide that in and then I was

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,950
like war i could have a some guy in town

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,470
a developer from lawrence come and talk

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,540
to the class because Lawrence has a

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,990
really nice tech community at to college

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,210
town and them all the men I knew in

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,580
Lawrence who worked in IT were also very

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,320
interested in mentoring and helping kids

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,060
you know and so that any of them would

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,680
have been happy to do this and so I

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,180
presented everything to her and she was

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,010
like okay let me think about it and

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,660
ultimately I did feel like this was her

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,980
decision she's I'm preparing to send her

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,900
off into the world and if she can't

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,430
handle you know making decisions in this

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,680
one cloud

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,300
were both in trouble and so I did let

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,470
her think about it so in this situation

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,279
how do you think she should have handled

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:35,440
this I think they have suggestions on

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:41,260
what you would tell your kid or no I'll

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,330
tell you how she handled it the the

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,860
first thing she did which i think is the

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,839
right thing to do is she spoke directly

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,080
to the kids and asked him to stop and

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,010
and you know was very firm about it she

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
didn't joke around she's like it's

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,740
harassment it's not fun it's not cool

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,440
whatever and that did not work and so

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,360
the next thing she did was she told a

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,260
parent which I also think was a good

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,750
logical second step for her and you know

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,820
and i gave her a bunch of ideas and did

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,170
what I could had she been younger I

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,850
would have gone directly to the teacher

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,290
I would have been there you know and in

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,730
fact the year before I would have done

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,670
that but like I said this was her last

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,990
year before going into the world so our

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,640
deal was if i don't hear from your

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,100
teachers they won't hear from me without

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,230
your permission you know and she was

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,279
doing well so they weren't hearing for

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,410
me so the next thing she did and was she

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,240
she talked to the teacher about it again

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,029
i totally think she did the right thing

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,209
here I would have I would have thought

00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,529
that was perfectly logical next step and

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,750
she even told the teacher that she would

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:47,830
be happy because my daughter's she uh

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,480
she's 510 and she's a confident you know

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,560
smart woman so she was like I'll get in

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,810
front of the class and talk to them

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,390
about harassment and and the lack of

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,620
diversity ite you know and and I was

00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,000
like okay that was cool I wouldn't have

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,260
thought of that adds you know that was

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,079
very cool the thing to suggest and so um

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,510
yeah the next thing was she got called

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,040
in the principal's office and I didn't

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,480
know this until after she graduate from

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,750
high school she didn't tell me this part

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,230
until later because she got called into

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,870
the principal's office and she wasn't in

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,220
trouble necessarily but that she felt

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,620
that way that you know the principal

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,480
said that it wasn't her place to get in

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,730
front of the class you know and

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,490
um and address the class and that sort

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,500
of thing so at this point you know I was

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,149
I was really surprised to find us out

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,260
after the fact that she had been call

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,940
him in the principal's office and at

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,160
that point nobody had ever contacted me

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,589
even if the person is a senior at that

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,699
point if a harassment is so severe that

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,889
they're getting called into the

00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:50,019
principal's office mind you my kid not

00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:51,750
the harasser has my the one getting her

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,070
ass guy called in the principal's office

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,380
and all this is very interesting to me

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,300
now because we also see this as women in

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,269
tech this is one of the issues with

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,889
women who report harassment and it's

00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,540
very risky and scary to do that because

00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:06,190
often it's the person who reports that

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,959
has a fallout and not the people who are

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:12,130
doing harassing and when I say that I

00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,839
need to put an asterisk there and say

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,260
and this isn't a horrible field to work

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,050
in this does happen and it but overall

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:24,040
you know it's a wonderful field to work

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:25,839
in but harassment is still an issue so

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,790
the school what do they do about the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,130
harassment absolutely nothing I heard

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,529
nothing from them she saw no improvement

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,060
in class you know she went ahead and

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,290
finished she only had a few weeks left

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,380
until you know the end of the semester

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,639
which was in she was going to be taking

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,290
another programming class after this

00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,290
because it had not been a fun exciting

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,459
class obviously and and um there was no

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,290
incentive for her to take another

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:49,240
programming class after this and I

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:54,399
didn't hear from the teachers or

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:57,730
anything so she graduates and goes off

00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:01,589
to India less last summer and and that

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,540
was the end of it and then I was at work

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:08,770
sometime last fall I think and whenever

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:12,880
the techcrunch they had a conference and

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,189
in it it made the news because there was

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,679
people going up on stage and presenting

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,540
their mobile apps they had developed and

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
it wasn't just adults and there were

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,350
kids there who had made some cool mobile

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,910
apps including a young girl who made a

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,490
mobile app and I think what it did was

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,750
it helped arrange playdates with friends

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,230
you know and it was so it's kind of cool

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:35,470
and but unfortunately she got to go

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,179
onstage after I guess too while a man

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,299
and then a couple of guys had presented

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,480
their apps and they were really stupid I

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,429
mean they were lewd

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,020
so if you know one was a I believe it

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,820
was called tit stare and it was

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,770
basically an Instagram but it was for

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,860
taking photos of women's chests and

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,390
posting you know and why anybody would

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,640
have thought that was clever or worth

00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,900
getting presenting on stage as beyond me

00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,790
but somebody thought that was a good

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,290
idea i guess but imagine this girl's

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,270
parents as they're sitting there you

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,580
know going my kids following that how

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:09,350
mortifying you know so i read that

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,850
online one morning and was a livid and i

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,520
was like done angry blog dunning reblog

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,020
you know and so I because I've been

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,580
writing for a long time and I have a

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,720
good policy about not angry blogging and

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,799
I was like go to the gym so I went to

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,309
the gym and I got home and I was still

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,410
mad I mean reblogged but because i have

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,049
been doing this for a long time and it

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,370
was very articulate you know and I was

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,950
you know I wasn't just going to write a

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:34,429
rant I wanted to have an argument in

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:37,610
there and so I was like I told my kids

00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:39,260
story in this blog post and and it

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,270
wasn't just a rant like i said i had i

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,290
provided seven tips for what this

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,880
teacher could have done that would have

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,190
made this experience much better when it

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,600
cost any money or much time and and this

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:52,070
could have been a good experience for a

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,870
girl or a minority student you know or a

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,280
particularly shy student or a student

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,360
with disabilities somebody who would

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:03,830
have been the other in class you know

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:06,169
well shortly after that I found out that

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,700
it that everybody was reading my article

00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,830
like suddenly people my family knew what

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,450
I did for a living you know and they'd

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,890
never known before you know and my

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,690
cousin who's a teacher was like oh my

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,410
god you're a writer you know because she

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,760
read this and so this the only article

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,650
I've ever written that made me cry and

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,270
it was because I was like oh my god my

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,309
daughter is going to kill me I feel like

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,290
I said she doesn't she doesn't want me

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,360
acknowledging that you know she that I

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,080
have a child at all in anything i right

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,860
and so that was the thing that was most

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,230
stressful to me and so just unread it

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,270
you know it had this was just one of the

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,820
places that got posted on reddit and it

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,200
was on a bunch of other slides hacker

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,450
news i think it made the homepage of our

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,850
hacker news and and you know i was

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,320
getting calls from the folks at used

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,640
Nick's going on why didn't you tell us

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,260
you were going to get all this traffic

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,090
we would have done stuff

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,370
because the servers were freaking out

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,980
and I said what I told you I brought a

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,330
post it might get red you know I thought

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,010
if a few extra people would read it I

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,870
had no idea it was gonna be such a big

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,460
deal and and I had you know I've written

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,050
articles over the years i've been very

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,790
proud of that i spent you know week of

00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,070
research you know and this was something

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,540
i knocked out in 45 minutes and as I of

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,370
course it's the thing that's most read

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,900
and my entire career you know but people

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,400
could relate to it you know and and

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,430
people felt things teachers were

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,590
emailing me and and students you know in

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:31,190
college students and you know parents

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:32,510
were emailing me so here I'll present

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,130
the seven suggestions I have for

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,350
teaching high school programming and

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,740
mind you I'm one mom with one kid I'm

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,770
not an educator you know but I was like

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,350
from my experience with my kid this is

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:46,850
the feedback I would have given you so

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,020
the first one was recruit students to

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,040
take your class because I like I said

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,390
Mike had said none of her friends had

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,970
heard of the class nobody knew about it

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,650
you know and this would be a situation

00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,540
you know as a teacher where it wouldn't

00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,130
be hard to you know go and tell other

00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,660
teachers you know over coffee or

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,800
whatever can you let you know the

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,480
students in your class know about this

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,770
programming class or maybe can I come in

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,690
and have five minutes the beginning of

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,980
class you know to let them know when

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,870
they're signing up for class is why they

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,510
might want to take my class you know and

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,310
maybe tell them about some you know cool

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,230
careers you can do and this is a good

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,210
jumping-off point or how there's a lot

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:23,240
of demand for programmers whatever make

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,530
some effort you know to actually promote

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,970
to promote the class as an option and

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:32,090
the second one was to set the tone from

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,740
the first day of class you know I think

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,440
you know setting the tone from very

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,240
beginning this is a positive

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,470
collaborative atmosphere apparently not

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,290
with visual basic but have they been

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,250
teaching an open-source programming

00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,840
language you know they could have said

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,820
open source is very collaborative and

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,750
and so I'm you know people should be

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:53,920
friendly and working together and polite

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,060
and you know that sort of thing and

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,000
outline explained enough force and

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,610
anti-harassment policy and I personally

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,370
don't know how effective those are about

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,050
in high school situations you know

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,460
bullying is a huge issue and so this

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,020
would not be so crazy to put

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,080
in high school class you know talk about

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,210
harassment and particularly since it

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,809
does start back there and that it is a

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,390
big issue in tech he know we have a very

00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,580
small percentage of diversity and women

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,140
and so this is a still a hot topic and

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,429
this would be a good thing to introduce

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,020
to the class and just have zero

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,250
tolerance which I don't know why they

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,570
don't i'm a kind of thought everybody

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,100
did in high school anyway with bullying

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,520
you know that's such an issue now but

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:38,000
not in the 70s my grew up then you were

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:43,070
supposed to get all you then um don't be

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,690
boring um I you know and programming to

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,039
me is like Shakespeare philosophy if

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,200
you're sitting in class in your bored

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,360
it's the teachers doing it wrong you

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,220
know and I dropped a philosophy class in

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,690
college because I was it the first 30

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,159
minutes like I can't stay awake and this

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,299
is not how philosophies supposed to be

00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:57,980
at supposed to eat you know really

00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:01,039
exciting and that's a program you should

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,010
be and if it's a boring class you're

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,020
doing your own and then pay attention if

00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,850
you know that you have em and other in

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,580
your classroom you know one kid that

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:13,640
standing out as not fitting in you know

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,039
like the only girl or the only exchange

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,510
student or you know whatever and make

00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,429
sure you're paying attention and the

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,870
first day class might the teacher said

00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:22,250
to my kid I'm you know I'm really sorry

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,590
you're the only girl in class so he was

00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,909
aware from the beginning that and said

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,520
it in front of all the other kids you

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,840
know that that she stood out as being

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,500
different than all the other kids in

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,299
class and then throughout the semester

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,669
check-in what he didn't have to check in

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:39,289
my daughter was tying him during the

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:41,120
semester that big kids are harassing her

00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:42,770
but you know with other students not

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,570
everyone's going to go and report you

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,950
know harassment or that the class sucks

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,460
or anything and so it's good to check in

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,950
with the students and then finally am

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,730
follow up after the semester you know if

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,610
you're trying to create a good

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,080
atmosphere make sure that you have they

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,390
do this in college generally that you

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,980
have that you can evaluate your teachers

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,990
you know and the and the content and

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,309
it's anonymous and I don't know why you

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,350
wouldn't want to do that to improve your

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,330
class you know and none of this cost

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,039
anything that I was suggesting none of

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,679
it was hugely time-consuming that this

00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:13,880
was you know these were my suggestions I

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,179
whip together and throughout in this

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,830
article well like i said i didn't i

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:20,090
didn't know that so many people read the

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,659
article i thought you know we'd have

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,340
300 page views or something and said the

00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:26,929
comments started rolling in and because

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm a professional I don't read comments

00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:32,900
just don't it's a it's a horrible thing

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,000
to do I did have to read all the ones

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,220
that came into our website because we

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,620
did not allow anonymous comments or

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,850
uncivil comments on the usenix blogs and

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,020
so I had to read them and approve them

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,750
and out of all of those there was only

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,730
one I did not approve and it was a guy

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,049
who was claiming to have tracked down

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,150
where my child went to school and had

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,630
called you know and talk to the

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:56,179
principal and I don't believe in any of

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,399
that was true but whether or not it was

00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:03,140
it was creepy and so that was the one I

00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:04,880
did not approve so I'm I'll show you

00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,250
some of the comments that came in

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,840
because when I proposed this talk I said

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,100
and if it's accepted I'll go look at

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,919
some of the comments and show them to

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,820
you because and here's an interesting

00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:20,659
thing when when you work in in tech and

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,690
and you write about these issues you

00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,429
know of diversity or harassment or any a

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,440
bad and it doesn't matter how you write

00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,809
about it how nice you are professional

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,250
or what your outlet is and it causes

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,260
some kind of aurora and you'll get a

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,559
bunch of backlash on it and I see this

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,450
often so this was one person suggestion

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,669
to what I should have taught my daughter

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:45,350
to do was to hit the guys that were

00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:48,140
harassing her which um I taught her how

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,429
to defend herself but um I had never

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,690
encouraged her to hit someone if she I'm

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,010
like what they were saying you know it

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,850
was more physical you know somebody

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,220
attacks you here's a maneuver that's it

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,690
so I thought that was bad idea and

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,220
here's another brilliant suggestion that

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,500
rolled in why didn't I call the parents

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,020
of all the kids can you imagine the

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,309
horror if your mother called and you

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,770
know your junior senior year of high

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:12,529
school and called your son is harassing

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,970
my kid she would you know wouldn't fixed

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,440
anything for sure and I want to be able

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,470
to go home my kid would have killed me

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,529
so that was a dumb idea somebody

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,940
suggested I got lots of this this is so

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,520
close to my own experiences it's painful

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,289
I got that from women who are in the

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,960
field and I got it from a lot of college

00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:32,210
students who were studying tech I mean

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,309
people who got past this anyway and

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,200
dealt with it

00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:40,570
get it through high school and went on

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,519
hmm and this was another one I should

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,870
talk to the teacher and like I said had

00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:47,049
she been younger I would have talked to

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:49,210
the teacher but if you're about to sing

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:50,350
your kid out into the world call me old

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,210
school but I think your kids should be

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,830
able to make it through the high school

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,049
you know and be able to learn how to

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,429
fight their own battles at that point I

00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,539
certainly would have gone in and talked

00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,519
to the teacher had that been want my

00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:02,379
child wanted me to do but you know she

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,289
felt like she had handled it on it her

00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:06,610
own and so when I wrote this and I

00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,779
didn't I still didn't go talk to the

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,279
teacher I don't the teachers probably

00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:10,779
perfectly nice person he's probably a

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,980
good teacher I don't know you know maybe

00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,419
this is the class he doesn't want to

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,429
teach and he gets forced to teach that

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:17,289
happens a lot I had a football coach who

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:19,869
taught my history class it was helpful

00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,970
you know but and he was probably a nice

00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:24,580
guy he know but so I bet I thought you

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,289
know I I not everybody has a platform

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,610
like I'm able to and I thought I'm gonna

00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:29,369
write about this this is something I've

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,659
been passionate out for a long time and

00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm going to share this experience and

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,990
so it was much more important to me to

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,499
get it out there than to go talk to one

00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:40,539
teacher so you have more than two

00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:43,330
thousand comments on you know one link

00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:45,690
alone and then more than 100 I think

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:48,279
came in through to the Houston site but

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,419
somebody and I actually a lot of people

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,070
i think thought it was man writing the

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,230
article which I you know my name is

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,090
Ricky so I wasn't offended you know that

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,179
happens a lot anyway I get mr. Inslee

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,279
all the time got it last week and but I

00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,320
do also think that and not as many women

00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,820
might have the platform I have to be

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,019
able to write online so that's also part

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,639
of the assumption probably that goes

00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:12,039
into it and then here's you know that it

00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:13,480
devolves into generic advice for

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,950
teachers from a non teacher who still

00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,350
thinks he has the right to explain how

00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,789
to do your job well as a parent you do

00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,759
have every right to go in and talk to

00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:23,289
teacher you know and tell them and I my

00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,809
daughter had had a math teacher and

00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:27,490
junior high who and she was having some

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,659
issues and she was very good at math but

00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,450
she was having issues with this one

00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,740
class and he had me come in and when I

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,269
told him well this is how she learns

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,009
best he thanked me and was happy you

00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:37,389
know because that he was like now that I

00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:39,970
know that I'll be able to you know help

00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:44,039
her with this you know she learns better

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,480
this way so this was also bad advice

00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,039
doesn't paint an empathetic picture when

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,590
it goes to great lengths to first state

00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,200
how insanely privileged the daughter is

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:55,509
that was the point you know my aunt and

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,669
she was privileged and that's why i am

00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,619
the article i gave my background that I

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,090
worked in tech that my daughter you know

00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:03,009
for spring break got to go to drupalcon

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,909
because I was a single mom and I was

00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:05,139
like hey guess what you get to go to

00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,049
Colorado for spring break because I'm

00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:09,970
working you know and she's been to a

00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,529
federated conferences week because she

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,139
was on summer vacation and I was working

00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:16,239
he now and she's she went to AWS con

00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:17,950
because I was working and I was AK you

00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,749
get to go to Portland you know you can

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,999
check out colleges so yeah she was

00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:24,850
privileged that was the point and not

00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:27,220
most single girl going into a classroom

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,989
full of boys are going to have the kind

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,450
of encouragement you know in background

00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:35,320
in access to technology that she's

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:38,409
always had oh my dad I felt so bad for

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,809
him and so I went to his house for

00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,100
dinner and he came out and put his hand

00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:44,109
on my shoulder he's like are you okay I

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,119
was like yeah why and he goes that

00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:48,879
article and I said yeah and he was the

00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:52,419
comments I said Oh dad you did not read

00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:54,009
the comments and so he just he felt like

00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,739
I must be devastated and I was like add

00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:57,909
no dad nobody reads comments and so when

00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:59,019
I'm was this lady sounds like a real

00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:01,239
a-hole and this is the kind of stuff

00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,369
that my poor dad was I cannot believe he

00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:05,230
read all this stuff and then I'm the

00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:07,539
tone makes my skin crawl about this

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,999
classic tone argument that you see that

00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,950
you don't you were don't see it if one

00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:13,809
men right you never see someone saying I

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,940
didn't like his tone you know and

00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:17,679
doesn't matter how snarky or sarcastic

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,039
he might be but you see it with women

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,659
and I'm snarky and sarcastic and all the

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,059
time and talking it so I really reeled

00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:27,489
it in for this article you know and it

00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:32,019
wasn't that bad but it made someone's

00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:33,190
skin crawl um yeah and I feel like a

00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:34,779
good point might have been made if the

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,129
author wasn't so obsessed with her and

00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:38,470
her daughter's resume for half the

00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:39,879
article again I felt like that was

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,489
important to provide that background and

00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:44,320
if she were best if I hadn't beat up the

00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:46,539
visual basic people really wanted to

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,919
defend it you know and there weren't a

00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:49,179
lot of there weren't a lot of them but

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,649
the people who wanted a Senate were very

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,019
passionate about it and in hindsight I

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:55,299
went way too easy on it you know I am I

00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:56,740
barely mentioned it in the article and I

00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:58,179
could have devoted many paragraphs

00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,559
how that was the dumbest thing ever that

00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:03,309
you know this was what they were showing

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:07,120
in class and so yeah I went easy on it

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:09,160
and most condescending immature letters

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,440
I've ever stumbled upon that was no it

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,790
wasn't i hoped on if it is you didn't

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,790
get out very much um right I know I was

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,870
like how did you end up on Reddit and

00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:22,150
this was the best one this is my

00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,100
favorite I want to get that on a t-shirt

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:27,160
someday pathetic self aggrandizing

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,510
waffle right is I like that one that was

00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,820
awesome so that was worth reading all

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:37,690
the comments and then somebody wrote

00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:39,070
I'll see you know I already got that

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,390
here's more and whoever wrote this

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,679
should take a slap in the face I learned

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,880
to communicate respectfully with others

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,740
I hope they were trying to be funny cuz

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,880
ya communicate respectfully with others

00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,890
after you slapped me in the face alright

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,510
so yeah somebody else put and talk to

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,860
people in a position to actually do

00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:02,170
something about it like the teacher um

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:06,940
well I did I wrote a blog post about it

00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:11,050
and it it got out there you know I mean

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,580
like I said people who I had known for

00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:16,059
years and years all the sudden knew what

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,800
I did for a living you know and my

00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,420
cousin Nicky that you know high school

00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,850
teacher was like how my god your writer

00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,160
you know and people in my neighborhood

00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,620
who had no idea what I did people my

00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,660
community you know moms in my community

00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,800
that weren't teachers or in tag that

00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,140
were just moms and interested in

00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,450
education for their kids you know we're

00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,040
emailing me and messaging on Facebook my

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,429
oh my gosh I you know I read the circle

00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,200
then realize it was you and so and then

00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:44,740
last weekend actually at texas linux

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,100
fest I had a guy that came up and told

00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,020
me that his college computer science

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,880
professor who was a woman read the whole

00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:55,090
article in front of the whole class you

00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,309
know and so and it I had no idea any of

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:01,390
this was going to happen when I you know

00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:04,000
did my rage blog but and hopefully the

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,010
the one computer science teacher that my

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,980
kid had also read it but in any case

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,750
plenty of other people did

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,910
and then plenty of people have talked

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,510
about it not just with me but with each

00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:17,640
other and in their communities so that's

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,710
our story and that's when I was sharing

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,390
it to let you know that this really

00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:25,710
still happens and we have a long way to

00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:28,470
go to improve diversity here if we're

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:32,370
still having such a problem and turning

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:34,770
off students in school any questions or

00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:48,590
comments I left a little time for

00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:48,590
discussion yes it was out

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,929
I that's like I said I didn't go meet

00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,870
with the teacher I didn't you know and

00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:02,059
so all I know is that's all they did you

00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:06,140
know and that was really surprising to

00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:07,610
me because they're so I mean you know a

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,750
teacher can even phone it in at this

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,429
point when they're all these online

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,679
classes and stuff where kids could

00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:14,240
really tailor their own education in a

00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,310
class you know and I think the teacher

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,690
wouldn't have to do much and each kid

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,250
could be teaching themselves based on

00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,109
their interests you've been you know but

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,270
to have one thing that they do and

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:25,820
they're not getting to create anything

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,500
and it's this basic coding I mean

00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,090
there's so many options now where you

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,460
can learn a program and do something

00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,560
cool in the process you know making you

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,649
end up with a game or a website or a

00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,220
robot you know or any kind of a thing

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:43,580
this was this was how I learned basic

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:48,050
programming 20-some years ago and I was

00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,580
shocked so not useful I you know I don't

00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:53,720
know where she'll ever have a chance to

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:57,970
use that again any other questions you

00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,970
had one right okay

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,030
yeah it's so it's hard to believe I mean

00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:17,840
we're going to be awful behind if that's

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:17,840
how we're teaching computer science yes

00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,370
well I'm I think it should be free

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,870
amantha should be something that kids

00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,910
can access regardless of their income

00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:31,410
and guard lists of whether they have

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,850
internet or a computer at home because a

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,040
lot of kids don't and that's a huge

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,080
assumption if you think that every kid

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,280
has one at home they don't and so it

00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,680
should be something they can go into the

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,880
library not necessarily school you know

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,560
or different house and be able to at

00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,840
least get online you know and there's

00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,520
tons of free stuff online so I don't

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,540
have a particular thing but I mean do

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,430
you think it should be free and

00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,610
something kids can access regardless of

00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,320
their home situation and I think if you

00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,090
really want kids to get into it should

00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,130
be something that they're into and that

00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,680
means there should be some options you

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,000
know because kids don't I don't learn

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,590
the same way other people learn kids

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,230
don't learn the same way and since

00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:09,810
there's so many things you can do I mean

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,730
there's why wouldn't you present a few

00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,990
things in the classroom you know and let

00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,080
somebody you learn how to do a mobile

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,250
app you know who wants to do that and

00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,590
that all the kids are into their phones

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,290
you know or build a website or make a

00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:24,690
game you know I don't I don't see how

00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,240
you'd have to pick one you know because

00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,800
i know i know t i know in high school

00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,300
they have these words standards and all

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,910
that stuff so that is an issue they're

00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,130
going to have to deal with but i think

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,230
you get if you had to do visual basic

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,060
the kids had plenty of time to read and

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,820
be bored also so they could have also

00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,990
been doing this other stuff so that's a

00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,790
non-answer but now i don't have your

00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,170
perfect language i think that there are

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:53,330
many options and you should do whatever

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,330
the kids are into yes no

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
standard

00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:06,440
we just had a workshop on it back

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,740
fruit when you say

00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,400
you might

00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,700
okay i will look into that I hadn't

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,120
heard of it thank you I mean you had

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,120
question

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:45,850
by the way that I can singled out that

00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:45,850
sinker and creatively explain that

00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,619
speaking frankly with these kids I think

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:09,730
it's very important because they need to

00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:11,619
realize right and I do I I do think you

00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,029
know and something should have been done

00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,430
with all the boys and I can't say for

00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:18,460
sure nothing was but my daughter saw no

00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:21,400
change in the class and like I said we

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,990
had an agreement you know being raised

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
by single mom you know I did really

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,930
raise her than pretty independent

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,150
self-sufficient you know and since I was

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,740
sending her to India and I wanted to

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,140
make sure she could fight her own

00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,500
battles and that's why I did not go and

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,970
talk to the teacher you know but she did

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,539
come to me and I was glad I at least

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,539
know about it

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,670
yeah it was a great experience and also

00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,210
and when I wrote this a lot of people

00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:57,310
misunderstood and there are many

00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,480
follow-up articles and you know where

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,540
people link to this and said you know

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,730
that this experience and you know kill

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,290
the girls desire to go into tech or

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,360
whatever and that's not what happened in

00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:12,390
fact and the career she's looking at is

00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:14,260
very tech oriented you know and it's not

00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,520
programming she's looking at something

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,650
something else I want to give away her

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,870
business but it didn't kill a girl's

00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,690
desire it certainly does kind of

00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,100
experience certainly could you know but

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,300
my daughter like I said she's going to

00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,280
do whatever she wants to do and so she

00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,440
made it to the class again a and went on

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:36,360
and did her stuff so I think there's

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,360
nothing yes thank you

00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,990
in

00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:52,569
wire but everybody looks like you

00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:52,569
like

00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,240
right

00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:38,780
thank you I appreciate that yes okay

00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:40,550
thank you okay I'm sorry um well then

00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,380
I'll ask you since you're a teacher how

00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,830
practical or the suggestions i gave as a

00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,830
parent

00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,100
don't

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,670
anymore

00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,840
Wayne call it nurse

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Chris

00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,440
well and you know my article Emma there

00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,420
were some people that were very

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,950
defensive about me bashing teachers but

00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,970
my article certainly didn't and like I

00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,680
said my cousins a teacher and we had

00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:35,360
almost all positive experiences with

00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,850
teachers my kids entire life you know I

00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,990
mean in Lawrence Kansas the teachers I

00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,640
think our exceptional the schools are

00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,190
exceptional that's one of the reasons i

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,230
stayed you know and so I certainly was

00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,820
not bashing on the teacher and like I'm

00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,560
guessing he did not want to be teaching

00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,300
the class you know and I know that

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,710
happens you get stuck in the class and

00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,210
you have that you have to do as opposed

00:41:51,710 --> 00:42:05,570
to it actually being your area you know

00:41:53,210 --> 00:42:07,670
so other questions over here yes okay

00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,500
and he asked if I'd suggestions on how

00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,910
not to be boring well my colleague Ruth

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,460
back there for example and is a

00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,830
Raspberry Pi enthusiast and gave a talk

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,680
here and that's a really simple though

00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:21,110
it was created to help educate you know

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,940
kids in computer science and high school

00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,680
or college I think in particular but and

00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,850
something like that's very fun and

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,720
there's a bazillion things you can do

00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:31,100
with it you know so things like that

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,230
were they I think they have their hands

00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,320
on stuff I'm i have always learned

00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,960
better if i see stuff like if it's i've

00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,520
never been able to teach myself anything

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,830
like programming related by reading it

00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,880
you know or by repeating it and you know

00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:49,550
on paper or repeating it just on the

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,110
screen i have to see it an output like

00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,370
on a website you know that I changed

00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,210
code here and this is what it look like

00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:57,740
over here you know so occasionally you

00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,060
know I I had hoped that she was going to

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,740
one of those cool things like make the

00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,780
robots that move or something you know

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,220
like that because there's a whole lot

00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,280
that goes into it and then you end up

00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,180
with this little cool thing but I just

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,590
don't know how you can make it boring

00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,640
that's the thing I feel like you have to

00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:15,430
go out of your way to make computer

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,430
science boring you know yeah yes

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:29,170
that's what I thought but I never felt

00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:33,270
you a lesson

00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,270
and was

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,090
mm-hmm

00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:54,100
I'm going to teach you about right yeah

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:59,880
and yeah you would it should be very

00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,880
hands-on so yeah yes

00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:13,390
bye absolutely crazy luck but I knew

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:18,609
very little program guide to pass school

00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:20,770
and high school and it was terrible but

00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:23,170
in my career I have quickly realized my

00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:27,050
gosh i need a program so I'm going on

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:31,360
Coursera and signed up for every burger

00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:35,510
and I will say that most of the young

00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:38,480
they were unbelievable but I found one

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:41,270
and the whole reason treatment was done

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,570
by rice university's python programming

00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:46,760
to build games I love puddles and it was

00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:49,400
incredibly challenging it was very

00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,410
collaborative but the point is if you

00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,319
want to make identification not boring

00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,449
make it something that kids

00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:58,089
Frank what kid wants to learn how to

00:44:55,449 --> 00:45:01,209
prep out i'm going to create a python

00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:03,219
program that holds the mix of database

00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:05,289
for a hotel prank boo cares so we must

00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:08,049
do that unless you're deadly program is

00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:10,650
it worse in hotels and let this soon

00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:13,329
have other interests it as a hobby right

00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,819
something there's fun the kids will do

00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:17,109
and you know if you make the class

00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:19,599
challenging enough there's not a time

00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:20,949
for beretta is why frankly I mean

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,380
there's obviously needs to be set down

00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:26,259
in these be set expectations there needs

00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:29,709
to be encouragement from parents frankly

00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:32,589
to have their girls go into IT don't

00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:35,289
hurt my sister through a whole lot of

00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:37,989
that and very fortunately the guys in

00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:42,130
our class on another continent but you

00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:45,009
know it's very challenging to do these

00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,779
things properly and obviously there's a

00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:48,790
lot of teachers

00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:52,730
if they

00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:54,440
well and I grew is you're saying when

00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,720
you said that if they're busy enough

00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,060
there's no time for harassment and I

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,470
have to wonder in hindsight if part of

00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,060
the harassment wasn't because she was

00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,109
very good at it and some you know and

00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:07,220
she was trying to help some of the boys

00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:09,380
and I you know one thing if the kids

00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,390
were working on individualized projects

00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,099
you know that we're catering to their

00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,480
personal interests they wouldn't be

00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:17,030
competing over all doing the exact same

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,859
thing you know in and I i could see kids

00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,150
be more interested in sharing what

00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,920
they're doing and talking about the

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,740
different projects you know because then

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,569
they're learning off each other also I

00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,920
shouldn't I shouldn't go teach some time

00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:32,920
because I think it would be really fun

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,920
you know this is not my area but yeah

00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,540
right now and as I was saying I I would

00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:40,010
I never bashed on high school teachers

00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:42,260
because it is a job that I don't

00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,579
actually want and I never felt qualified

00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,460
to teach my child and that's why I

00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:47,750
didn't homeschooler I thought that you

00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:52,660
know there were people better qualified

00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,660
to be teaching my child you know so yes

00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,180
yeah yeah I mean you can't you can't

00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,420
prevent it if you're going to allow it

00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,640
to grow and go on definitely that's

00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:17,490
you're saying though and there's another

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,490
question yes

00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,250
many many years ago

00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:39,420
there was high school

00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,420
it's more like

00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,599
uh-huh

00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:11,119
hi

00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,119
right

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,160
they didn't have

00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,010
I think we're probably mostly on

00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,670
agreement that our entire education

00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:24,840
system could use a reboot but that was

00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,000
beyond the scope of my one post

00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,730
definitely am but I agree with you that

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,920
I think is ultimately a much better

00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:35,340
system than what we currently have it's

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,690
too little check mark ii you know and

00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,720
kids don't fit like that my daughter

00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:41,040
like I said I had to make changes as to

00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,050
her and switch her to different schools

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,050
based on what her needs were you know

00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:50,190
and because no one school or you know

00:48:46,050 --> 00:49:07,010
curriculum was fitting her so any other

00:48:50,190 --> 00:49:07,010
questions are yes expect were

00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:14,210
and I think that for things like the

00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:14,210
word has BPA

00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:20,240
your role as Microsoft airway password

00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:24,920
once he met and that's right and that's

00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,480
a big assumption there because my

00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,800
daughter we didn't have that at home she

00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,910
had she'd been running linux since

00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:34,010
elementary school and you know and then

00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,960
their dish the kids that don't have or

00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,970
they have it illegally maybe you know

00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,839
but or they just don't have have it at

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,839
home at all so

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,610
well that's where you would be looking

00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:03,430
at it it would be results based you know

00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:05,230
where you you know one idea off the top

00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,270
of my head would be where you know you

00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:09,130
come up with a plan you know like you do

00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,020
in grad school for example for a project

00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,310
or you know thesis you come up with a

00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,480
plan and what the results are going to

00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,920
be and how you're going to get there and

00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,750
that would be a good way I think to

00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,520
teach computer science class to where

00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:21,010
you know kids like I want to do a game

00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,540
that does this and they come up with a

00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:37,120
plan getting the semester and then he's

00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:38,050
graded on I didn't hear the last part ya

00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,390
know but I'm talking about for high

00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,680
school though I mean they're very

00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:44,070
intelligent you know at this point

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,210
anyway by their junior seniors are

00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:48,940
pretty smart and there's plenty of stuff

00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,950
online that is geared to high school

00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,610
students anyway or junior high students

00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:56,740
you know that it's free classes online

00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:59,140
even you know so I think that it's

00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:01,810
doable not maybe not for every school

00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:05,730
you know based on what the rules are you

00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,730
know yes

00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:18,170
logic pseudocode low charts design Orion

00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:20,180
and if that's the case then

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,910
ya like like you said it doesn't matter

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,980
what way would you use here's what you

00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:28,370
have to accomplish how do you brush your

00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:33,250
teeth here's the steps you have to do

00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:33,250
that and that becomes your setup

00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:41,510
first birthing class is way beyond what

00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,510
they mentioned

00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,290
logic

00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:03,600
that's when we were in school they

00:51:54,570 --> 00:52:10,370
didn't you know we had Tony forms and we

00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:10,370
wrote out not actually programming

00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:18,110
to knock

00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,110
I did

00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,070
work

00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:47,109
we have another question over here let's

00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:49,690
yes yeah and that's son and that's it's

00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:51,130
it's unfair to kids who aren't going to

00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,340
be able to afford that kind of stuff and

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:57,840
have it at home you know or be able to

00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,840
access it you know remotely

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,200
right yeah the fonts were always an

00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,340
issue for my child because then she'd

00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,110
get home and not have the funk she

00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,550
wanted and it would it work whatever

00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,140
paper she worked on at school because

00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,350
she came home I news libre office but i

00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:44,570
was like huh didn't have to deal with it

00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:47,410
yes you should each word processing you

00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:50,810
should eat a pro you should eat you

00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:53,000
spreadsheets not instead best lesson fun

00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,740
education system they don't lead to the

00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,450
future as will i have to get your

00:53:54,740 --> 00:54:04,700
welcome you yeah you definitely am you

00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:07,490
are ahead if you're able to quickly

00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,560
adapt to different technologies and

00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,810
that's why i'm just being able to do the

00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:16,300
one thing that you have to own certain

00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,300
things is not going to help you so yes

00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:28,660
I I sort of look at your narrative see

00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,660
that ready on your sort of brass by the

00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,690
my mind it's kind of insane

00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:50,330
but there it seems like you're saying

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:54,370
just a Gorean perfect solution and

00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:54,370
what introduces

00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,490
would it be better

00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,490
try

00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,960
so other people who are trying

00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:13,480
like wide services

00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:13,480
from sometimes it's in here

00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:19,599
well rarely i think is it okay to ignore

00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:24,220
it and I wouldn't say that I ignored it

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:26,049
and the anonymous all and honest people

00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:29,529
who are harassing me online at one time

00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:30,400
and where I found the 4chan room that

00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:33,609
they were doing it in or whatever

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,400
channel and they were all am eagerly

00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:38,229
awaiting my response and I certainly was

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,859
not going to give them that and I did

00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:44,890
respond by going forward all of our

00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:46,960
blogs and posts on any of our English

00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:49,359
sites worldwide you had to have approved

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,489
comments because you know we wanted to

00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:54,670
have a civil professional publications

00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:56,529
and website and so I did have it I did

00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,720
respond there was nothing I could do

00:55:56,529 --> 00:56:01,150
about anonymous people online and it

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,460
would I mean you can I've never seen

00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,809
that turn out well you know they're

00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,809
anonymous I mean they'll create more

00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:09,519
counts or whatever and I don't care

00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:10,930
about them because they're not they're

00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,329
insignificant to me and they weren't

00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:16,029
really going to affect any part of my

00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:18,460
life now had was it a person if it was a

00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:23,170
person a conference you know or in my

00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:24,789
office who was inappropriate I certainly

00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,140
wouldn't ignore that would be face to

00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:27,969
face you know and I and it would be

00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,430
addressed you know and it wouldn't just

00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:31,869
be don't talk to me you know which is

00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:34,029
basically what I did you know by turning

00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:35,529
off the comments but I mean what else

00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:38,170
there was nothing else to do in a

00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:41,349
situation like that mean for Chan you

00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:45,479
know the anonymous people there's what

00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:45,479
can you do so his yes

00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,450
which was turn off so we are a student

00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,369
in the classroom her daughter at very

00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:59,799
well controlled situation to think

00:56:57,369 --> 00:57:02,920
breasts teacher wasn't doing

00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:02,920
students were

00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,930
it's a little different when you're the

00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,930
professional world

00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:14,989
right yeah and you certainly don't want

00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:17,390
it to go on in a situation where someone

00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:20,239
is stuck you know like my kid would have

00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:24,999
been stuck every day you know and was so

00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:24,999
I'm saying back there yes yes you

00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:42,700
I the first thing I know this is Batman

00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:45,190
except the world changes the first thing

00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,320
I found is that I was so getting ready

00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:53,380
for knowing nothing of yours that I wall

00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:57,220
when I came back because of education

00:57:53,380 --> 00:58:00,100
they offer you can get DP download that

00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:02,860
XML I game packaging distribute online

00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:05,530
share with your friends so for a

00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,180
community standpoint focus or playing

00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:10,510
serious attention because I came from

00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:12,430
that I didn't come back to open source I

00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:14,560
find I said I want to you these other

00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:16,570
things how come you know but it wasn't

00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,670
till actually I came to self years ago

00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:22,270
died on open source people who didn't

00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:25,030
really Vidiot because I do much tonight

00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:27,190
but harassment the fractious makes for

00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:29,530
between two communities technologies

00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,630
technology and just because you come

00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:35,020
from one place and come to another it's

00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:37,819
just add hard on somebody to say hey

00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:40,489
your technology don't learn is

00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:43,190
what I am so i just wanted to point that

00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:45,499
outfit if we're teaching technology my

00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:48,289
kids I don't really care what they learn

00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:51,739
as long as they learn love technology

00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:54,289
that makes my life around honey so I

00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:55,999
just want to throw that out there we

00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:58,699
really play catch-up I mean code camps

00:58:55,999 --> 00:59:02,749
for kids I get why my nine-year-old son

00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:04,219
and I am working myself to death trying

00:59:02,749 --> 00:59:06,349
to figure out how to get him to love

00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:07,880
technology these things always starving

00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:10,099
your way up here where target with that

00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,859
and this does is for kids is aligned

00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:16,759
yourself but I wanted to learn both

00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:19,670
sides so I've given things that are at

00:59:16,759 --> 00:59:21,739
Hastings level also source either gear

00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:24,469
so beginner that they're going to form

00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:28,009
tears are so advanced it you know I

00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:30,289
don't know I have to move traffic well

00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:32,630
Emmy yeah I hear what you're saying it's

00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:35,420
fortunately you had em access to the

00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,499
microsoft stuff for free you know

00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,559
because a lot of kids aren't going to

00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:45,920
have that and that's okay it's for

00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:55,809
everybody okay it's not my area of

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:55,809
expertise yeah yeah

01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:48,219
okay we have one minute left so yeah and

01:00:46,479 --> 01:00:50,349
that wasn't it was not the focus of my

01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:54,009
original article you know it was more

01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:55,119
about and accessibility what the kids

01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:58,029
are going to be able to do outside of

01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,499
class also and be interested in you know

01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,929
so but on what you were saying about the

01:00:59,499 --> 01:01:02,979
computer to it's funny I got a electric

01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:04,539
typewriter when I graduate from high

01:01:02,979 --> 01:01:06,099
school as a gift and my first computer

01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:07,479
was when I graduate from college and I

01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:11,769
got through college on the electric

01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:13,689
typewriter so okay all right and that's

01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:14,769
if anybody wants to continue the

01:01:13,689 --> 01:01:16,539
discussion will have to do it i guess

01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:19,059
outside because I'm we're out of time

01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:28,449
and someone else's up I believe thank

01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:30,400
you thank you your customers rely on

01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:32,650
your website or application if it's

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,949
slower non-responsive it infuriates your

01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:37,809
users and costs you money keeping your

01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:41,310
business critical systems humming along

01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:44,130
requires insight into what they're doing

01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:46,140
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,390
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,700
resource limitations and other problems

01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:52,470
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,080
your systems performance metrics in

01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:57,930
real-time and record this data for later

01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,910
analysis enter longview the new way to

01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,920
see what's really going on under the

01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:04,050
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,060
visualize the status of all your systems

01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,790
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:11,910
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:14,370
memory swap processes load and network

01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:16,950
usage click a specific system to access

01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,930
its individual dashboard then click and

01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,930
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,940
more detail comprehensive network data

01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:26,640
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,200
is available on the network tab and disk

01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,120
rights and free space on the disk

01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,970
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:35,490
displays usage statistics for individual

01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:37,680
processes the system info tab shows

01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:39,930

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,060
and available updates adding long view

01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,740
to a system is easy just click the

01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:45,900
button copy the one line installation

01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,330
command then run the command on your

01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,040
linux system to complete the process the

01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:52,230
agent will begin collecting data and

01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:55,740
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:57,990
start rolling use long view to gain

01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:02,750
visibility into your servers so when

01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:02,750
