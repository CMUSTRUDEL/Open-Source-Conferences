the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,250

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,740
like to thank the following diamond

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,010
sponsors in 2014 for helping make these

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,119
videos possible wonderful wonderful okay

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,580
i'll go ahead get start off everyone's

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,240
okay with that so somebody let me know

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,240
when the start

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,120
alright so first and foremost thank you

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:45,110
all for sticking with the conference to

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,550
the very last hours of it somehow or

00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,239
another this happens to me more than I

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,769
care to more than I care to remember so

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,750
i should start indicating that i have a

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,989
time commitment during the last session

00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,339
so I say stop sticking me there but

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,829
thank you all thank you all for coming

00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:02,629
today I'm going to be talking about open

00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,430
source software in the classroom okay

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,710
and as you can see my twitter handle is

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,060
i share our comics but people whenever

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,820
they interact with me in the real world

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:15,619
to refer me as very petty chord the

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,270
third so my background will hopefully

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:19,280
help provide some context for what i'm

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,810
going to be talking about today I'm a

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,720
PhD student at North Carolina State

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,720
University and rotli my research is in

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,380
computer science education specifically

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,420
I'm interested in looking at how people

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,399
acquire and then use programming

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,229
languages so as you can imagine that's

00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,920
very useful to people who teach

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:42,710
technology and in doing so I ended up

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,049
becoming a teacher you know when you're

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,610
in grad school it's not free and they

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,700
you know they pull you around teaching

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,500
to help you pay your own tuition so I've

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,290
been teaching for about two years i

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,850
started off teaching a a junior level

00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,380
software engineering course where we

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,320
teach you know agile software

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,979
development methodology and then this

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,180
most recently last year I taught c and

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,929
software tools so the C programming

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,459
language and all the glory of pointers

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:14,090
hardware memory management that sort of

00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:18,579
thing I have a very diverse background

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,579
both in education and an open source yes

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,410
it's a sophomore level class yeah feel

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,790
free interrupt with questions anytime

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,080
I'm a lot more animated when I'm

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,460
answering questions the question was

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,670
what level is it from master's degree I

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,160
did cyber security research hacked cell

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,060
phones did network analysis it was

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,460
pretty fun stuff and then I've even done

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,260
a little bit of open-source the software

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,780
i made for my Master's research is open

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,330
source on github and was received very

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,040
well at the UM the large installation

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,090
system administration conference Lisa

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,750
back in 2012 I've also provided patches

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:03,140
for an entire to open source computer

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,000
games so I have a little bit of

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,460
experience in that world but mostly my

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,200
experience and open source came from you

00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,970
know discovering Linux discovering you

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,710
know the GPL in my freshman year and

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,920
while most college students go under

00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,810
some sort of you know a socialist

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,650
awakening mine was an open-source

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,570
awakening so but but deep down I love

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,550
education I love teaching I love

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,580
teaching people things and I've had to

00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,660
reconcile you know what I've learned and

00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,790
loved about the open source community

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,480
with my responsibilities as an

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,920
instructor so the goal of this

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,970
presentation if you can't see the slides

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,270
don't worry they're not important

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,070
different me not for you introduction

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,380
which we've just covered I'm going to be

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,060
talking about first of all you know the

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,560
technical part the fun technical part

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,000
that hopefully you know the developers

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,590
in the room can appreciate where I

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,300
created my own auto grading system

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,010
because the objective of computer

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,390
scientists we're lazy we don't want to

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,260
do anything more than once if we do it

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,200
more than once it's better to write a

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,370
program instead of doing it twice but

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,140
then I'm going to go into the real meat

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,480
of the presentation which is combining

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,820
the the technical the technical guts

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,970
with the educational philosophies of it

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:13,910
the the parts of good pedagogy that mesh

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,400
well with the open source the fun open

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,709
source hacky parts and then finally some

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,840
lessons I've learned you know as a you

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,590
know starting out teacher as a young

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,180
developer going his way into academia so

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,039
hopefully you will find some interest in

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,780
this I don't expect this will take the

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,340
entire hour but I'm always more than

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,530
happy to

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,389
entertain a lively discussion and since

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,490
we have so few people here that just

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:42,340
makes the discussion more more personal

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,690
right so start with a story as you know

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,919
like it's that I'm a computer scientist

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,930
my bachelor of the computer science

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,790
master's in computer science currently

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,350
pursuing a PhD in computer science I I

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,500
love programming I love computers love

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,169
technology and I love using technology

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,580
made my life easier in middle school my

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:00,490
first program was on the ti-83 plus

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,690
calculator where I you know took all the

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,850
formula from class put them on my

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,500
calculator not only was I using them on

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,389
the homework and the only examinations I

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,370
was able to fix a problem with the

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,440
instructors answer key because I simply

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,180
have my program a handy and ready so

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,710
from that moment forward I realized that

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,139
computers would do me a lot of good and

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,470
program would be very productive in my

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:23,650
life so fast for a little while going to

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,300
college particularly grad school I

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,680
realized something that I love teaching

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,150
teaching is wonderful teaching the

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,830
exciting you get you know to meet lots

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,470
of people and you get to talk in front

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,610
of a lot of people every day the five

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,960
minutes before class starts is very

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,850
awkward as you saw before this

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,070
presentation began but once I get into

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,200
it I you know I really have really do

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,389
love what I'm doing well I don't love is

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,470
grading grading is painful I hate

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,990
grading so much it's the worst thing in

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,979
the world has to be done has to be done

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,150
because students are there to get a

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,530
degree and without grades they won't get

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,919
one so they won't like you very much if

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,479
you don't give them great and here's the

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,910
thing about programming programming is

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,940
on computers and I'm also good at

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,050
programming computers I there should be

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,460
some way to create these things

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,410
automatically right there should be some

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,940
way to take computer student source code

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,169
and then find some way to automatically

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,060
assign a grade to them that requires

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,530
very little human intervention right

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,090
especially the ones who do everything

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,590
right if they get if they get all their

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,870
assignment right they're going to you

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,039
know pass allure tests they're not gonna

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,690
have any drunk how many bugs so the

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,070
compiled it runs there it's going to get

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,180
the right output they should get a 100

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,410
and I shouldn't have to look at it

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,340
because I don't need to spend my time

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,960
with Stephen to know what they're doing

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,050
my time these two fellows you into

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,849
action need my help right

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,280
so I decided you know what I'm going to

00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:34,289
make myself an auto grader but I

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,759
couldn't just make an auto greater okay

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,169
because AI wasn't the program will

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,129
myself because I don't have that kind of

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:43,259
time I have to graduate too so what I

00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,940
did was I was looking at some tools that

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,699
I used myself when I was soon I realized

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,990
hey there's the thing called Jenkins

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,150
continue anyone here who nurs know that

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,069
knows what Jenkins says only a few folks

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,930
so Jenkins is what's called a continuous

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:58,440
integration tool what you do is you host

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,080
Jenkins on a server Jenkins can monitor

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,020
a subversion a github a mercurial

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,840
repository and every time I see the

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,240
change it will pull a change run it

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,770
against your testing suite and then tell

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,599
the user with a little happy face or

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,199
well blue circle or a red circle if it

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,069
succeeded or failed well you know what

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,889
that actually works really well for

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,039
trading programming once you say so i

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,300
did was i set it up sup a Jenkins server

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:28,500
made one repository for every to my

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,409
class told them all how to upload code

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,389
repository it so we we use github we

00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,500
have a we pay for an enterprise

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,319
installation of github on our own

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,690
servers we use github they submit their

00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,639
codes their github repository jenkins

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,199
periodically pulls it and then tells

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,789
them with a blue circle or a red circle

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,680
weather and i have passed the teachers

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:50,909
test cases okay not only does it take

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,830
care of that grading for me which I used

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,539
to do manually I used to you know write

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,099
a bash script that would iterate over

00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,810
every single student file which I

00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,000
downloaded from Moodle wish nobody named

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,120
correctly by the way

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,280
i edited through all the followers after

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,320
normalizing them randomly against my

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,430
script of tests and they had to manually

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,770
go through and read the test to make

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,720
sure they're all passing okay so that

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,700
was a pain cuz I have 80 students

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,810
I thought I've got very low students by

00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,850
the way if you're a Berkeley or

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,480
something they brag about having 800

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,380
students so I have 80 I'm very lucky

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,570
Jing has done that for me not only does

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,690
it do for me though it tells a student

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,550
how they're doing the one thing that I

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,400
hated as a student what I would submit

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,450
my work to a locker on moodle or

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,360
whatever the course management software

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,919
is I've submit my my my code there and

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,280
then like five months for the deadline

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,510
go all God does it actually compile did

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,500
I make a stupid mistake and submitting

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,320
it will have on the teachers off

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,120
hardware that's like the worst feeling

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,620
in the world that's really cool about

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Jenkins every didn't work get a red

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,380
circle if weird you got blue circle if

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,610
you got a blue circle i was working your

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,760
gun you're done you've got a 100 you're

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,810
done don't don't worry about anymore so

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,730
not over that we were able to solve that

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,950
problem too students weren't freaking

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,390
out about whether over on our system

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,899
they could see exactly what they were

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,389
going to get before the deadline

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,740
so my hope was you know students would

00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,420
start something work earlier by the way

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,379
that didn't happen they still all

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,720
submitted it right before the deadline

00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,170
but you know it felt good when I was

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,170
planning it

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,820
so the entire flow works like this as an

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,500
instructor what I would do that have to

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
make my homework assignment now making

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,160
all those github repositories is not

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,200
easy but luckily for us github has a

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,600
beautiful API for creating repos so I

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,370
just write up a Python script to do that

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,320
some very simple parameters number of

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,580
the homework assignment you know what

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,620
kind of files i expect the student to

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,650
use kind of our template we populate all

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,950
their repost with it and then we set up

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,970
the jobs on jenkins we start the

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,230
homework assignment we tell them what

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,640
the requirements are students or to me

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,050
their code on jenkins they don't start

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,410
immediately to start you know a day

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,930
before it's due Jenkins will pull their

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,880
changes and continue to send them their

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,870
responses while they do the work see

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,790
another problem the students don't will

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,630
do work at like you know four o'clock in

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,980
the afternoon to do work at three

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,020
o'clock in the morning and they I can't

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,820
respond their emails at that time so

00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,329
while I'm a sleeve Jenkins is telling

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,920
them how they're doing

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:18,110
you know so they say they get some

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,759
assistance and then ultimately the final

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:25,249
goals I get less emails and everybody's

00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:27,949
happier right so that's the setup I mean

00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:30,079
it's not it's not super super fancy but

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,480
I was I was very proud of it the rest of

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,799
the part was very happy with it this

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,119
summer we're teaching summer school i'm

00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,459
no longer I'm not teaching right now I'm

00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:38,869
doing full time research but my teaching

00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,239
mentor now is using that software to

00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:43,910
teach her summer summer class which is

00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:45,559
really really makes me feel good we can

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,059
all appreciate a good hack right we or I

00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:48,290
mean this isn't even this is kind of a

00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:51,379
hack is still very happy because it's

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,790
not documented but we can still

00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,189
appreciate the technical mayor behind it

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,069
but there's more to it than that there's

00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:00,279
more to it than the fun technical solve

00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:02,389
a problem using a program approach and

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,449
that's sort of what I'm going to you

00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,790
know get into so before I move on are

00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:09,049
there any question about the technical

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,319
thing I made does anyone here not have

00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:13,610
any idea what I mean why I say Jenkins

00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:18,160
poles github and give students their

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,160
answers yo

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,490
does jinkins give any points for

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,490
programming style

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,750
jenkins doesn't but we've been you know

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,430
adding new software to it as time goes

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,370
along there's a wonderful tool called

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,950
vera ve are a witch does style checking

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,480
of c and c++ code we integrate that into

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:48,430
jenkins and implement some style rules

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,630
it's a little bit obsessive we'll just

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,880
use that word will say it's obsessive

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,490
about the exact style but the cool thing

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,110
is we give the student line by line

00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,490
what's wrong with each line of style and

00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,830
the student can fix it all I think it

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,970
doesn't great is documentation but you

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,190
know the odds are if there are less

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,690
students who fit that profile of getting

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,100
it right and having bad style the

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,020
students who have Brad style and just

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,910
get it wrong anyway so you know that's

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,470
that's a population that's amount that's

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,340
substantial minority and we don't really

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,340
really worried about them

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,660
so whenever I'm teaching or whenever I'm

00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,100
developing anything in an educational

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,300
context I have to ask 33 questions the

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
first one is what are the learning

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:40,680
objectives or outcomes of the course I'm

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,680
developing the solution for okay

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:44,899
as a Linux open source user I would love

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,269
very much to brainwash all my students

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,180
into believing my way is doing thing of

00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,860
the right way right so I would love to

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,389
see everyone you think github just for

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,699
the sake of using github or you know

00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:57,559
using you know the proper brace

00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,759
indentation style just because I believe

00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,949
that's right but that's right there is

00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,899
not the learning objective every course

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,269
has a set of prescribed learning

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,899
outcomes written kind of like an IETF

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:11,089
RFC at the ends of course the student

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,670
shall and all capital letters shall be

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,589
able to write programs and see students

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,050
shall be able to write and test a you

00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:20,600
know right right at unit tests and so on

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,170
and so forth so the first place always

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,149
look is at those lists of shells and it

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,889
turns out there are two shallots at work

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,059
really well with this the first one is

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:32,089
that they have to use very good control

00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,230
of some and some capacity so hey awesome

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,180
get those virtual control let's use that

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,569
now so it fits in with the learning

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,430
objectives students also that we the

00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:43,670
full name of my course is CN software

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,720
tools which is really really flexible so

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,920
I can take any tool using software and

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,660
including the course and have no student

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,480
tell me the course in supposed to be

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,800
about that so Jenkins fits in well with

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,839
the fact that students will learn how to

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,970
use tools that professionals use to

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,079
improve their software whether it's

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,350
version control or whether it's

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,800
continuous integration testing testing

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,459
harness builders whatever

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,930
so I have to make sure that my my

00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,010
solutions map to the learning objective

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,570
the reason for that is because the

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,420
learning objectives are very carefully

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,060
made to avoid overwhelming students you

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,470
don't want to teach them you know you'll

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,360
want to try and cram too many things

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,490
into the already crammed packed schedule

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,709
you don't want to teach them things that

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,959
require all a whole lot of prerequisite

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,310
knowledge okay for example I might have

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,750
believed that pythons there than C but I

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,630
cannot put Python this course and get

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:38,709
away with it but then there's the second

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,079
part which is the needs of the rest of

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:44,260
the curriculum what I mean when I say

00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,220
that is when they leave my class what

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,740
are they going to be prepared to do in

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,450
their next class I have the very

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,870
wonderful advantage of teaching the

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,790
immediate class that follows mine before

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,829
I taught the class I taught last year

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,880
okay I taught the junior level before I

00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,790
thought the sophomore level so I could

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,529
refer my software for the junior level

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,730
it turns out that in that class you have

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,220
to use version control you have to use

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,420
continuous integration so I figured well

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,339
if we just introduced it to a little bit

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,930
earlier they'll be way better off when

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,810
they get to that class next time how

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,180
does your solution prepare students for

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,649
the rest of the curriculum okay every

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,870
class in itself is on it not a little

00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,010
vacuum you don't just hopefully you

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,600
don't just put everything down and start

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,430
anew with something new hopefully it

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,540
builds on the previous stuff because

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,520
when it does throw on the previous stuff

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,100
when students see what's happening from

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,050
one class to the next to take it very

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,450
seriously they really do because they

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,579
know that their success in the end is

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,220
being you know predicated on what you're

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:41,520
doing right now so that's that's good

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,520
thing no

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,640
and then finally what are the needs

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,040
outside the class when they graduate

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,180
when they go to the real world how does

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,230
what you're doing prepare them for that

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,360
I also believe that you know knowing how

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,610
to design a Turing machine by hand is

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,470
very very useful I'm not gonna get away

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,540
to teaching about my class particularly

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,830
because that's not something most people

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,889
do in the real world who here has ever

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:12,439
designed a Turing machine at their job

00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:16,429
I did not think so um but here's use

00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:18,199
version control their job anyone here

00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:23,779
use continuous integration Jenkins

00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:25,399
Travis anything we have we should be we

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:30,730
have a smaller crowd here so you know

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:33,010
the the numbers are interesting but

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,449
what's really cool is how students do in

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,130
fact latch on to it whenever you show

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,750
them that the tools you're doing are

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,440
done in practice there's two reasons for

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:45,760
this the first is has anyone here heard

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,649
web cat web cat is an educational tool

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,290
that does unit testing for education for

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,910
students taking Java classes it's made

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,230
by Virginia Tech you upload your unit

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,089
test there and all the students upload

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,410
their code and then it tells all the

00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,610
students how they're doing kind of like

00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,750
Jenkins does Kyle I continuous

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,810
integration except it's only for

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,490
teaching web guy tells student how to do

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,709
it how they do and they also give the

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,240
teacher you know a summary of student

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,630
progress and who might need some extra

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,799
help student 8 webcam the despise that

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,799
they really hate it

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,970
but Susan ah hey Jenkins despite us

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,790
using Jenkins for the exact same purpose

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:24,810
of web cat and being less user-friendly

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:27,720
because Jenkins was real drinking with a

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,850
real tool because if you have a problem

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,760
with Jenkins you type it in Google you

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,530
get all these mailing lists that you

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,780
know will have your exact error message

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,100
on that mailing list and the eight

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,320
clones that appear you know those

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,240
ridiculous websites that collect a

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,580
mailing list and archive them for Google

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,430
to find them so real developers are

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,750
using these tools and because real

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,330
results with using these because wheel

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,530
developers are using these tools there's

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,780
lots of resources for students who need

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,670
you need the extra help you know there

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,400
are tutorials well a lot of tutorials

00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:06,210
there are you know messages email lists

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,410
and ultimately it kind of leads to one

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,060
of the most important goals i try to get

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,600
every of my students to learn which is

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,970
google it before you ask me google your

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,410
error messages because that's what your

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:22,260
job can be do your job is going to be

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:24,990
doing that a lot giving students tools

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,950
that aren't made by teachers who keep

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,960
them for themselves and share them with

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,030
their friends using tools that

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,590
developers use they're very open about

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,940
when it they don't work because you'll

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,340
see angry blog post about thing you'll

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,170
see angry emails about them they will

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,340
get hopefully they'll get fixed but even

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,080
they don't someone hopefully has a

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,530
workaround for it and I'll help your

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,530
students out

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,190
hopefully I'll come back and see my

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,490
students in a couple of years and they

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,490
will tell me that they've picked that up

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,490
hopefully

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,110
and then finally

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,780
we asked you know what have I learned

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,100
when I've been you know in this teaching

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:13,580
capacity what have I learned from this

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:16,160
you know teaching job the first thing I

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,020
always do is check the syllabus the

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,900
syllabus is your Bible for the course

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,600
everything that matters all the desired

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,520
outcomes that the you know the students

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,090
need to get one they when they depart

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,090
your course

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,510
and then the second is to not introduce

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,070
too much information at once okay

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,070
students get overwhelmed very easily

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:46,940
one to coventry instructions but making

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,940
sure that you you you introduce tools

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,070
at an acceptable rate where they can

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,870
process each one and feel like they

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,549
understand what's going on they can feel

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,600
like they're in control of each one you

00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,710
want make sure they get to master each

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,440
tool before you introduce them to

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,190
another one case in point for the junior

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,730
level software engineering class we make

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,830
students do all their work on the clips

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,450
we make them do they believe T some

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,970
databases for the first time so they're

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,480
using jdbc java database connector

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,070
yeah java database connector um they

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,720
have to do JSP for the first time so

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,460
they're making a interactive live

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,559
website that's a tomcat for the first

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,360
time the whole first week of class is

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,020
here are all the tools learn them all

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,280
before week two most students still

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:39,409
don't know how to set up half the tools

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:42,480
before week 4 it's overwhelming but by

00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,559
my goal with my my tool was well let's

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,659
take some bows tools teach them at the

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,730
class right before it that way at least

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,940
leave master to a few of them so be

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:54,559
review when they get to the junior level

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,559
and then

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,980
most teachers who are already already

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,150
have their jobs they're not interested

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,429
in anything is gonna make their lives

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,659
harder okay me I'm a grad student trying

00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,580
to impress people I want to get a job

00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:08,400
when I graduate so I'm always happy to

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,510
go forth do the extra unpaid labor and

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,750
make a coolatta grading tool

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,950
but if it doesn't make the doesn't make

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,300
the incumbents job easier they don't

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,150
want anything to do with it because then

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,290
it's something else you have to learn

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,870
furthermore if it doesn't improve

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,800
learning if it actually gets in the way

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,869
of learning it's not worth doing in the

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,710
first place

00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:34,139
there are some caveats to that but for

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,759
the most part my toll did both because

00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:38,070
students reflected very positively in

00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,239
their course evaluations they really

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,070
appreciate being able to work with this

00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:43,289
Jenkins tool because they like the

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:47,989
feedback they had you know instant

00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,989
feedback for what they were working on

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,080
and they appreciate the ability to do

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,480
you know some work with real tools and

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,100
one of those important things the most

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,899
important things was they had the

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,200
opportunity to use version control

00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:05,279
before working in a team before this

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,259
experiment you introduce version control

00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,440
for the team assignment and you never

00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:14,860
used it for any individual assignments

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,240
okay one see any problems with that the

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,590
biggest problem with that is that team

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,279
assignments are super-high pressure and

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,690
very emotional it's bad enough they have

00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,330
to do the project but to throw an extra

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,919
software they have to learn together

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,929
while they're doing it that is a recipe

00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,820
for disaster so what they do is because

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,009
they're using github to submit their

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,509
homework to me they've used it for three

00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:36,340
whole projects before they did the team

00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:37,600
assignment they stopped the work

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,419
together that still gonna be very

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,320
painful but it's not the fault of yet

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:44,340
hopefully because they probably ready

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,340
how to merge conflict by then

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,830
so that's about that's the prepared

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,080
content for today you know it's very

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:03,679
lightweight it's very simple I made a

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,860
tool I connected it with my with my key

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,749
priorities of the teacher I deployed it

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,039
and it was successful most of time it's

00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:14,659
not successful this time it was i was

00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:16,009
very lucky but are there any other any

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,499
other questions there any other like

00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:20,509
detailed topics about open source and

00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:23,470
education that they like some insight on

00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:23,470
go for it

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,880
the question was do I see Jenkins be

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,980
able to grow more things than

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,650
programming assignments when you say

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,660
more things that could be you know

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,580
several something so though the nice

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,320
thing about Jenkins is that it works

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,180
well because the way Jenkins works is

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,820
you simply write a bash script and it

00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,320
will run it on everything it sees that

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,610
was appropriate for my use case because

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,260
that's how I grade in the first place it

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,200
was just a matter of taking that bash

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,730
script um it has is anything that could

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,680
be great automatically could be done on

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,150
Jenkins because what you all you have to

00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,030
do is write your script let's say I'm

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,650
grading algebra okay and I come up with

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,800
some sort of way that students can type

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,920
up and a set of algebra steps in a text

00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,300
file they can submit it and if I can

00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,850
like write a Python script I can parse

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,830
that and then either return a success

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,470
exit code or a fail XD code back up to

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,370
the Jenkins process it will give you the

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,470
blue or red dot

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,330
the advantage of Jenkins of course that

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,620
you get to deploy it on a wide scale you

00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,590
can even personalize it for every

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,600
student if you build that to your script

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,940
and the other other beautiful key thing

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,559
is that Jenkins keeps track of all the

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,970
failures and successes so you get to see

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,100
you know how students are doing over

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,170
time do they flounder and just fail and

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,210
fail and fail trying random things or do

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:44,250
you see a gradual progression towards

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,240
finally getting the getting the point so

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,980
Jenkins is an automation tool that works

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,440
well when you have all it worked well

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,470
over a large set of repositories so if

00:24:50,440 --> 00:25:00,520
you can classify your assignment into

00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:01,780
that then yeah it will work it does a

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,790
system with Jenkins to have a

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,340
possibility to communicate back the

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,110
student may be what may be wrong with

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,800
their code that they submitted what area

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:15,290
they need to focus to to correct it

00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,440
so the way that we coded ours was we

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,570
have a script that has a list of inputs

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,770
and outputs we do black box testing we

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,140
have a script with a list of empaths and

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,520
outputs and then by default we just

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,490
showed them the Jenkins we just show

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,200
them the Jenkins log running test one

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,840
test one succeeds running test you test

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:37,010
two fails you know expected blah blah

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,620
running tests 323 succeeds technically I

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,350
could you know and I did this I could

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,980
add whatever on extra output I want to

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,600
just by echoing it to the console so if

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,280
a particular test fails and I know that

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,140
test is looking a particular part of

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,850
code then I could provide a special

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:59,270
message for that it's just a matter of

00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:02,240
it's really hard to anticipate all the

00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,920
error students can make and in general

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,570
it's not even worth it because you're

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,100
anticipating all the wrong ones so not

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,950
only do i do do a bunch of work in

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,410
advance you do it for nothing so that's

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,150
the only downside of that but you can

00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,800
customize the extent that you can

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,660
prepare for things and encode them into

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,660
passing and failing responses

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:31,990
I can see where its most ideal if you're

00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:34,809
using this for yes and no type of

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:37,480
response or a multiple choice but how

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,889
would a student really get legitimate

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,649
leverage let's save for calculus problem

00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:47,470
algebra and you're doing steps there's

00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:50,259
not going to be the option of partial

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,320
credit and as mentioned before as far as

00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:57,789
a program the uniqueness that you know

00:26:53,320 --> 00:27:02,070
something as far as the method which is

00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:07,330
more ideal and might capture more

00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:09,820
possible you know pitfalls etc so there

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,710
I don't see it where the student really

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,980
is going to get the leverage if you're

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,570
just worried about the final output

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,919
that's a great point thank you um so

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,080
there's a couple of points i can raise

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,879
to address multiple parts of the

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,110
question one part of the question was on

00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:28,179
partial credit yes it's true that we

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,139
only show them a we don't just actually

00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,509
it's not true we don't only show them

00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:34,269
the red or blue dot because we show them

00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:36,700
you know that log file and our rubric

00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,740
the one we give to our tas is measured

00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,389
based on output of that log file so the

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,610
students see exactly what our T's are

00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:44,049
grading by so we show them the rubric we

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,029
show them what matters what counts more

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:47,649
what counts less so the student you know

00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,529
hopefully will develop the metacognition

00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,999
to go through and review that there has

00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:55,869
been some research which I didn't bring

00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:58,480
up that giving students the rubric is

00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:59,799
very good because they can they can get

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,019
a chance to think like the instructor

00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,549
and that encourages more critical

00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:05,139
insight to the way they're doing their

00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,909
assignments so we give them that

00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:08,470
opportunity and that's one thing I

00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:11,230
should have included on my reasons why I

00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,749
did stuff the step-by-step part is

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,850
absolutely more difficult the

00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:18,659
progression is very important for

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:22,840
example I was just reading a paper today

00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:25,090
on the fact that that was trying to

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,679
divide up the parts of computational

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:31,539
thinking some elements are very you know

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,159
isolated like can people do loops can

00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:35,410
people do repetition you can see that by

00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:39,680
simply looking at their code

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:42,020
other elements require you to see things

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,090
longitudinally you need to see the way

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,520
that they're changing does a student run

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:49,970
a program test it see it fail and then

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,350
fix it and you're right it's very hard

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,240
to do that when all you're doing is you

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,440
know checking did they break the build

00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:01,400
or not my current technology does not

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,580
help with that and I cannot imagine

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,720
technology that will do it for you the

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,050
only thing that we can do at that point

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,690
is get a you know get a human greater to

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,340
go in and spend that extra effort but

00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,600
you also have to keep in mind is the

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,590
time you're spending on that

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,950
fine-grained tutoring is it

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,950
cost-effective

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,309
your standpoint I can understand that

00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:28,049
but from a student who wants to keep

00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:31,760
their GPA up and is working extremely

00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:33,780
hard you know every point one manners

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,460
you're absolutely right I'm just saying

00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,169
in fairness I see it from your

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,770
perspective I do Barry and I think

00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:44,179
ultimately it is most ideal for multiple

00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:46,980
choice yes no but I am hoping that

00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:49,350
everyone who uses this approach and the

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,590
outcome isn't correct they go back and

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:55,440
they they give fairness to the student

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,340
to look at that that's it yeah you're

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,610
right that you're absolutely right

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,720
that's that's extremely important and

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,770
what's really great about this approach

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,760
is it cast their really the idea is to

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,200
these approaches these automated

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,130
approaches are very much bias for

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,200
students who are already getting things

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,409
right what's really great about them is

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,760
that it helps you um more effectively

00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,130
use that little bit of time you have so

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,200
that way you can prioritize the students

00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,320
who do need the extra help you can

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,340
actually you can actually preemptively

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,950
find these students who may not be

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,909
asking for help and may may just be

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,100
waiting for you know the unstructured

00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,110
you know to ask them how are you doing

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,539
you know what's really great about this

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:37,350
is that the binary classification right

00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,730
or wrong it does hydel it hides a lot

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,200
but sometimes they can raise the

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,850
attention of the students who do know

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,169
that extra help that you can help them

00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,539
with that one-on-one tutoring that they

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:49,020
absolutely need to ensure their personal

00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,159
success by freeing up instructor time we

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,500
can more cut we can more effectively

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,940
help the student to me at most

00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,820
hopefully hopefully that helps I'm you

00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,820
know hopefully that okay

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,659
I see that you said they started using

00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:20,440
it the next semester with someone else

00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:23,740
using it what it sounds like is it

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,960
worked it saved time the students got

00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,149
into it we're going to make it part of

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,809
the curriculum how do we get this

00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:34,090
knowledge on a broad scheme get other

00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:37,149
universities doing the same thing or

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:42,250
other departments or other how do we

00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:44,679
make it spread so what my adviser wants

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,210
to do is turn it into an open source

00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,860
project managed by the University and

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:54,909
you know managed in the sense that we

00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:57,340
hosted in general most most universities

00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:59,919
will prefer to you something prepackaged

00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,149
that is plug-and-play so the way you get

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,070
to spread is you make this plug-and-play

00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:04,750
thing work and you talk about a lot of

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,179
conferences and then the other school

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,700
bill you know other enterprising

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,340
teachers will start using it and you

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,260
know it snowballs from there you know

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,120
basically lots of the advertising from

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,500
the academic circles is word of mouth so

00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,630
if there's a really cool tool that you

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,950
like first personally find a teacher

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,149
who's going to like it and then they'll

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,190
start talking about it on their mailing

00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:27,250
lists and that's how all of it spreads

00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,250
you

00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,650
one last comment you might want to look

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:46,040
at rational team concert if you're doing

00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,600
some type of open source because that

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,020
incorporates that whole concept of

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,480
Hudson / Jenkins and it includes like an

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,390
instant messaging so the students could

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,810
be part of this collaboration within the

00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:04,130
group etc but it's a more elaborate of

00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:07,160
course corporate commercial product but

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,980
it has excellent additional features

00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,760
that might be helpful that's really cool

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:16,370
you said um are it's called RTC for sure

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,490
but rational team concert rational team

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,450
concert ok that's really cool another

00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,570
thing that's important to know about

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,650
schools that they are not averse to

00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,870
university or not averse to spending

00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:30,220
money on solutions that look like they

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:32,870
can have success in multiple classes

00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,340
sure a really nice solution is the grad

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,920
student who does it for free in a spare

00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:40,010
time but if they want if you know if

00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,030
they if you get a few teachers within

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,520
the university to bring it up as a

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,100
faculty meeting oftentimes they will be

00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,320
happy to pay for the educational license

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,200
as a very of various professional pieces

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,510
of software yeah it's definitely worth

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,580
looking at and it incorporates rational

00:33:53,510 --> 00:34:03,050
developer rdz it's absolutely fabulous

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,900
very strong developing tool as well so

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:08,330
you can see the dips right side by side

00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,270
you can diff different versions you can

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,760
see who made changes I mean it's just

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:16,090
worth you looking into yes L spectacular

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,090
thank you

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,550
are there any other questions or

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:26,120
comments

00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,120
other

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,220
curiosities

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:38,270
when you say houses so how successful

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,010
has this tool been proven tour I only

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,970
used it once EMES tur so this is

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:46,850
brand-new I developed it to address like

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,909
I said the shortcomings of the gap

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,409
between this class and the following one

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,270
so I developed this as a stopgap measure

00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,250
we won't know that but my advisor would

00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,470
like to see some formal studies

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,300
published working on this tool so we can

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,800
publish it because once again a

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,940
university will make a tool they will

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,470
test on their own students that they'll

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,390
publish a paper and you'll get a couple

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,040
other users to buy into it that's how

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,990
web cat got started it was born out

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,360
Virginia Tech and now lots of computer

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:14,619
science programs are using it but um

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,619
yeah that's that still be done

00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,920
well it's aren't any other questions I

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,490
would just like to say that whenever you

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,420
see an RFP or a request for proposals go

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,800
ahead and do it because that's what I

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,970
did I just respond to all of them and

00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,610
that's high end up talking at these

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,840
conferences so you never know what

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,150
they'll accept you you don't worry about

00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,280
interesting or not until after they let

00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,110
you in so thank you all for your

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,270
attention I hope that this was

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,470
insightful I'll still be around for a

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,350
little bit longer if you'd like to talk

00:35:46,470 --> 00:36:01,380
to me offline but uh thank you all so

00:35:49,350 --> 00:36:03,120
much for thank you all so much your

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,650
customers rely on your website or

00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,050
application if it's slower

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,960
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,790
and costs you money keeping your

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,310
business critical systems humming along

00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:17,620
requires insight into what they're doing

00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,570
your system metrics tells stories

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,580
stories that can reveal performance

00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,920
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,480
other problems but how do you keep an

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,150
eye on all of your systems performance

00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,150
metrics in real-time and record this

00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,920
data for later analysis enter longview

00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,930
the new way to see what's really going

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,090
on under the hood the long view

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,160
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,620
of all your systems providing you with a

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,010
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,560
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,330
load and network usage click a specific

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,730
system to access its individual

00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:54,240
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,650
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,330
comprehensive network data including

00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,640
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,200
available on the network tab and disk

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,120
rights and free space on the disk

00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,970
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,490
displays usage statistics for individual

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:11,680
processes the system info tab shows

00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,900
listening services active connections

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,060
and available updates adding long view

00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,740
to a system is easy just click the

00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,900
button copy the one line installation

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:22,330
command then run the command on your

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,040
linux system to complete the process the

00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:26,230
agent will begin collecting data and

00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,069
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,619
start rolling

00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:32,989
use longview to gain visibility into

00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:36,729
your servers so when your website or app

00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,729
